Like a grooming process, especially on Instagram, because you follow one hash tag to another hash tag and it's grooming that person to self-harm more, consider suicide more, and maybe even take action on that. It just needs to be shut down. I just... There are children literally dying every day from something that we can help prevent and we are not doing it. </p><p>I don't understand it. At 5.38, he found her lifeless body... Mallory Grossman was just 12 when she ended her own life. Her mother, Diane, believes she was bullied to death, in part on social media. Now, she tours the country, sounding a warning. One high school had nine suicides in one year. Nine children. Hindsight is cruel. Hindsight is very cruel. That's the toughest thing to cope with. Yes, it is. That, to me, is hindsight, that... I share that people think that the worst day of my life was the day that she died and I say, \"No, it's the day before, it was the day before.\" There's a million things you wish you'd done differently.

San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where big tech has flourished. But is it time for the industry to be reined in? It's amazing to me that as a father, you are willing... Definitely yes, says America's biggest charity dealing with online child safety. This is a huge problem and the lack of responsibility of the social media platforms is absolutely mind-boggling and absolutely disgraceful, so it is clear to me that they can and should be regulated. Journey's end, thoughts of home and, of course, of Molly. Molly is with me every day. I think all of her friends and family think about her frequently. She always wanted to help people. So I am pretty certain that she would be pushing for change so that young people were safer when they were online and that if they need help they could more easily find it.

Or you can call for free, at any time, to hear recorded information on 0800 066 066. And tomorrow night, we'll have an exclusive interview with the head of Instagram, who tells us about the impact Molly's death has had on Silicon Valley. Now, with the day's sport, here's Lizzi Greenwood Hughes at the BBC Sport Centre. Thanks, Clive. Good evening. Wales' head coach Warren Gatland says it wasn't to be after his side just missed out on a first World Cup final. They were beaten 19-16 in their semifinal by South Africa who'll now play England for the title next weekend. Andy Swiss reports from Yokohama. The anticipation was deafening, Wales fans hoping for history, could they join England in the World Cup final? Their passion was obvious. But they would need poise as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-bd257c721b2f4be1ad47eea6f3afb39d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC8-RV31-DY08-346P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Tech is the number two lobbying power in Washington. So sadly I fear that the measures will have to be tough to bring these firms to heal. Pinar, can this be done as an expert that last point in competition law? If I could pick up in terms of breaking up the number two lobbyer. So you're admitting there's even a bigger lobbyer than the tech giants. If we are worried Why aren't we discussing breaking them up? about political power we should also be talking about the finance industry, the health industry, the energy industry where we also see giants. We cannot compare the so-called tech giants to the monopolies which provided water, gas, electricity. Tech companies are nothing like natural monopolies. There is competition for a start on both sides of the market, so that's would be for a start, the crucial distinction. so much more complicated than breaking up another company in another industry. Elizabeth Linder, that question about money. The whole point of so many of these services is anybody no matter where they live can use them and you are served ads when you are using these products as a very innocuous way of paying for these services on the back end. But I think it's an important point because to flag the point about not really understanding how it is that you can build an idea on a platform is really reflective of the country we're in right now. We are having this conversation in a country that benefits from rule of law, that benefits from freedoms of speech. In so many countries where people are using these services they are using these services as the only way to have safe conversations that otherwise would be illegal in the jurisdictions. It's hugely important that this entire community works hard to keep these services up and available for those people. Luke Johnson, can I just come to you. You used \"bad, bad, bad...\" I lost count at the beginning of your remarks. Do you see anything good in them given what we've heard from those against the motion? I think if they weren't so monopolistic, - if they weren't... - They say they aren't. Which market? 85 percent of the market is a monopoly. It is a monopoly, it's obvious. - What's the market? - No better definition. Insert Google is a monopoly.

That's the question, we'll come to you soon. that's the question and will come to a lower number 4 days Number four, please. I'm against the motion I'm against the motion I think that and I think the proponents the proponents gave the game away on the big tech companies gave the game away on this when Rana started criticising this when runners started criticising the big tech for bringing disasters like Brexit, like Trump, companies for bringing disasters like Brexit like Trump like worst of all populist parties in Europe like worst ball populist parties in Europe because what we're seeing here because what we're seeing here is the is the death rattle of the old progressive monopoly. death rattle will This was a way of thinking of the old progressive monopoly this was a way of thinking wish dominated society which dominated society for many years for many many years and now and now people are being empowered by technology to disagree. people are being empowered by technology to disagree and all the criticism of these All the criticism of these big tech companies is coming from the left, big tech companies the progressives of politics is coming from the left the progressive politics were fed up with their monopoly who are fed up with their monopoly being taken away. Thank you. Here at the front, please. being taken away Thank you On microphone number one. done here front this my preferred number one Hi, I'm for the motion I am for my actions I was and I was just wondering, just wondering week with you are talking you were talking about the dreams about the dreams and the fact that Facebook and howl of the a Facebook of is made to unleash all those dreams me so I am sure those dreams but you're giving the impression that Facebook but you're so giving the impression that is a philanthropist's Facebook is for for this organisation. Facebook make money? I ask you how does organisation I you know how how does What is its business model Facebook make make money worries with its business model ensure that gives away as and surely that gives it away as well? well Okay, thanks. Elizabeth, of date Thank you it is within I'll come to you soon, our country the moment without first question but that first question about how do you split the companies? about how do you expect the companies Each company would have to be looked at in a different way each company would have to be looked - but let me say... - Can it be done? at It can be done. It has been done, by any other number of industries in the past. They fight against data privacy. They fight any kind of less Draconian solution that has been proposed, they fight against. So I fear, frankly, that there will have to be tough regulatory measures like a breakup to actually shift their power. And these firms have bought much of Washington. Tech is the number two lobbying power in Washington. So sadly I fear that the measures will have to be tough to bring these firms to heal. Pinar, can this be done as an expert in competition law? that last point in terms of breaking up the number two lobbyer. So you're admitting there's even a bigger lobbyer than the tech giants. Why aren't we discussing about political power breaking them up? we should also be talking about the finance industry, the health industry, the energy industry where we also see giants.

the University of southern California in Los Angeles now what do you make of what the President is saying whether you agree with them or not there are grave concerns aren't there about big tech and how it operates in a democracy certainly there has been a lot of concern about the way that big tech companies have can I read about says Hugh promote any kind of information including two of the show and our countries I think it's an interesting take are coming and the white house today considering that a lot of disinformation and propaganda God as proliferating social media I am the most tech companies want to feel that the white house and Republicans taking of Congress so it is an interesting moment I think that the real story here is concerned about its coverage collusion crimes corruption happening in us politics and it is that Aaron Hughes silence the critics Yes I think your research I read it right to point out the ways in which right-wing Nations have been able to manipulate Google and Facebook in Mr. Trump's favour and also that racial ethnic minorities in fact the a big cheque tend to work against them they feature less prominent absolutely what we find in the researchers had racial ethnic minorities women and girls are saying they are cannon fodder more disposable communities and these platforms and there are ways to actually the powerful read again politics who have a tremendous amount of waste and say I don't think the evidence is access Siri to bolster his argument went against everything is will desire to silence that media who are trying to investigate very real issue is happening in the way of and has to be said that the president and the sources that these sites class just about every mainstream news outlet as left-wing anything to escape a Fox News the wall Street Journal the economist and Daily Mail Dotcom quite a few people might quibble with that Yes I mean when you look get that kind of you know fan is a model that is being used to declare all media left wing it can everything short of InfoWars a break for a new one has to ask the question again and and why we spend a whole day the news cycle talking about that this rather than talking about issues that are here and you certainly can talk about regulation need to have consumer protection front a big tech company is Ian you can talk about the fact that the administration wants to silence political critique and the facts and evidence and those things don't have to enjoy its reserve Professor Thank you very much indeed the now a white police officer in the US who fired 5 bullets into Are carrying a group of teenagers has been found guilty of murdering a black 15 year-old Royal Oliver no longer works for the police killed Jordyn Woods in Texas last year the teenager was unarmed and leaving a house party on reclaimed the car was moving towards his partner but his colleague told the court he did not fear for his life the time and felt no need to use his weapon of could air pollution make us less intelligent research carried out in China suggests it might four-year study found the longer people are exposed to dirty air the greater the damage to their cognitive abilities and men are affected more than women as our science editor David Shukman reports a wave of pollution rolls into the centre of Beijing dirty air is the reality of life for many in China in fact for billions of people around the world as Sciences now know how it can damage the lungs and heart how can shorten lives some of the pollution we breathe then gets trapped in the nose for the tiny particles can slip into the lungs and then make their way into the bloodstream and there is evidence they can even reach the brain so pollution may not only have a physical effects but a mental one as well to explore what pollution might be doing to the mines scientists in China embarked on a massive investigation people's mental abilities can be affected by so many different factors but the task was never going to be easy this was one of the largest studies of its kind looked at levels of air pollution in dozens of cities across China and that the results of tests of verbal reasoning and maths taken by 25000 people in those places the researchers conclude that long-term exposure to air pollution impedes cognitive performance that is a bold claim it doesn't provide direct evidence of cause</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

see national records for June broken in the coming days but comparisons are being made to France's 2003 heatwave in which almost 15000 people died and sank Mali reports to Germany Hungary and Spain it may look as if people across Europe are enjoying the sunshine but for many the soaring temperatures are taking their toll and set to get higher the heat being experienced across much of Europe is down to a weather system over the Atlantic it is creating atmospheric pressure over the region drawn up hot air from Northern Africa and Spain this means higher temperatures previous record temperatures of

company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform the former UK deputy prime minister said there was a pressing need for greater regulation of the technology sector and media editor Amol Rajan has this report what kind of internet do you want the one most of us experience today largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants many prefer a more authoritarian approach of China which has its own tech giants Facebook and Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European Facebook this morning he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign we found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces there's a long way in that word significant of course Facebook themselves they always know everything about whose advertising on the platform the most striking claim today from Clegg is Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy election advertising and hate speech I think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important port and there's how technology serve society and in the end this is not something that the big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation His political enemies to Mark it is broken up and while the ideal an oversight board is intriguing is not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or or maintain its independence the former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduce the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram one of the platforms owns following the death of 14 year-old Molly Russell her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures the talk today was of a tech lash a backlash against Californian tech giant which Facebook says it has gone too far others think it has gone far enough let us not become complacent this is not over yet we have a lot of work to do as

I think those are a lot easier than when it gets to expressions of a policy or other forms that, you know, you can't even go through all the different variations. But I think there's going to be a lot of discussions in countries over the next year, especially around things like Section 230, which is a particular law in the United States that grants immunity to these platforms, and whether that holds or doesn't hold, that will really kind of give us direction on where we're going. But my overall opinion about this is that we have to be very careful about having governments control this, because it's a slippery slope.

all if the EU regulator the European medicines agency was in touch with the food and drug administration to seeing what process they go through and up probably thinking of a similar process themselves Yes so how widely might each be used in the UK well we have to go through a regulatory processes of the European medicines Agency Europe as I said them and that if they give the green light and the then the government Prins gives the green light for be used I can imagine it could be used very widely across the UK and certainly the doctors I've spoken to we are very keen to use it for their patience how much of a difference might it make in helping the UK get through the worst of this outbreak well I should preface flat that the answer to that by saying that for all major diseases such as HIV TB me can many cancers winning combination treatments to really have major effects and we've seen that through the ages renders it could be the first step in building a combination and an important first step in building that combination and if we can do that in a few months then hopefully other trials which tested other therapies which then show equal effect saw similar effects can be added trim is here to give us an even larger effects and reduce that Throat problem 12% down to 8% even lower Professor much Palmer from University College London we really appreciate you taking time to talk to you Thank billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett says the world has changed for aviation and has revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway investment fund dumped the shares in all 4 major US Airlines last month the conglomerate has a stake in major American allies including Delta and American Mr. Buffett also says US stocks could fall further Matt Wolf is a market strategist for multifarious consulting firm in new York Max thanks for joining us to what extent is Warren Buffett right that the world has changed radiation so this is a way out of this game branches take of comments I think the markets have agreed for two months to be seen as a hospitality space led by the airline's be down about 35 to 40% think the markets have a spectacular we call a dead cat bounce here It's where I already had a justifiable level but even that bouncer general euphoria you see their hospitality space flag green massively and the Airplane's didn't seem like they could be profitably ride with any kind of social justice Singh at all you have done for the past injuries for 20 succeeds to comply with the minimum so probably not profitable to run I think it's could be a while before people one of the the aluminum to bring each other's X rays and also where he met a pretty nasty recession which given out so I'm certain is not particularly good for the airline the history how much further it could stop the airline's full I think it's a pretty view absolute not look like the reform that much further for stocks are massively overvalued rates so the market is going through its staging a reading from the wonderful error when it paid no taxes and wages and had amazing profits then used was amazing profits here and The cost us borrow money to buy back their insurance which eye I'm retrospect it will be a folly of the last couple years but I think the markets are probably due for a 35% fall from hero as it depends on which country in which stocks because big tech stocks dominate the American worker and disease because are market cap we did if you can't work and so the markets are up by those stocks are overvalued probably but generally speaking the markets are probably at least test for those over the last what's your advice to investors members of the public people coming with and pensions all wrapped up in stocks and shares was much solution be taking half of the restart if they just take it is all right down and back up again I tell them to get as much Debuchy these everybody off the other red if you grow older you learn a lot just riding up and down up and missed a victory express these very wearable tech you are not likely to do that well I think that that basic profitability of big corporations around the world the unions for tough tough several years to recover gas has begun to recover I think that's the sort of very confident massive delusion we are beginning to figure out what the challenges we have an even bigger got to think about how the best that the best of the showers could be tough several years</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

in the mosque in time really Kelly was in earlier had analyst at London capital group we started with that reading on a date does create a lot of digital single market between the euro Eurozone or Europe Europe of course the US as well and but nevertheless the European court of justice is the highest court win in the EU and the beer basis that access to generalize spaces cannot be actually committed because people have a right to privacy so is an open quite a lot of dishes regards to the corporate end of this of course the likes of IBM Amazon of conning us open arms about the situation because it's the Ariane winters but Facebook all these big tech companies and a lot of small ones as well and some like 5 5000 companies it got it scrambled to change their ways they're not now breaking lol for bandits in administrative nightmare is really is because they have to store information and data within Europe rather transferring to the cloud-based service scenario you think not it means that we are we have more protection terms of our information which Eric a lemur we're on something like Facebook we assume is in your friends it's looking what we're saying this we're still a lot that we tell him he'll rape is about their privacy you were happy to share a novelist of online in on myself included a not we can think about the consequences of fanatic it's gone to be a major theme over the next few years in a privacy verses in of the fact that in all you are living it lies on line along the time leaving your phone was the one what's the time you know so it's them and it is very difficult to define privacy and you where we are in in terms of technology at the moment if ok there's a lot of the times and their impact as has been seen as seek a secret to a leaked document that has European plans to deport thousands of migrants back to the homeland yes this comes fairly To say whether going to be about 400 has a people went to the EU in the 1st half of this

been accused of response irresponsible rhetoric after most hardline speech and causing migrant numbers of clearly the that the Syrian scenario Under the refugee crisis is one thing prompting this and the idea is that we send migraines home it will create less about we know still warm nest really want to come here Sold at whether or not we have seen more on this today it is a different story it is obviously a lead Brussels document but you would imagine it's going to be quite a big story in life was going on at it it depends which had you read doesn't mean how you interpret what Theresa may said yes they David Cameron also spoke to the BBC about the dangers of with you call mass migration if if if you're as the paper for certain bent you say actually migrations good if you sit on the other side you say migrations bad really my question is is there any way tracks he definitively prove economically whether migrations good or bad because both sides use the economic figures to support their own argument know what's true what you in Germany for example I mean it's expected that though the big influx of migrants there could be very good for the economy because the coronation

where many countries in what we could loosely termed the West have had polls asking the question would you support a ban on Muslim immigrants coming to your country the numbers supporting such a potential ban are very significant it is not only an issue in the United States guess you're right and I guess we we have this is Sam surged all fun of entire immigration feelings in not only in the US but also in in in in European countries and ran from Germany we see that but the problem is of course that in the end if you introducing something like this should be able to prove absolutely that's the point right should be constitution or the judge said and why he does not believe it is constitutional to quite interesting speakers but with that 1st travel ban he he tried to implement in Washington state was was was against Trump administration and and filed legal proceedings the many many technology companies big companies like Apple Google exec Trevor all on board this time is equal high tech companies on how challenging this exactly we just got a jejune Hawaii razy razy a red flag here that elsewhere seem very quiet this time I'm not quite sure why because he's not a difference

that the Russian government did benefit from that benefit from the and the data that was captured but just to say once again Russia we hear the term Russia we hear hacking the US and Russia comes up again Yes and of course it's a steepening of prefer a rift between the two countries which shun what we're having a debate about involvement of Russian spies and hacking in the present a complaint to

away and we're still waiting and we have still no news of whoo yah who is planning to sell its core businesses to this is the internet giant course in terms of the earnings news we know that it saw its losses widened to 440 million dollars that's in the 3 months to the end of June and investors were expecting that news it was not worse than expected but there is no update on the company's plans to sell its core search and advertising operations on that the tools so shareholders getting used to the roller coaster ride that is a Yahoo is chief executive <person><nameText>Marissa Mayer

companies including a controversial at the time the micro blogging website Handley paid someone point one billion dollars that in the last two years after she took over Yahoo's the 3 have said two years after she took over Yahoo's share price roughly tripled cynically the action was good but in 2014 things started to change the company's share price took a tumble after the Chinese retailing giant Alibaba floated in new York Yahoo owns a massive 15 % stake in that business when Alibaba shares began to think so did the Yahoo so the next plan was announced earlier this year to sell is struggling call business now this new was announced at the beginning of the year with several big tech names among those said to be interested but as I said no news on that will talk to an expert about Yahoo later Cos on Netflix shares in the web streaming giant falling in after hours trading on wall Street after it said it added fewer customers than expected the company signed up 1.7 million new customers in the 3 months to the end of June that is well short of the two and a half million it had predicted the firm has blamed the disappointing performance of cancellations by customers because they're facing a price increase it would seem the competition is getting hotter will talk about that and we had the other business stories join me if you can in about half an hour so well thanks Sally the international Olympic committee's don't hold emergency talks to consider demands for the entire Russian team to be banned for the Rio games next month it's because a new report which has accused Russia of operating a state sponsored doping programme for 4 years across the vast majority of Olympic sports that summer and winter sports world anti doping agency says Russia should be excluded from Riyadh are correspondent in Moscow was Sarah rainsford Sarah this sounds like something from East Germany in the 19 Sixties it's an incredible report Vladimir Putin says what that he once hard evidence he said several things he also released a history he talks about the 1980s when there was a boycott of the Moscow Olympics by Western countries who are angry at the is sending troops into Afghanistan and then tip it up because of the next Olympics in L.A. he's saying that basically this is politics getting involved in sport to gain a suggesting that there's some kind of effort to tarnish Russia's image and so calling for politics to be taken out of sport but he does acknowledge that there is a problem to investigate at least because he said that officials who directly named in the report will be suspended whilst Russia carries out what he calls an exhaustive investigation but at the same time he's struck a skeptical tone he taught about the so called doping scandal and suggesting therefore that there is something not Syria This certainly questioning at the nature of the evidence within that report itself so Russia clearly think shaken by the revelations that have come out the press here skeptical about whether they're authentic game here in the newspapers talking about some kind of attack on Russia but as well a lot of concern looking forward to the decision potentially today for the international Olympic committee on whether or not Russia entire higher team could be banned from Rio one terms authentication certainly the original whistleblower was actually a Russian who was in charge of the Russian anti doping agency was a he was then and in a sense that's kind of why Russia's questioning his evidence they're calling him a scandalous figure saying that he had been the subject of an investigation here inside Russia some years ago that allegations that he himself was involved in violations of the anti doping regulations and also people staying here or suggesting here just one man's word can be taken as the only evidence that something this serious but of course the wider investigation goes far deeper far broader than that it names multiple names on it it looks set to be the report's author talks about looking at hundreds of thousands of documents that hard drives and doing extra experiments to corroborate the words</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

away and the government there is keen to know just what the big tech companies are doing to ensure their platforms won't be manipulated by foreign governments or others senior executives from Twitter and Facebook will answer questions from the Senate intelligence committee today and the Facebook's operating officer <person><nameText>chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>is expected to say the social media giant has already disabled nearly 1.3 billion accounts that's a staggering sum and the firm has doubled the number of people it has working to combat this information on the site Meanwhile Twitter boss <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>is likely to address concerns over censorship and he says that Twitter does not use political ideology to make a

arguing that social media firms need to take more responsibility for what happens on their platforms but it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as one of and that goes for fake news for foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake it was my mistake I am sorry I started Facebook I run at I am responsible for what happened here so that gives you a taste of what's to come today James Erskine is director of marketing turned social circle I asked him what we should expect there's a real moment I'm here whereby no longer these big tech the social media platforms are brushing these things of this mission that things have got a challenge that's started about two years ago when she pointed a number of fake accounts being culled in the new tolls and new people have been brought to the table to ensure this this doesn't happen again the reason why it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation because it's almost impossible to regulate the space is impossible for a number of reasons one these social John Lawrence of that the majority so ago across so many different borders and they also get across so many different platforms so was good through Instagram which is owned by Facebook might be good for Twitter so Really really tough to get the right level of regulation works across territory and work across different platforms are they fighting a losing battle therefore because of course you know we've we've said that Facebook is the said they have removed all taking down 1.3 billion fake accounts that's an enormous number like is how on earth do you police this and therefore do we have to accept the fact it any manipulation it cannot be stopped I think if you look at the different social media platforms as that platforms then I think there has to be an element of responsibility team

actually go to Google in fact 90% of all searches online happen using Google why these States attorneys generals are looking into whether Google started using those searches nstead delivering their own site over any other sector and that would be really anti-competitive behaviour and would make it very difficult for anybody else in the market place to come in and try and sort of tackle Google's There's another investigation into Facebook as well and so they are really feeling the heat on the tech companies absolutely the certainly in a lot there's a lot more focused being placed on these tech companies look if you look from the consumer point of view consumers are not feeling very happy with big tech this show and there are not very careful with people's data we've seen that they can be influenced by outside 4in it influences and so now we see that there's a lot more sort of government that's trying to get in maybe perhaps even try to regulate these companies or what kind of regulation could we see could they be forced to give up their monopoly status that's certainly one thing you certainly see that a lot of people and see some of these big tech companies be broken up there are just far too big and they just hold for too much dominance that said there are some people that believe what ultimately there's not that many people that had the kind of expertise but these particular companies have and what will probably see is more regulation put onto these companies are not necessarily seen them broken up smearing saying Thank you so much for joining us with all of that analysis that well tomorrow sees the release of the testaments one of the year's most eagerly awaited novels is Margaret Atwood's sequel to the Handmaid's Tale which came out in 1985 and it sees a return to the fictional world where women a little more than slaves story which has gained a new audience thanks to the any award winning TV show arts correspondent Rebecca Jones has been speaking with the author the world she sees it can be a terrifying place and in a career spanning 5 decades Margaret Atwood's vision is as disturbing as ever I mean and people have statues but I didn't give me one miles still alive so starts her latest novel the testament in which she returns to the nightmare future she created in the Handmaid's Tale 30 years after she wrote it the television adaptation brought the book to a vast new audience in the novel America is ruled by real just fundamentalists and women are reduced to sexual slavery Margaret Atwood thinks its message of oppression has never felt more relevant young women of reproductive age you're always in the majority in any society they feel that they are there on the verge of having decisions made about them and about their entire future invade and body and help that they have not been able to decide and after the election of Donald Trump the Handmaid's Tale took on new resonance in America and beyond women have adopted the striking uniform worn by characters in the novel to protest against laws restricting their rights It's a brilliant demonstration strategy and the cars you can kick them out because they are not saying anything the and selling very modestly and Ukip kick them out because they're dressed in properly carried out but everybody look at looking at them knows what they mean there's so much hype fanfare associated with the tests I apologise well do you feel any pressure at all know it is a book is not a regime change It's not a riot and Moscow tonight breaks and dare I say it is there's actually a book the weight may be over but no danger then of Margaret Atwood getting caught up in the excitement but at the age of 79 having written 50 books and winning more than 100 lives free prizes perhaps that's not surprising Rebecca Jones BBC News I remember reading the Handmaid's Tale in the 80s and finding both chilling and great things I cud Was sequel and remember you can find much more on all the day's News at our website including the very latest on the Brexit drama and Parliament being suspended this evening for 5 weeks us to see what we're working on any time do make sure to check out

documents is very extensive we counted over 150 different companies that Facebook has partnered with and the types of Shane is for Merion uses mean we have things that have access to people's personal messages friends emails It's it's very bright and very deep but I thought Facebook was supposed to fix this they gave all those assurances back in the summer what happened that without this progress because of fitness fix this as well one of the main issues I think here is why Facebook has to continue to disclose partnerships but only subsequent reporting on it seems like it would be in Facebook's interest in the user's interests and I would make my job a lot easier if they were just more forthcoming about the different partnerships they were entered into so why aren't there I think it's because is that Facebook in some of these partners they fundamentally operate in a world where the transaction people's data is fundamental to their companies and so the idea that they wanted to help people that this trading and the deed and access to their data actually flies in the face of the business model for the most part so given the fact that this is so entrenched in the digital age can anybody stop pet well I think there's a good chance that British lawmakers could put a stop to it in this respect there is the opportunity for the US federal government to put a stop to it the Facebook is under consent agreement for for practices in 2011 were misleading Its users it seems that there is potential here for that agreement I did and that could lead to further regulations and fines here Europe clearly has put in place the GDPR protections I don't think Facebook is going to do it on its own I don't think these books partner companies are going to do it and there are other we have seen some device makers including Apple certainly tried to distance themselves from Facebook so would certainly appear that it's quick down aces and governments both here in the United States and abroad to help rein in these big tech companies very briefly gave what about users do they care there are two billion of them will have we just lost all idea of privacy I think that's a great question and I think it's fundamental to how we ended up where we are today when Facebook launched the idea was that you were actually it was based around the idea of a crime scene was based around the idea that you were only sharing this information with your friends and Facebook grew they decided it your friends should also grow it was in their interest to your friends turn into friends of friends and then those friends of friends started to include Microsoft in am resigning Yahoo in some of the other companies we discussed the Union even know your friends so I didn't think users still have an interest in privacy and I think as we continue to expose more of these data-sharing arrangements users who perhaps did not know that their basic information and sometimes more personal and private information was being shuffled between these companies will in fact surges stand up and demand more pricey but it might mean they have to start paying them of money for gay dance thanks very much for joining me since President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement the focus shifted to what states and local communities are going to do to combat climate change but you probably wouldn't expect to find Republican mayor in this Texas leading the way the majority of the people that voted for Donald Trump and it's a region where oil and gas reigned Supreme as our North America

As many of you know, it's one of the largest financial institutions in the United States. The Company is in over 12 states with over 1800 branches. As we've seen over the years with BB&amp;T, the Company has grown both organically and through acquisitions and certainly they had the announcement earlier this week acquiring -- purchased an assumption of the deposits and loans of BankAtlantic.</p><p>With us today is Clarke Starnes. He is the Chief Risk Officer. He's had this position since July of 2009. Prior to that, he was the Chief Credit Officer. Clarke has been with the Corporation since the early 1980s and has had numerous positions throughout the Company over this time period. With that, I will turn it over to Clarke. Clarke.</p><p>CLARKE STARNES, CRO, BB&amp;T CORP.: Thank you, Gerard and good morning, everyone. Thank you for the opportunity to share what I believe is a very positive update and outlook for BB&amp;T. I see a lot of familiar faces out there, but I would remind you all that BB&amp;T is a very high performing, growth-oriented regional bank holding company. What drives our business strategies and our low-risk, long-term risk appetite is a very unique value system. We believe this has created, in our opinion, the premiere Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern banking franchise with nearly 1500 -- I'm sorry -- nearly 1800 financial centers and about $167 billion in assets.</p><p>Remind everyone a key tenet of our growth strategy is we believe that brand presence, market presence and distribution of density is very important. So it's our stated objective to be in the top five in all the markets we operate. We believe that's very important to have an efficient general banking operation. And what you'll notice is that we're basically there in the majority of our markets with excellent opportunities for growth in our new markets such as in Texas.</p><p>I do want to talk about how we distribute our general banking services. We think it's a unique distribution model. We've operated a community bank, local-oriented, high service distribution platform for nearly 25 years. A lot of people talk about local decision-making and community bank style of distribution; we leave it every day. We believe we are the best in it and that distribution is supported by large bank operational risk management oversight.</p><p>I'm going to talk in a minute about, and give you a little more color around some high-growth opportunities for BB&amp;T. While we're very well known for our general banking operations, over the last 10 or 15 years, we believe we've built up an impressive non-bank business as well on our largest single non-bank businesses -- our insurance brokerage operation, number six in the US. We just announced this morning another addition to that group through the acquisition of the Precept Group in Irvine, California. Think that's a great, long-term complimentary fit for us. It does [EV] and healthcare consulting. We bring national distribution to their model. So we think that's a nice meaningful addition there. And we also have a number of non-bank lending operations that I'm going to dive down a little bit deeper on today because they're providing excellent growth opportunities.</p><p>The theme behind my remarks today is around strong balanced performance. Look, we're not naive. There's a lot of risk, structural issues in the system, in the economy, in the regulatory environment, the fractured political landscape. We are not focused on those. We are aware of those, we're managing that, but what we would rather focus on are the opportunities.</p><p>And I think when you look at our third-quarter results and our outlook for 2012, you're going to see that we are paying off with our long-term investments to drive revenue, very strong fundamental core loan and deposit growth, excellent performance in de-risking our CRE concentration and improving our credit trends and even with all of the issues out there today, we don't see any backup at this point. I'll speak more about that in a moment.</p><p>And then again while others are forced into large direct cost-cutting programs, we would rather focus on reconceptualizing our business and generating more relative revenue for the dollars we spend. And what we believe you all ought to get out of that is that this strategy will enhance long-term shareholder value.</p><p>A quick look at the third quarter, we were quite pleased. This was the strongest earnings in three years. The EPS up 73%, $0.52. Strong revenue growth, our operating revenues linked-quarter were up 3.6%. I will show you that. That was driven by good strong loan growth primarily. Credit quality, a very bright story for us.</p><p>The noteworthy item -- nonperforming assets down on an accelerated basis almost 12%, loan growth 4.3% in total, over 7% if you exclude our targeted runoff portfolios in ADC and the Colonial covered assets. And then excellent deposit growth as we are trying to lower the relative cost of our funding mix, as well as improve our liquidity ratios in anticipation of the Basel requirements.</p><p>If you look at the loan growth side, a very positive story. I think the highlight here is that it was broad-based. So what we are beginning to see is the payback of a number of long-term investments. I'm going to mention a little more about in a moment. Strong C&amp;I growth, strong across all retail channels, cards, auto, mortgage and particularly we are proud that we finally turned our consumer branch-oriented retail that was noteworthy. Strong outlook there and then very, very strong results in the sub. So as a result, despite this slowdown in the economy and the challenges there, we are actually raising our forecast. So we think our growth will accelerate in the fourth and beyond and will position us for 2012.</p><p>I do want to dive down today and spend just a little extra time on two key growth areas in the lending side. I get a lot of questions about our results around corporate or middle-market lending and the growth of our non-bank subsidiary businesses. So I want to clarify what our strategy there is. We think this is a very positive story for BB&amp;T and a unique opportunity for us.</p><p>Remind everyone, BB&amp;T has a conservative risk appetite. One of the things we feel very good about is we don't follow the herd and just run to what's available. And I would suggest to you that's a lot of what you are seeing today in the marketplace, a lot of folks are chasing syndicated lending, indirect auto or what's available, not necessarily with a long-term commitment or expertise in those businesses.</p><p>Corporate lending for us -- and we define corporate more what you guys would call basic middle-market lending. Kelly King four or five years ago made a strategic decision that we needed to substantially invest in an underpenetrated area for us given our emerging regional status and our higher ratings. So we have never really played very much in this space. And so we dedicated enormous incremental investment over the last four or five years into the front-line producers, specialized expertise around primarily seven industry verticals that we write research for. It's very complementary to our corporate bank and our broker-dealer operations and you see those segments there.</p><p>We invested in the front room, we also invested in the syndications infrastructure, as well as dedicated specialized risk management in the credit area before we launched this program. And so we've been methodically moving forward since that time and now, given the market disruption, it's really coming back to pay off for us because we are being asked in the credits. Companies who were spooked by fractured syndication groups during the downturn, they weren't reliable partners. They view BB&amp;T in that light.</p><p>What we're not doing is chasing every big league table deal that is out there. That is not who BB&amp;T is. So, for example, one of our risk appetite exclusions is we don't do big tech-sponsored leveraged deals. And so a little factoid for you is that, year-to-date, in our shared credit production, almost 80% of the deals are a total deal size of $750 million or less.</p><p>And so the point is we are lending to companies we know, industries we have expertise in and where we have a meaningful opportunity to share in the noncredit economics. While others talk about having their credit teams help them take larger hold positions, we are doing the opposite. So it's very granular exposures. Our average commitment is only about $30 million, but you see the benefit. We're seeing substantial growth in that area. I would tell you most of the growth is coming in the new markets we acquired in Colonial -- Alabama, Florida and Texas and nationally along those specialized industry verticals. So it's a great opportunity for growth, but I will assure you that we are going to manage the risk extraordinarily well.</p><p>The other area I want to talk about today is our specialized lending group. I do get a lot of questions about this and again, this is a similar story. I actually created this group, organized it for the bank in 1999. And we've actually been in a number of these businesses since the mid to late '90s. And so John Allison previously looked forward and obviously was concerned about where would the great opportunities be in general banking in the future and suggested that we ought to think longer term about other ways to generate growth in more nontraditional areas.</p><p>And so the way we approached that is there were a number of particularly non-bank providers of specialty services that our clients were using. And so what we decided was to focus on those platforms, which have a pretty good integration tie-in to our general bank and invest in these platforms.</p><p>And so the way I think you all ought to think about this is a portfolio of companies. We have very strict limits and levels of appetite around this, so today it represents about a little under 8% of our portfolio. I don't ever see it being an outsized exposure. Maybe it is 10% or 12% tops. So we've got particular sublimits for each of the categories, but the way I think about it is you've got kind of a bifurcated respect from here, so you've got the highest risks, which are the consumer finance platforms. The most noteworthy is our nonprime auto business, which by the way is performing the best in the Company history, lowest loss rates ever, lower than 4% in nonprime. I suggest that nobody is doing that out there.</p><p>We also -- on the other end of the spectrum though is our low risk P&amp;C insurance premium finance business. That would be more or less a 5 to 20 basis point loss rate business. So what we want to do is blend that risk and have an appropriate mix to get very predictable results. We did have very fast growth rates this quarter, but a lot of that was driven by seasonality in our P&amp;C premium finance business. I would think more along the lines of the sustainable growth rate for this platform is probably in the high single digits to low double digits for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The benefit we think this gives us is geographic distribution. It's very granular and it nicely complements our general bank and frankly has been somewhat of a countercyclical hedge as the general bank portfolios stressed during the downturn. So again, we think these are two noteworthy areas of opportunity that are very unique to BB&amp;T.</p><p>Looking at the deposit side, like a lot of banks, we've had strong deposit growth, but for us our focus has been around not just generating excess deposits, but to try to improve our funding mix. And you can see that we had a nice linked-quarter reduction in funding costs. We think that will continue into the future. That will help us maintain some of the -- or slow down some of the deterioration in the margin as we move forward.</p><p>We also work very hard and Daryl Bible has done a great job in positioning our balance sheet to be very, very well positioned for the liquidity requirements on the upcoming Basel front. So that was part of the design in the strategy is to increase those funding benefits there on the deposit side and we'll talk about that more in just a second.</p><p>So looking at overall credit trends for the quarter, very strong. This is the fourth consecutive linked quarter that we've had pretty much broad-based improvement in all areas and what gives me comfort as we look forward particularly is the lower rates of inflow on the watch list, the early-stage area in the NPA inflows. So we think with our heavy focus on reducing our existing nonaccruals by the fact that we are not reloading that you're going to see continued improvement as we move forward.</p><p>You can see again the noteworthy 12% or so decrease in nonperforming assets for the quarter. We think that is sustainable as we move through the fourth and into '12. Unless we see a substantial backup in the economy, our guidance would be continued improvement as we move forward. And obviously the real benefit of that will be the earnings leverage we will get out of that lower credit cost.</p><p>I would note -- what is noteworthy for us, it is kind of interesting, is that we are now on the early stage, the 30 to 89, 90 plus, we are back at 2006 levels pretty much across the board. So again, very hard work to produce those results.</p><p>From a loss content standpoint, we're right where we told you we would be. Our guidance for you was that, through the end of the year, we would break the 150 mark. You can see we effectively did that in the second and the third on a core basis, 144 basis points for the quarter. And I felt very good about that because, again, to have that kind of loss rate performance while we were aggressively liquidating nonperforming assets was a very, very positive outcome.</p><p>I do want to talk about one point that we think was maybe a little less understood on the call and that was around a particular charge we took for impaired performance in the Colonial portfolio. That was -- just to remind you all, that was no P&amp;L event, but basically you have complex accounting around the impairment analysis of these pools. We have 41 distinct pools that we have to recast every quarter and certain ones of those pools can be impaired and we have to provide for those. And remember we provide for those, we have an 80% offset from the FDIC loss share agreement. So what you saw this quarter was about $53 million of charges against previously established reserves.</p><p>So the way I think about it is more or less a balance sheet reclass because those $53 million worth of loans already after effect of the reserve and the allowance had a net carrying value of zero. So all we are really doing now is we've actually realized the losses. They have emerged, so we have to reclass those off the balance sheet. The way you do that is to charge -- through the charge-off against the allowance.</p><p>Now what that meant to us is, the way you ought to think about the reserve benefit we got in the quarter, is our release, excluding that event, was $123 million against the core non-Colonial portfolio. That is very similar to the level of release we did in the second quarter. So we really didn't accelerate our releases in Q3 and the continued improvement that we are seeing in the portfolio we think is going to allow us continued credit leverage in reducing provisions over the near term.</p><p>There are a couple though. While releases are important as credit recovers, it is a big earnings driver for BB&amp;T, we also have, again, we think a unique opportunity. You all know our stated strategy around working through the assets a little more long term than others through this cycle. As a result, we have a large OREO book. And so the benefit we see as we look forward is there is a large carrying cost for that book, much larger relatively than others. That's an additional earnings lever we can and will pull as we move forward that could substantially provide an earnings lift as we go into '12 and beyond.</p><p>And so what you saw in the third quarter was a distinctive shift. While we have been working methodically the book down, very steady sales each quarter, we kind of embarked on a new approach as we went through the third. We think the time is right for us. There's good market demand for these assets. And so what we decided to do was to go ahead and accelerate some of the dispositions. And the other thing is we're working very hard not to take title. So you notice much lower inflows in the third quarter compared to previous quarters.</p><p>So what you should think about in all of this is that we are going to reduce this book in a more accelerated fashion several ways. We are going to take less through inflows, not take title. Where it's appropriate, we are going to look at the economic trade-off of whether taking a higher front-end mark would help us accelerate disposition and lower run rate. We think the trade-off will be very positive and we think we can do that without hurting our short-term earnings. So stay tuned for that. You saw that in the third quarter, a little higher OREO expense levels. We actually took a little bit more liquidity mark to help get started on this strategy. And had we not chosen to do that OREO, expenses actually would have been down. So that's what this represents as we move forward.</p><p>So what we think that will do for us, again, we've said this before, the headline number for us, we believe conservatively non-provision-related, we probably have north of $700 million in expenses that we will ultimately be able to get out of our cost structure as the NPA levels come down. And we've kind of lifted those out for you, but obviously the biggest driver is OREO. The point I would make is we are just beginning to realize some of that $700 million. So the bulk of that opportunity lies ahead as we go into '12 and beyond.</p><p>From a margin outlook, we still have good loan pricings benefiting us. We're right where we told you we'd be, the 4% range for the -- 4.09% for the third and we think will be about 4% for the fourth. We do want to add a little guidance for 2012 the 3.85% to 3.95% levels. What is really driving some of the decrease in the margin is primarily mix where we've added investment securities for liquidity, reasons we think most of those purchases will be done toward the end of the fourth quarter.</p><p>And then the other big driver is the Colonial accretion running down. But remember, we do want to make the point that, as the accretion runs down so does the negative offset in our non-interest income. And just to remind you all, for the first nine months of the year, that FDIC loss share offset was about $243 million. And as we go into 2012 and beyond, you'll see a $10 million or $15 million improvement in the offset that helps against that lower accretion.</p><p>On the fee income side, obviously just heard the gentleman talk about product redesign. We are very focused on that, but as Kelly said on the call, you stay in the house when it's storming outside and so we have been purposeful in a very methodical approach to looking at our product redesign. We have identified about $385 million of impact with Durbin, Reg E and posting order changes. We've worked very hard through product reconceptualization to offset we believe going forward over time, about 50% of it. And we're committed to working with our clients in a very client-friendly accepting way to find the other revenue.</p><p>Do want to make a point about efficiency and cost programs. Kelly mentioned on the call that we are not announcing a specific program name or targeting a cost-cutting number. We're approaching it differently. The way we want to think about it is this. We get the calls and the resumes every day from the company, employees of the companies that are going through very draconian programs and they're scared to death about their job. We know those kinds of approaches might work short term, but we think they are very risky long term to how you run your business.</p><p>So what Kelly has challenged our executive team to do is to reconceptualize from the bottoms up. So what I can tell you is going on is a very thorough program. Every senior manager in the bank is presenting to an optimization committee that Daryl Bible is heading. What's exciting about it is our employees feel very empowered and enthusiastic. I sat through a couple of presentations literally yesterday where those ideas are being presented to this committee. That committee will give a recommendation to executive management and we will begin implementation of those ideas as we go through the end of the fourth and into '12.</p><p>And we think the numbers will be meaningful, but we're not going to commit to a number because we believe that that's not the right approach for us. But I can assure you we are well focused on what we need to do to be highly efficient with all of the structural issues out there.</p><p>From a capital standpoint, obviously we feel very good. Basel III pro forma looks about 8.8% now. As we've said many times before, we've got four priorities in that order -- growth, number one, dividends, strategic opportunities and buybacks.</p><p>Do want to talk about the exciting transaction this week, BankAtlantic. A number of you guys I know have seen that. This very much is consistent with our strategy to be a top five player in the markets we serve. Frankly, for us, we haven't talked a lot about this out of the Colonial acquisition. The entry into Miami has actually gone very well for us. We sent two of our best bankers there and one of our best credit guys. We're really doing well. So this very much augments and enhances that distribution.</p><p>So it perfectly fit strategically for what we are trying to do there. It met our return aspirations very well, accretive immediately, meets our IRR hurdle. We think it was relatively well priced as far as the financial economics and most of all, it's a very low risk transaction as we've got a good bank/bad bank structure and on top of that, we've taken a 7% mark on the assets we are acquiring.</p><p>You can kind of see the pro formas there and why it's so important to us. It leaps us from number 14 to number 6 in that market. You can see the green BankAtlantic branches. Just a very, very nice fit for our existing franchise. So this was very, very positive. Employees are very enthusiastic. We've already met with the management and the new employees at BankAtlantic and they're ready to go.</p><p>So let me close here with a just a reminder again on how we started. We think we've got a very positive story for BB&amp;T. We are focused on the opportunities, not the challenges. The long-term investments we've made are paying off. Our credit trends are improving substantially. We are very focused on rationalizing our business for the future and we believe that will allow us to drive shareholder value as we move forward.</p><p>So let me stop there, Gerard, and see what kind of questions I can answer.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY: And Clarke, just a reminder to repeat the question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Yes, I think we've spent a lot of time talking about what does a normalized return look like and I think we talked you guys about eventually getting back well over 1 ROA and 15, 16 ROE, which is a doubling from where we are today. We have done a five-year forecast; we've looked at it incrementally. We believe the drivers are there to do that, earning asset growth, increased scale, big big reduction in credit costs. We are at 144 basis points of losses today. We think we can, on a long-term basis with our mix, be more down in the 60 to 80 basis points. So for us, the credit leverage is huge, as well as just improving our efficiency back to more normal levels for us. So despite the increased regulatory costs, we believe that those drivers will help us get to that over a reasonable period of time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Yes, the question is around reconciling or tying NPA reduction with the more aggressive OREO management and note sales and those sorts of things. And so what I would tell you is that, a year ago, we launched an aggressive note sales strategy for our commercial book. We put $2 billion in a warehouse and told you that we would liquidate that in about three or four quarters hopefully within the marks that we had established.</p><p>We successfully did that. I'm happy to report it's all gone. We were able to do that within the loss content numbers that I provided. And so what we are trying to do now is continue the inflow -- the reason we had to do that last year, we felt like we had to do it was we still had substantially high rates of NPL inflow. And so we knew without more aggressive action, we were not going to be able to stop the increase in non-performers without some more aggressive sales.</p><p>So we've been successful in doing that and that strategy has substantially lowered the NPLs, but also now with the rate of inflows substantially lower, we think we can turn our attention to accelerating disposition of the OREO. So what you will likely see is us much less willing to take title. And so what that looks like is resolving the credits while it's in the note form, that may look like some one-by-one sales or workouts with the borrower. That's what we've been doing very successfully; that will continue. That alone will drive a reduction in NPLs along with our normal sales of OREO.</p><p>But we believe by having less inflows and then turning our attention to again that economic tradeoff of whether we ought to accelerate sales, even if it means a higher current period mark because if you look at the leverage on it, it costs us 8% or 10% a year of the national balance just to manage the asset and then you've got large revaluation risk as you hold it going forward. And so even in some additional front-end mark, we think you'll get it back immediately on the run rate. So that is the way we think about it as we move into 2012.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Excellent question. The good news is we believe we can do this without substantially increasing our charge-off. So we thank for the fourth quarter, you are going to be in about the 140 to 150 range even with the strategy and you should expect, in 2012, that our charge-offs will be lower. So we don't anticipate that this strategy will result in higher charge-offs than the guidance we have previously given you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Clarke, two questions related to asset (inaudible). First of all, the BankAtlantic purchase. Can you give us a little better color on the BankAtlantic credit quality and how you've looked at it and how much yield (inaudible) on the portfolio? And then secondarily, in terms of the specialty finance business, obviously that's growing a little bit faster now that (inaudible)?</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Sure, fair question. One is around kind of the credit due diligence and insight into the BankAtlantic portfolio; the second around how we think about those credit trends over a long-term basis and managing those in the specialty finance area.</p><p>On the BankAtlantic book, I will tell you that we did a very thorough due diligence. We did a traditional due diligence. We looked at loan tapes and we actually sent a lot of people down to crack files the old fashion way. So we did a big sample and file review, so was not an abbreviated due diligence. We felt very good about it. They've worked very hard to bring down their problems and the way this deal is structured, as you all know, we didn't just leave nonperforming assets with the holdco; we actually moved all the watchlist assets. So all the performing criticized assets and classified assets were moved to the holdco and then on top of that, through due diligence, we identified not a large amount, but some additional assets they were calling performing that we would probably in our classifications rate as watchlist or nonaccrual. We excluded those as well and then we put a 7% mark on top of that.</p><p>And you have about a -- a portfolio that we're acquiring that's got about a 40% resi mortgage piece, 20% or so home equity, maybe 15%, a little under 20% CRE. So we think the bulk of the risk has been left behind. I'll be honest with you, I think we will do better -- I think we'll do substantially better than 7% mark, which is what our experience was with Colonial.</p><p>As it relates to the specialty businesses, we do try to manage those within a long-term loss rate. The way I think about those businesses, particularly the consumer finance pieces, which is probably what you're more concerned about, most of the commercial businesses here are very low risk, bank-like, is that they're not necessarily high risk businesses if they are managed well; they're high-loss rate businesses.</p><p>So for us, it's around managing the volatility in that. So when we look at our models and how we do stress-testing, we know how to calibrate the underwriting so that you tend to not have, if you do it well, the volatility in these businesses during shocks. And then the other benefit you get, a lot of these lend at the max legal rate. So when you go through tough times, while your loss rate goes up some, your spreads widen. So you get somewhat of a hedge there. So we think, overall, it's predictable and sustainable, but, to your point, we don't want to see outsized growth that could create risk that we are not comfortable with.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)?</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Question around how we derived or calibrated the 7% mark, what were our drivers? When we looked at this and we did our modeling, a couple of factors I will tell you that actually influenced the 7%. We probably could have done a lower mark, but didn't have real good visibility into, for example, in their home equity portfolio. You've got seconds behind somebody else's first. They don't really have good intelligence around performance of the first. So there is a little risk there.</p><p>And then on the resi portfolio, you have a level of IOs in there. It was also not -- I will tell you the resi portfolio is not Florida exclusively; this goes well beyond Florida. But you've got some IOs that haven't converted. While they're very seasoned, we looked within our models and shot some of that. And so those were the two principal areas that we raised our mark on; not so much the CRE. We know the CRE values pretty well in that market. We are working through those same kind of assets with Colonial.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Yes. I mean the -- I think the way the (inaudible) and the holdco thinks about that is that there -- I think the balance is about $600 million roughly in criticized or nonperforming assets that they believe they've marked substantially and they're actually working through. We chose not to take those. They believe there is enough value beyond their mark that will more than cover over time their obligations and TruPS. And so that really was their strategy was to make sure there was enough -- there was enough asset value in the holding company to meet those liabilities and obviously we were not willing at all to take on that risk. Nancy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Clarke, could you just speak to --given that I guess you said you're expecting sort of 60 to 80 basis points for long-term loss rate. Where do you think your reserve is going to end up? Do you have any sense of what regulators -- how the regulators (inaudible) going forward?</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Question is around -- we mentioned a 60 to 80 basis point long-term loss rate assumption and the question is outlook or comments around what a reserve level might look like with that kind of loss horizon. And I would tell you that, first and foremost, we don't really know. Some of the things that influence our thinking though is that just from a risk standpoint, we think that if you were in maybe the 2 times your loss rate range would be an appropriate long-term reserve. We are going to be conservative. So if you're on the high side of that, maybe that's the 160s. I have heard comments from some in the industry around whether the regulators are going to try to influence more of a floor on reserves coming out of the cycle and slow down the rate of releases. And I've heard whispers around things like a 2% floor might be in the cards.</p><p>But in our discussions with the regulators and obviously we look at the risk and we also have to think about what the new accounting guidance will be and all that uncertainty leads us to the conclusion we don't know yet. But our best guess right now is that for us that 2 times is probably appropriate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do you have any sense of what timeframe -- in what timeframe you might be getting that guidance (inaudible)?</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Nancy's question is around the sense of when we might have clarity around that. I think it's uncertain. I think as you go through '12, you'll know more. Again, FASB has got to clarify where they're coming from and then again the regulators have not been insistent upon any numbers at this point, particularly for us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Question is around there haven't been as probably as large a level of losses in the home equity portfolios as we would have predicted in this cycle or many would have predicted in this cycle. What events might change that or trigger bigger potential losses in the future? Our experience has been -- I can tell you our experience and this may well be similar to other places is that the bad actors or the strategic defaulters are pretty much gone and the people that are left, whether it's on the resi first side or whether it's on the home equity, generally want to pay if they can.</p><p>So I can tell you this, in our portfolio, the biggest driver is the rate of change in unemployment. So while HPI decline is a big factor too and certainly continued deterioration would cause more defaults, the biggest macro driver would be rate of change in unemployment.</p><p>The other thing that we also, common sense, but you see it in the modeling is those -- even in underwater resi and home equity portfolios, if there was original skin in the game, that performs better. So one of the things you really ought to look at is not just what the current LTV is is did they put something in it? And what we see is where there was down payment, even if at same LTV level to someone who didn't put a down payment, you have a different experience.</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY: Clarke, with that, we need to wrap up; we've run out of time. Thank you very much. Please join me in a round of applause.</p><p>CLARKE STARNES: Thank you very much.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

My name is Rich Baytosh with Investor Relations.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who made a trip to Greensboro today and to those on the WebEx listening. We're very appreciative that you made it to the event, and thank you again for all of you who joined us yesterday for an evening at the Institute.</p><p>We trust you had an enjoyable time and learned about the mission. Regarding today's schedule, at registration, you received a brochure with the agenda for the day and a description of the exhibits. On your way into the auditorium, you'd noticed that the exhibits were open, and they will be open all day during breaks and during lunch, but not during the presentations. We encourage you to stop by and learn as much as you can about each of these exhibits.</p><p>Now some housekeeping items. Materials for each presentation will be uploaded to BBT.com, shortly before each presenter. There is a refreshment setup in the back of the room and also outside for your enjoyment. And there is also a device-charging station in the back of the room. And as you exit the room, there is one up to the right. We have breaks scheduled throughout the day at 10 -- just shortly before 10 A.M. and again at 2:15 P.M., and there will be a lunch at 11:45.</p><p>We have a full schedule today, and there will be time for Q&amp;A at the end of the presentations with the entire executive management team.</p><p>And finally, we have our forward-looking disclosure statement shown on the screen as well as in Daryl Bible's presentation. The statement covers all presentations and the Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Now with great pleasure, let me introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly King.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>KELLY STUART KING, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: Our perspective is a very interesting concept. I hope that little video gives you just a way to think about your perspective on life. How many times do we get bogged down and focused and concerned about all the challenges and all the issues and all the problems we have and how tough life is for us. And then we got a different perspective, and we realized as how fortunate we are and how blessed we are. So we're very blessed, very thankful that you all are here. Thank you very much. Thank you to all of you that came last night. I hope your stay was enjoyable. Thank you, all of you for joining us on the webcast. We really appreciate you joining us as well.</p><p>So what we tried to share with you last night is that BB&amp;T is a different company. We're a different bank. We really are focused on trying to make the world a better place to live, and we are doing everything we can in that context to execute on our vision and our mission and our values. Those are the 3 things about BB&amp;T that are nonnegotiable, our vision, our mission And our values. That's important because everything else is negotiable. The world is changing -- the world is changing with blinding speed. We talked some about that last night, but I'll just reinforce to you that because the world is changing so fast, it is critically important for all that are going to survive and thrive to be willing to change in accord.</p><p>So BB&amp;T, you're going to hear a lot today about the strategies and tactics. Last night, we talked about philosophy, today, we will talk about strategies and tactics.</p><p>You're going to hear us talk about Disrupt or Die. You're going to hear us talk about building the new banks. You're going to hear us talk about pruning the old bank. And you'll see the transitional of slow of that as we extract expense load from the old bank, that is not needed today, and invest heavily in the new bank, in digital, in new delivery platforms, in lots of new products that you're going to purchase, that you're going to hear about. So this whole idea is about helping you understand better how we are transitioning from the old bank to the new bank to be positioned to this new world in which we live and so very, very exciting, exciting tasks.</p><p>You're going to hear us talk about some key concepts. One of the things that you'll hear about is us working with a number of consultants. As we go across the business and reconceptualize and reconstitute our businesses. That's all a part of this \"Disrupt or Die\" strategy.</p><p>There are couple of head philosophies that I had over the years, and I hope you will hear threaded through this that I think are pretty powerful. One of those is, it is better to have 100% execution of an 80% idea than a 50% execution of 100% idea. In other words, it don't have to be exactly right, it just needed to be really, really well executed.</p><p>John Wooden used to say that his basketball team, every time, one of his new superstars would come in with all of his great personal plays and say, \"Coach, we got to run my play.\" And coach would say, \"No, we're going to run these plays,\" and then player would say, \"Well, coach, you've been running these same plays for years. And everybody, when they come to play you, they know what your plays are going to be.\" He said, \"That's all right, I'll write it down and give it to them. Here is the reason we're going to win because we will be better focused, better trained, better shaped, we will execute better, we will win every time even though they know exactly what our strategies are.\" BB&amp;T is really focused on good strategies, but we're really, really focused on good execution.</p><p>Another key concept that you'll hear and that's threaded through all of these reconceptualization approaches, and this is a really important one and that is, every function in the organization should be performed by the person who is the least qualified, who can perform it effectively.</p><p>Every function in the organization should be performed by the person who is the least qualified, who can perform it effectively. That is the concept of empowerment. So if you think about that letting the least qualified person do the job versus the most qualified, which is what happens in most companies, you're constantly pushing down empowerment, which means you're constantly growing people.</p><p>So we say, at BB&amp;T, everybody in our company has to have a growth mindset. And so by having a growth mindset and our commitment to empowerment and pushing down authority and responsibility, we're constantly bringing up people into the organizations. And as people below you come up and that allow you to move up and the whole organization is growing through that process.</p><p>So this is a really, really powerful idea and is one that everybody you're going to hear from is working on. And I think you'll find it to be very, very refreshing and reassuring with regard to BB&amp;T.</p><p>BB&amp;T is a different kind of a company. We're a different kind of bank. We're building the new bank, and we're building it in a context of our philosophy.</p><p>Before I close and let the program get started, I want to just remind you of one thing I've said last night. This is the day that all of us have to make the world a better place to live. Don't forget the power of one. Power of one is about living every day as if it is what it is which is the God-given day you have to make a difference in the world. Don't get in the trap of worrying about yesterday. Don't fall into the trap of waiting for tomorrow. You can't change yesterday and tomorrow is not promised, this is it, this is your day. Treat every person with dignity and respect that they deserve and realize the reality of life, the essence of life is about the fact that we interact with people, our families, our friends, our coworkers, people we don't even know, we interact with them all the time and every one of those interactions is an opportunity for us to make a difference. And as you make a difference in those individuals' lives, then you make a difference in the world. The butterfly effect in (inaudible) seems to happen, that you'll never even be able to imagine and maybe never even know, because you took the time, you made the effort to try to make a special positive meaningful impact on the lives of those people.</p><p>Power of one has a really incredibly important concept to keep in mind, and I hope you will do that. So thank -- again, thank you all for joining us. We're really excited about the day. We'll all be around as we take breaks for questions. You're going to see a dynamic team. I am so proud of each and every one of our team. You're going to see some of us that have been around for a while. You're going to see a lot of new faces, new folks that are really, really adding major contributions to our company. And I think you'll enjoy every bit of it. And then, at the very end of the presentation before we go into Q&amp;A, this afternoon, which I hope you'll stay for, we are all going to hold questions till the end. Where we'll take all of the time you want to cover questions this afternoon, but I will tell you at the last presentation Daryl is going to be providing with -- for you some enhanced and improved long-term performance goals as we reflected on the recent changes in our environment. So we're off to a good day. Let's talk about BB&amp;T building the new bank. Chris?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LEE HENSON, PRESIDENT &amp; COO, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: All right. Good morning. Pleasure to be with you all and give you a strategic overview of the company. And when I'm finished, I hope that you will take away 4 primary messages: One, we operate in differentiated and diversified franchise in great markets. We are, in fact, maintaining our performance advantage of long term. We are, as Kelly said, reconceptualizing our business, so we're going to talk a lot about that today. And we have a deep and experienced leadership team and hopefully, you'll get to experience that firsthand. You know we do operate a differentiated set of businesses that really provides or strive for top-tier performance. So this business has really come together to produce diversification. It offers really stable, consistent and strong earnings growth. We set some targets over the last several years of cost savings. We have achieved those and it's through intense focus on expense control. Expense control is a huge part of Disrupt or Die. Disrupt or Die is really about, as you just heard Kelly say, taking costs out of our existing company, the old company, if you will, to reinvest in and build the new company, all while maintaining a strong focus on the client. You're going to hear that threaded throughout the day. But focus on maintaining a strong disciplined credit culture, achieving operating leverage on a consistent basis, at the same time, a strong and consistent dividend with a strong TSR. With the driving force behind all of this for us is to execute on our vision, mission and values. You heard a lot about that last night and that's under client support of everything we do.</p><p>So let's take a look at the franchise. As you know, we operate a Community Banking Model, and we've been doing for about 30 years. We've operated diversified set of businesses throughout the country on a national basis. The company was founded in 1872, eighth largest deposits institutional -- financial institution by deposits. Fifth largest insurance broker and we are broker, no underwritings but a broker in the United States and in the world. Second highest mobile application ranking in the industry. Over 1,900 bank locations and just over 36,000 FTEs serving 7.6 million clients.</p><p>If we look at our banking franchise. We operate primarily in 15 states. Part well, 15 states. Primarily, in 12 or 13 because we just spilled over into Indiana and Ohio with 2 to 3 offices. But we have top 5 market share in the primary operating states, about half of those. If you look at our weighted average GDP growth in our footprint, it really gives you a view inside our markets. So over 3 years compared to our peers, our markets have grown second fastest, 3.8% average GDP growth over that period of time.</p><p>We also are in 8 of the 10 -- top 10 cities for economic opportunity in our banking footprint. This is really the differentiating slide as a part of our strategy and how we run our company. It's really about diversification. You can see on the left, our diversification of revenue by segment and leads to the performance differentiation on the right. So finally the largest is the Community Bank-Retail makes up 44% of revenue; Commercial 23%; Financial Services 17%; and Insurance Holdings 16%. But the most important point is what it does for us on the right side. In the upper left, you can see a pretax, pre-provision net revenue over total assets for 10 years has grown faster than our national peers and the top 4 banks and we've done it, as you see in the lower right, with less volatility. So faster doing PPNR, less volatility, really result of running a diversified business and that is a key strategic difference for us.</p><p>This takes a look at our business. I'm not going to cover all of this, but give you a sort of quick rundown what the businesses bring to BB&amp;T? It's important to understand what they do. But it's also more important to understand what they bring us.</p><p>Insurance Holdings provides the largest non-interest income provider we have, provides just under $2 billion in revenue and it provides a broader product array. It helps differentiate our business and helps us act as a trusted advisor. Many times, our bankers use this product as the lead product, they call on a prospect. It happens every day. The revenue stream is very diversified, because it's not sensitive to interest rates nor is it subject to dynamics of the credit cycle. So on a downturn, this business generally stands tall and very helpful. A complementary business to insurance is AFCO/CAFO, which is one of largest insurance premium finance businesses in the country that we operate. You'll hear John Howard talk more about those 2 later today. BB&amp;T securities, in that broker deal, we operate really 2 businesses: BB&amp;T Investment Services, which serves our consumer investment needs for our consumer product -- clients throughout the footprint. And it's primarily only annuities and mutual funds. Then we also operate Scott &amp; Stringfellow, our full-service brokerage business. Interesting, 5, 6 years ago, we were in 2 or 3 states. Today, we're in all of our primary operating states. We've grown this business much faster on purpose to support our growing wealth business. We'll talk more about that in a moment. They're actually -- Scott's actually growing about 15% year-to-date.</p><p>If you look at Grandbridge, it's our national commercial real estate and multifamily business. It does finance and does it through third-party placements primarily, but also some on balance sheet financing. So what it brings us is really strong fee income to place in a secondary market and some on balance sheet net interest income. And Rufus Yates will talk to you more about those businesses. Regional Acceptance is our sub-prime into a smaller extent near prime out of the finance business and what it brings us is really strong risk-adjusted yields in a controlled operating structure.</p><p>Sheffield is our small take at equivalent finance. You saw a kiosk outside, it does UTVs like you saw there, it does jet skis, motorcycles, et cetera. And then Commercial Equipment Capital provides equipment financing nearly under [250] for small businesses.</p><p>The point I would make about those Sheffield and CEC is they're national, but they're also point of sale businesses. So as a consumer demand changes, the point of sale purchase in finance, we think it provides real good upside in revenue growth, again, national business. And Brant will walk you through more detail about that.</p><p>These are the recognitions, I'll just state a few, 24 Greenwich Excellence Award in Small Business and Middle Market for overall satisfaction and outstanding service. At the bottom, we will probably just name Best for Core Deposit Growth Strategy. The 2018 Bank Director Ranking and it's result of growing DDA, and you'll hear more about that today Dynatrace named us as the second highest mobile app ranking in the industry.</p><p>This looks at the -- right on this page, I think it's important page. Major accomplishments over the last 4 years since our last Investor Day. Part of one of our biggest accomplishments is the developing more digital capability when the primary items there as we launched our U platform and digital blanking platform, consistently ranked in the top 5 in the industry. We've integrated 5 acquisitions: Bank of Kentucky, Susquehanna, National PENN, 2 of our 4 largest insurance acquisitions. Swett &amp; Crawford in 2016 and Regions Insurance Group, which we just converted November 2, this month. Really excited to implement Financial Insights, which is a automated platform that does financial analysis for our small business and commercial clients. It really provides 2 benefits: one, as our RAMs walk through with our commercial client step-by-step, the performance of their company versus industry standards, it helps our relationship managers better understand their relationship and can properly offer products that's -- that are nice solutions for them. And also provide the insights to the client at how they might improve their business. Many of them don't have CFOs and financial people.</p><p>So we -- or the fact of their CFO. And we provide information that shows their performance versus their industry and point out ways they can improve their business and create value that stays with us. And David Weaver is going to talk to you more about that. It's about 80% automated. We're going to continue to file robotics and machine learning to it. We're going to take it to a fully automated model later on.</p><p>We -- as you all know, we spent about $1 billion on 3 infrastructure projects. A new general ledger, a new commercial loan system, a new data center -- state-of-the-art data center we opened last year. And we rolled out a new rebranding campaign with a new tagline, \"All We See Is You,\" and have really stepped up our digital marketing capability. And you'll hear Dont\u00c3\u00a1 talk more about that later.</p><p>One of the best things we've ever done, we continued our Lighthouse Project. Our Lighthouse Project is a community effort where we have actually touched 16.5 million people through the completion of 11,000 projects and over 640,000 volunteer hours of BB&amp;T associates. We've done it now for 10 years. If you want to learn more about it, we have a kiosk about the Lighthouse Projects outside.</p><p>One really big item for us we're really pleased with. We expanded our executive management team, added 5 new members in 2016, of which you're going to hear 3 of them today, kind of walk you through their initiatives. And then finally, we've launched constructed and launched -- opened, I guess, you'd say, the BB&amp;T Leadership Institute. This July, many of you got a chance to actually see that tour last night. But more important than just a building, it's what it does in order to help us execute our mission with our clients and our associates and our communities.</p><p>So we'll take a quick look at our long-term performance advantage. If you look at adjusted return on average assets, I mean, currently, we're at 1.51%. We've maintained through the 4 and 3 quarter year review period. About a 10 basis points premium on average. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 20.1%. We generally have maintained it about at 300 basis points premium through the review period. I think there's one quarter, we might have been 200. Fee income ratio, 42.2%. Generally about 400 basis points favorable to peers. Not the case in '15 and '16. You'll recall, we sold a company called American Coastal. It was a $140 million revenue company in the middle of '15, and so they have an impact on those 2 years. Our adjusted efficiency ratio, really proud of improvement we continue to make there. 57.3%, about 170 basis points favorable to peers throughout that review period.</p><p>Something you may not focus on, if you were to exclude one of our businesses that is both very unique to BB&amp;T and also very large, our insurance business. So what you might see is more of apples-to-apples comparison. So we're actually operating at 53.1%, which is about 500 basis points favorable to peers through the review period.</p><p>If you look at risk-adjusted net interest margin, we have 3.19% about 23 basis points favorable to peers throughout the review period. And then finally, NPAs 27 basis points and have consistently been at least 10 basis points favorable to peers through that period of time.</p><p>When it drill down into how we're executing on Disrupt or Die. I mean, you heard Kelly talk about that last night. You heard him cover this slide. I'm not going to cover this in detail, because you've seen it before. But I will make 2 primary points with you. Yes, we are going through unprecedented change right now with technology. No question about it. But if we were in -- today, anyone of those prior four stages, we would've said the exact same thing. We're going through unprecedented change.</p><p>The point is, we had opportunities and took advantage of opportunities at each one of those time periods, and we feel the exact same way about the one today.</p><p>We see it as an opportunity, and we're approaching it in that way. Second point I'd make is, in 2008, in Phase 4, as we were going through the downturn. The leadership team we had in place then for the most part is still in place today. So should we go through a future slow down, our hope is that, that would be a benefit to us because we have been through that once before.</p><p>The core of Disrupt or Die is really about reconceptualizing our business, as I said earlier, to reinvest and -- or take cost out of our existing company or kind of our old company to reinvest in and build our new company. I'll give you two examples. If you look at the top left, it's really about optimizing the branch strategy. So we took out 148 branches last year, we're going to do 171 this year, 150 or so next year. So total of about 20% reduction in our branches over a 3-year period.</p><p>If you look at the upper right, we've also been focused in at the same time on our nonbranch facilities. So we've reduced square footage in our non-branches. Last year, 7.2%, 4.9% this year 4.7%. And a little less than 4%, we anticipate next year. We already have bate on next year. A total of a 16% reduction in square footage in the backroom, which is huge. We anticipate reducing our electricity usage about 20% to 25%. And we're going to take a portion of those dollars then and reinvest in opportunities that you see around that page.</p><p>One of the primary ones that we made a lot of impact as I alluded to earlier, is digital. I mentioned that we're in the top 5 generally in almost all publications and we were ranked for our U platform. And I think it's because we have continued to iterate new enhancements every quarter and to keep it fresh. Last quarter, it was about new card controls. A quarter before that, it was about a new personal financial management tool for our wealth clients. And so the objective is to keep it fresh and relevant and we continue to invest in it.</p><p>We also -- beginning this year through Dont\u00c3\u00a1's leadership to roll out something we call, Voice of the Client, which is a new digital platform that helps all of our businesses. Again, roll out, beginning this year, all through the -- into next.</p><p>It gives our businesses near real-time client feedback, which helps them better run their business and informs them on what digital investments to make in the future.</p><p>We also made substantial improvement in our social media, messaging and also our digital marketing.</p><p>We will do over 300 campaigns in this year, 95% of those will have a digital component to them. And Dont\u00c3\u00a1 will tell you much more about that.</p><p>On the lower left, in insurance. We have a number of initiatives underway, improving the performance and profitability of insurance.</p><p>One of the ones that I will point out is robotics, which started 6 to 9 months ago, really digging into how we might improve a real paper-based industry still today. And through that, we have an implementation going in that we expect is going to save us significant dollars in 2019.</p><p>Refocusing on the Community Bank. About a year ago, fourth quarter last year, it became crystal clear to us that we had rich opportunities to really bring value out of the Community Bank. For example, this branch rationalization strategy takes a lot of time. It's really intense. Investing in new branches and growth opportunities, new marketing, be it digital or direct mail and a vast new -- a number of new products, which you're going to hear Brant walk you through. Or in commercial, where we're standing up with Financial Insights program, remaking how we deliver small business, real focus behind SBA lending and ABL lending.</p><p>So what we did is that we thought it made sense to double down in executive leadership in the Community Banks. So we asked Brant Standridge to come in the beginning of this year, lead the retail segment. We asked David Weaver to continue his focus on leading commercial so that we could get after those initiatives and realize value from them much quicker and it has worked great so far.</p><p>So those 2 fellows work with me to ensure that we still present a unified Community Bank model to our associates, but also how we face the community, and it's going exceptionally well.</p><p>We've been really pleased with the cost that we've been able to take out of the business and the improvement in efficiency. Things like we just talk about. The branch, the rationalization strategy, the nonbranch facilities, implementation of robotics, where we're really just in our infancy we're just getting started tremendous opportunity. Last year, we had a systemwide restructure. We took out 1,600 FTEs, about 4% or 4.5% of our workforce. And while we have a boss that gives [us a use] of consultants, we thought in the vein of turning over every rock, because we were darn serious about making this happen. We did decide to bring in outside assistance to help us stand up 4 new projects. And I'd like to introduce and walk you through those today.</p><p>The first is technology. So we brought in consultant to help Barbara and her team really begin to look at the business and technology and how we support the businesses from top to bottom. Started with organization review, went through the spans and layers review, reducing layers, increasing spans, taking cost out we're going to use some of that money to reinvest and while we are happy with our agile effort, there is much more we can do with agile and standing up DevOps to push it throughout the company. Also looking at implementing lean principles to do what we do more efficiently and took a hard look at our vendor relationships to take cost out. So we are clearly taking cost out in technology and Barbara will walk you through that transformation, but very, very pleased with what we're doing to align the business to be more business focused and aligned.</p><p>Secondly, John Howard and his team brought in an consultant in April of this year and really the objective was to look at the business from top to bottom. No holds barred. And that entailed a review of the operating models from wholesale and retail. It involved looking at the backroom of still a paper-based industry to automate what we can. And I would say that we have automation going in every single entity in some form or fashion in insurance today.</p><p>Secondly or thirdly, really looking at how the corporation interacts with this large business. If you think about it, insurance is larger in its industry than BB&amp;T is in its industry. And how we interact is key so that we allow them to be nimble and flexible to be able to take advantage of opportunities in an entrepreneurial industry. At the same time, bringing the heft to BB&amp;T to provide shared services where it makes sense, where we have expertise like data and analytics, real estate services, et cetera. So the purpose here is to unlock value for the next 2 to 3 years and there has never been a time that I've been associated with insurance business that I feel better about the improved profitability potential we have over the next 2 to 3 years. And John will walk you through his transformation later.</p><p>Thirdly, beginning in August of this year, we brought in a consultant to help us do a deep dive on organizational simplification projects. So we're starting at the top of the house, layer by layer, going through our management structure, reducing layers, increasing spans of control to design an operating structure that is more efficient and to help us make better and faster decisions in this company so that we would be more nimble. It's tough. We're about halfway through it. We'll finish it in the first quarter, but it's absolutely worth it. And it will make us better for having gone through it.</p><p>And then finally, we're redesigning our commercial lending process from end to end, truly when we -- from when we make the first call on the client to when the last loan is paid off at the end of that pay period. And the purpose here is really to simplify the process for our associates, our clients, to enhance revenue and to take out cost. And while all of these have cost implications, this has -- about 2/3 of this opportunity, we believe, is revenue as we get our audience more focused on their targets.</p><p>So this process, we just started in fourth quarter. It will continue through the fourth quarter of next year. So you can see 4 significant impactful projects we started at the beginning of this year will roll through the end of next year that will make a significant difference, we believe in our company, enable us to reinvest more heavily in our company long term.</p><p>I think a quick look at our leadership team and what you might expect from today. But before I do that, I just want to make a comment. This is a deep and experienced leadership team. We averaged 54 years age, 27 years with BB&amp;T, and we have 5 new members that brings a new fresh ideas. We've done that over the years. It's a very effective team and for one, I can tell you, I have been here 34 years, very proud to work with such a fine group of people.</p><p>So agenda, I'll leave that for you to (inaudible). First up, it's going to be Brant Standridge. Brant is one of our newest members, joined us in 2016. Brant is perfect fit for retail, and he started his career as a market leader or branch manager. He's been worked his way up to retail banking manager, running all the regions -- I mean, all the branches in a region. He then later ran a large commercial shop. He subsequently went and served as Regional President in both Atlanta and Dallas, comes back to us as a proven leader, very credible with the retail folks, because he's been there and done it. They understand that. And Brant is a natural operator and he's got a lot of very good initiatives in place that he will walk you through to show you how he's, in fact, turning the growth in retail today. You'll enjoy it.</p><p>Secondly is David Weaver. Dave is also one of our newest leaders coming in, in 2016. David spent his entire career in commercial lending, perfect fit for what he does. Grew up as an officer ran a large commercial shop. Been around the Triangle region of North Carolina for us. Later moved into a role, Commercial Executive Role, he managed the third of the regions in the system before moving into the President of the Community Bank role. Dave is also a perfect fit, very hands-on leader, really working hard to improve the effectiveness and efficiencies, and he'll walk you through his initiatives, and how he's making that happen today as well.</p><p>Rufus Yates joined us in -- joined Executive Management in 2012. Run -- leads our financial services segment. You might recall, that's a segment that includes large corporate and wealth predominantly and then all the businesses that support that -- those 2 businesses. Rufus' likewise a natural fit, and he was -- grew up as a corporate lender, is the principle of our broker-deal that supports well. And he's going to walk you through initiatives to show you why that corporate and wealth will continue to be the growth engine that it has been for our company over the last 7 or 8 years. And I think you'll find that to be very interesting as well.</p><p>John Howard, our Chairman and CEO of Insurance Holdings, came to us through the Crump acquisition in 2012. Where he served as CEO. He spent most of his career in the insurance industry. He's been in this role for 3 years and is doing exceptional job, transforming this segment. And as I said to you earlier, there hasn't been a time that I feel better about the upside we have in this business from a profitability improvement perspective. And he will walk you through the details of his transformation.</p><p>Barbara Duck, joined executive management in 2003. One of our longest-standing executive management members. She's spent time in operations and running production cycles in IT. She stood up our enterprise data office where she's still responsible for today. And also spent time in digital. So was the perfect choice for CIO in 2016 when we wanted to elevate technology in the company, by having it reported to executive management. And she will walk you through the transformation she has going on to better situate the company and align to support our business segments for growth as we go forward.</p><p>Dont\u00c3\u00a1 Wilson, our Chief Digital and Client Experience Officer. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 also grew up in the community banks. He spent time both in retail and commercial. Most recently, ran our regions in Alabama, then very successfully in Atlanta. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 has a passion for the client, and has also got the unique ability to reach out and touch large groups of people corporately to move initiatives through, which is why he is cast in his role.</p><p>You're going to see his passion come through as he really walks you through the digital marketing improvements we've made, he's really helped us Open online accounts faster today than we ever have. He'll walk you through the improvements we're making in client servicing line and also our digital investments and sort of what to expect going forward. You'll really enjoy hearing from Dont\u00c3\u00a1.</p><p>You all know Clarke Will. Clarke is, I believe, one of -- is the longest-running CRO in his respected position at the top 20 banks. His steady hand gets a lot of credit for helping us navigate the downturn as successfully as we did. And he will walk you through all the risk initiatives that he has going on in the updates they're in.</p><p>And then Daryl needs no introduction to this group. Daryl is also the longest-running CFO, I think in the top 20 banks, and I think</p><p>one of the most talented balance sheet managers in the country.</p><p>Daryl will bring together, as you heard all the business presentations, all the numbers associated with that to give you an idea of kind of what to expect looking forward.</p><p>And so I hope I've given you sort of a quick overview of the company and what to expect today. And I'll ask Brant to join us and talk about retail.</p><p>BRANTLEY J. STANDRIDGE, SENIOR EXECUTIVE VP &amp; PRESIDENT OF RETAIL BANKING, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: (presentation)</p><p>I tell you every time I see this, I personally think about my own family and the journey that we're on. This is something we're really proud of. It was our partnership between our bank card business and [John Teddy] and his marketing team. And I was intended to be rolled out as a part of our digital platform. We've delivered this through digitally and through social media predominantly and it's had a significant impact. I would just share with you that, this ad highlights 2 things that we're trying to do in our business.</p><p>The first is that in a world that is obviously evolving quickly from a digital perspective, we have to find unique ways to connect with our clients emotionally. Kelly, described it well last night, the quality quotient is changing and what used to exist in a relationship between a banker and a client inside a branch, now exist in many other places and one of those places is digital, and we have to use things like this to connect with clients emotionally. The second component that we're working really hard to do and this ad highlights is to think about what we do in the products that we provide, the services that we provide for the clients in the context of how they fit into the lives of our clients. And so we think this ad does a good job of highlighting that. I would also just point out that the ads been quite successful, in fact, this actually came out in early August. It was intended to accompany our rollout of new products in our bankcard business and since coming out in August, we've actually had over 65 million unique impressions that this has generated and that has driven over 300,000 visits to bbt.com and driven really substantial digital sales associated with our new card rollout. So we're very, very proud of it. I'm excited about being with you today and really talking around 4 themes: Kelly talked a lot about our responsibility to disrupt our businesses, to find ways to create differentiation and specifically in retail what is a very crowded space. And so what I want to spend a little time today talking about in addition to giving you a financial overview, are what are the -- what are our things, what are the things that are guiding how we go about that disruption, what are the things that are guiding, how we go about creating a differentiated space for BB&amp;T in the marketplace. The first of those themes is how do we organize? How do we ensure that we're organized appropriately to create the right focus and accountability? The second piece of that we'll spend some time talking about is the client experience. Dont\u00c3\u00a1, and I both are going to spend some time talking about the client experience, it's incredibly important, and the bar is changing and Kelly described it really well last night and so we want to spend a little bit of time talking about how we're adjusting to that. Thirdly, we'll talk about some low hanging fruits, some revenue initiatives that exist today, as the world evolves, our ability to generate new revenue opportunities combined with the 4 theme of how do we optimize the existing business is what provides us the field to be able to invest in the future of the organization and so we'll talk about those things as we go through. Just the level said and Chris has already covered this well, our retail bank and Community Bank retail and Consumer Finance businesses comprise 44% of the revenue of the company and 43% of the net income. To give you a little bit further breakdown, there are 6 business units that comprise our Retail Community Bank and Consumer Finance segment. The first is obviously the largest -- represents half of our revenue, which is what, happens in the retail community bank. Chris, described it really well but one of our advantages in going to market in our branch network is the partnership that exists with our Community Bank approach, where we have all of our lines of business, whether they're commercial or wealth or many of our fee businesses are organized and really unified at the local level to deliver a integrated experience to our clients. And so our retail community bank is a big component of that. We also have our what we call our card-based services businesses, which can comprised of our retail payments, operations, our bankcard operations and then we have a fairly significant merchant acquiring business that's a part of that. We also have our mortgage business. Our mortgage business is from a retail perspective located inside of BB&amp;Ts branch footprint, but we have a Mortgage Warehouse Lending and correspondent lending business that's nationwide. And then that's backed up by a fairly large servicing operation. We have our dealer retail services business, which is comprised of all our indirect order that includes prime and subprime and includes a company that we have up in the Northeast called Hann Financial. Chris mentioned already, Sheffield and CEC, and I hope you all will take a moment to cruise our booth for Sheffield. I understand that a little bit later they're given rides on the four-wheeler if anyone's interested. But this is a very unique business that we have that our clients in this business are first manufacturers. The vehicle or recreational vehicle that you actually saw in the lobby was made by a company called BRP, and we have an agreement with BRP, in which we finance their product with promotional financing across the country and Sheffield does that in a number of verticals and has been very successful.</p><p>And then lastly, Commercial Equipment Capital is our small business, small ticket, equipment finance business. One point I just want to make, when you think about these, there are a number of our consumer businesses that are actually national in scope, and I think that provides us with a fantastic platform to continue to expand. From a financial perspective, I just wanted to give you a quick overview, first of all, we're pleased with where we see the trends going in our segment. I would start by saying that we have been through a couple of years of optimizing some lower yield -- lower yielding portfolios, you all are well aware of that. But given that we're reaching the end of that and some of the new products that you all are going to hear about and new revenue initiatives you're going to hear about, you begin to see, and you see this in the top left, that production trends are really moving in the right direction. That, on the other hand, is leading to balances that are now beginning to grow. From a deposit perspective, we're also pleased with where things are going. Now when you look at the 2018 results, they're year-to-date and as you all know there's seasonality in deposits, but we're really pleased with how overall deposits are growing and specifically we're very pleased in how retail DDA is growing. That's really the game going forward, and you all will see that since 2016 our retail DDA balances have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 11.1%. Those -- that turnaround for the loan portfolio perspective improving margins with our loan portfolio, increasing deposit margins led by holding our betas as low as well as driving more DDA, combines with modestly income growth is led to the revenue growth that you ultimately see. You may ask where is the DDA growth coming from, and I would just point you to a statistic that we watch fairly closely, which is the number of net new accounts that we're generating. Dont\u00c3\u00a1, is going to talk a little bit later about our digital effort you'll see we have over 3 million clients that are on our digital platform now and with the work that we're doing from a digital marketing perspective, combined with the performance of our branch network, better attrition results are leading to a massive improvement and what we're seeing from a net new account perspective, and you can relate that to a net new relationship perspective. The Group's also doing a good job of managing expenses, you'll see in 2018, our expenses are going to come in lower than 2017 and that is predominantly driven by what's going on with the branch network, we'll talk about that in a moment and the rationalization of that network and that's ultimately leading the positive operating leverage. If you look at 2018, we're headed towards 3-plus percent positive operating leverage and very excited about our results. So that's a quick overview. I want to spend the rest of the time and just give you a sense of the road ahead and what are the -- how are those themes driving actions within the business. And I'll start with our organization, as Chris alluded to earlier, one of the things that we did in the beginning of last year was to organize our retail businesses together, really centered around the client. In my view, this creates higher level of focus, higher level of accountability and frankly, as Chris described it, a lot more capacity to address the evolving needs of our consumer clients and there's tremendous competition in the retail space and so how are we best positioned to deal with that. In my view, this -- these organizational changes really give us 4 key opportunities: one, it ensures that the products that we create, the direction that we take, it's consistently focused on the client; the second piece is how do we create amongst all these businesses, to touch retail client, how do we create a consistent experience; thirdly, how do you take what is a very diverse set of platforms and utilize those platforms to provide a better experience across the board and so we'll talk about some of the ways we're doing that; and then lastly, this also provides a diverse set of clients. And we have the ability, some of those are local, some of those are national and so how do we leverage that to continue to expand our business. In addition to formal organizational changes, we've also made some informal changes. At the beginning of this year, we set up a group of teams, we organized around 6 different subjects, we're calling these teams revenue teams and each of these teams is comprised of folks from all walks within the organization. It's really everyone in the organization's responsible for these efforts and that includes our compliance partners, our audit partners, our marketing partners, our second-line credit partners. These groups get together once a month with the sole goal of what kind of progress or improvement can we make with either a product, a process or policy to deliver better products and services to our clients and do that quicker. One of the things that we know is the world is evolving and changing and is doing that quickly, and we have to have the structure necessary to respond, and we believe, as you will see in a moment, the structure's actually given us an opportunity to roll out products to the client, make changes in processes, much faster than we would have been without the structure. The second component, I would mention, is the effort around our client experience. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 is going to spend time talking about this as well, but I just wanted to make a couple of comments and how we think about it. And I think, Kelly's description last night of the quality and what does quality mean, in the retail banking space, was exactly right. 15 years ago, it meant the relationship between the banker and the branch and the client that walked in. Today, it's much broader than that. It's what is the experience look like at the ATM, how does it feel in the care center, and more importantly, what can I use my -- your digital platform to be able to do. And so as we think about the client experience, I can share with you that as an organization, we're collectively working to ensure that in all of these omnichannel points that we're providing a consistent experience to our client base. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 is going to show you some statistics a little bit later that show you the improvement that we continue to make and what clients are saying about the omnichannel experience they have with BB&amp;T. I would also just highlight 3 examples of where this is taking shape. All 3 of these examples are digital examples, the first is in our card businesses in providing our clients additional ability to control their cards and also providing our clients more interactive fraud alerts, obviously, in this space, fraud is a big deal, it's a big deal for our clients and so how can we make that easier for them to access. And in our subprime auto business regional acceptance, we had the ability through the work of Barbara Duck and her team to provide a payment application, the team actually created this in 6 months -- less than 6 months and this has frankly made a big improvement on our borrowers' ability to make their payments. And in a business where that is a pretty important component, this has been not only good for our clients but also good for the business. Lastly, I would just mention our online mortgage application process, which is we think a fantastic digital experience and in fact, 23% of our new mortgage applications are actually coming through the digital platform. So the businesses -- our mortgage businesses partnership with Dont\u00c3\u00a1 and also Barbara in our IT group has really allowed us to continue to evolve and improve this platform to drive even more of our mortgage experience through this. So those are 3 examples of things that we're doing to think about the client experience in a more holistic way. I would take a moment and also talk about new revenue opportunities because, as I said earlier, our ability to generate new incremental revenue opportunities, and our ability to prune or optimize the old organization is what leads to our ability to invest in the future of the organization. So I just want to mention a few examples of what we're doing to generate new revenue and the first is how do we create more differentiated products. I mentioned to you earlier, the work that our revenue teams are doing and that -- those revenue teams give us the ability to deliver product process faster and these are just some of the examples that products that are either rolled out in the last 6 months or are rolling out in the next 6 months, that have substantial revenue impact on our retail organization. I'll give you a few examples. We have the ability to work with our deposit products team to create a new savings product that has been very successful since roll out in June. We also have the ability to roll out a small business, free checking account, which has been incredibly successful on a short period of time, and I'll talk about how that blends with our focus inside of our branches. I mentioned earlier the new bankcard products, and our digital ad that accompanies those new products, and I would just mention to you that our bankcard business with the help of those new products, new production is up over 40% over last year. So very excited about the progress that is continuing to be made there. I would also just mention quickly, you all may have seen yesterday a press release about our recreational lending business, and we're going to begin to take that nationwide and that is not a new business for us, in fact, as you all know we've been doing that in Sheffield for a number of years but one of the things we have not been doing in Sheffield is focused on the Marine business. And as you all may have read one of things that's happening in the Marine business is that the power sports companies Filer's and BRP are making a lot of acquisitions in that space. And so this is a great chance for us to frankly take what we -- a business that we really know well with manufacturers that we know well and expand that into the Marine area and so that's a significant new revenue opportunity for us. In addition to these new products, we're also investing in products that are already differentiated. In 2009, we launched an earnest, what we call our financial wellness program, and this is where we go in to -- and provides financial education and financial wellness to the associates of our employers. To date, we have 125,000 employers that have allowed the BB&amp;T team to come in and describe and provide financial education, financial wellness and also discounted banking services to their associates. We continue to enhance, and you will see the timeline of enhancements that have been made, but what's most impressive is that program is now generating $6.3 billion in new deposits. 45% of which are DDA and if you look at the chart, you'll also see that the DDA balances since 2014 are growing over 14%. Now, we view this as one of our versions of a virtual bank because this is not a branch attended business. We have reps that actually go to the employees. And so this is a great platform for us to continue to expand and frankly, a great platform for us to expand outside of our branch footprint. In addition to the work that we are doing in investing in existing products or platforms that are differentiated, we can actually use existing platforms to provide a better experience for our clients. So one of the things that we're going to do, starting June 12, I am sorry February 12, is that our market leaders in the branches when they have an opportunity, finance a new vehicle, refinance a vehicle and someone comes into the branch, in the past, we've had a group that has fulfilled all types of loans for our branches, they've approved and fulfill those loans. Going forward, we're going to leverage the platform we already have an indirect auto, it's more efficient, it's more user-friendly and it's faster. And so we're going to take what has been for our branch associates and for our clients a day and a half process to close an auto loan and that now will be a 4-minute process. That's a pretty substantial improvement by leveraging a platform that frankly already exist, and we believe that we will create a whole lot more auto opportunities when we have the ability to do it in the same time that a client can drink a cup of coffee. The last thing I would mention is that new revenue opportunities are also about redirecting our existing sales team, and our largest officer level sales team in the organization is our market leader team, the folks that manage our branch network and one of the things that we believe we can use that team to do is to use our branch network to be advise centers for small businesses throughout a footprint. We know that there are over 3 million small businesses inside the market areas of our branches, and we know that in many cases and Chris described it earlier, those folks do not have CFOs, they do not have the same level of advisement that many large companies have. We believe, our market leaders can do this and so beginning of this year, we put a huge focus on them spending the majority of their time out of the branch, calling on small businesses, and you'll see, that our market leaders here are now calling on 10,000 more small businesses a week than what's taking place in the past. In addition to just being out, they're delivering our small business version of financial insights, and I'll share with you how about the opportunity to personally go on a number of those calls, and I will tell you the small businesses they're not used to having that level of feedback from a banker. And so we think that this could be a big winner for us in the future and a fantastic way for us to deploy our existing branch network. So those are just a few examples of some of the revenue opportunities that exist and so I want to talk a little bit about optimization and the things that are taking place from an optimization perspective. The number one, that I know is on everyone's mind is, what are we doing with our branch network? And you guys are aware and Chris shared the results earlier, and what we've done in '16, '17 and '18 from a branch closing perspective, and I'll tell you that we will continue that in '19. This just gives you a sense of the trajectory that we're on. And one question you may have, and I know a question that has been raised is, well, what is the optimal number? So in order to answer that question, I think it's best to understand how we determine, which of these we should close and so I wanted to share this detail with you. So for every branch in our network, we assign 2 scores. We decide a score that rates the viability of the individual branch and that is, what our transaction looks like, and where are they trending. And the most important component to this is that how is that branch doing in generating new revenue, relative to its cost. And we assign score of 1 to 5, 5 being the most viable, 1 being least viable. We also assign a market viability score. So when we look at our branches we say okay, what markets have the most opportunities for us. And so we could some poor performing branches in really good markets, and we want to be careful about closing the branches where we still have opportunity. You'll see in the graph here, the chart, that the majority of our closures are taking place in the branches where there are low market viability and also low branch viability. But this chart also informs other components of our branch strategy and so in the great markets where our branches are not performing well, that may mean, we need to relocate that branch, that may mean we need different management in that branch, a different staffing component within that branch. We allow this to really shake, how do we maximize that footprint. Now to the question of what's the optimal number? The answer to that is it's fluid. But because this metric is based on revenue versus cost, as revenue migrates to other channels then the number that are going to show up as fitting the equation and that you should close it or it's going to increase. And so this, I think gives us a rational approach to how we look at rationalizing the network. I would also say, we've been very focused on retaining clients when we close a location, and we track every vantage of closures, and you'll see the graphs here. We're very intentional about what we do with those branches. You'll see the site-selection process is very intentional, the outreach, the marketing, we work very hard to migrate the clients of those closed branches to other channels and we give them incentives to do so. And that efforts have been quite successful. As you all will see that on average, we retain 98.5% of the clients in the branch that we close. So this is a big part of what we're doing, it's significant dollars that can be applied to reinvestment and we're excited about what the future holds. I don't have time to go through all these today, but I did want to include in the slide, just a quick breakdown on opportunities that are going on in all the business units. Frankly, we have a significant opportunity in all of the high-volume consumer businesses to do a better job with consolidation, with automation, and you'll see in each of those that is in fact, taking place and then that gives us the ability to make investments. So I wanted to end the conversation by just giving you a flavor of how we're thinking about the investment component. So Kelly described earlier and used the analogy of the home that you have a home that you've lived in quite some time, and I just spent 20 minutes or so talking about that but then you have to invest in what the future home look like, and what I would describe to you over the next 3 pages, is the general outline of the blueprint of the new home. And so I wanted you all to know that in each of the business units, we've actually spent the last year, defining what that blueprint looks like, we know it will change, we know it will evolve, but how do we have a thoughtful process about making the investments necessary for the future. And so here are just a few examples for you, on the top here you see what we're doing in the auto business and it's obviously, about finding places where we can improve margins, it's about taking some of the lost volatility out of the business, it's a high-volume business. So there's a enormous opportunity for automation and taking cost out and then there's frankly revenue opportunities that we have been missing in this space. So we have a very detailed 5-year plan about how you get there. On the right-hand side, you'll see our mortgage business and it's ultimately at the end of the day about people and how do we take back market share by expanding our retail network. It's also about digital, a lot of the experience, both in the front room in the back room, that's changing the mortgage business as a result of what's happening with technology. We also know it's about data, we have $110 billion servicing book. And so how do we use the data that exist there to better execute from a mortgage perspective? So the team has spent quite a bit of time thinking about what the future of that looks like. We have the same thing going on in our card-based businesses. In our card-based businesses our products, do we have world-class products, and we just rolled out a new set, made a big difference. It's also about how do we optimize the portfolio. So how do we ensure we're top of mind for our clients and there are number of things using data that our team is doing to do that. And then ultimately, it's about that's a high-volume business, how do we optimize the business, how do we make it more effective and that is a combination of better execution and also technology. And then lastly, I would just mention to you the retail community at retail banking and what does that look like. And one of the things that we spent the last 6 months doing is actually going through a process, it's been very collaborative between myself and Donna Goodrich, Barbara Duck, Dont\u00c3\u00a1 Wilson, Bennett Bradley. A number of folks have been involved in this effort of how do we take what we believe to be the future of the retail organization and how do we deliver a blueprint for that, determine what our optimization opportunities are and then what our potential reinvestment opportunities? Now those could change, those will evolve over time, but we need to have a blueprint, we need to start making those things in earnest. And so what I provided you here, and we call that plan that we spent 6 months building: Retail, Reimagine and Reinvestment plan for short we're calling it R3. But it provides a holistic view of the things that we would want to do to evolve our platform to meet the needs of the future. It involves things like additional marketing, and we've had great success from the marketing that's taking place this year. And so how do we ramp that up? Our client care centers, how do we provide a more seamless experience to our clients using maybe larger care centers, also frankly, better technology, in queuing the calls differently. Our branch channel, Chris mentioned earlier, in our branch channel, we got to continue to evolve the experience inside the branch, but we also frankly even though we're closing branches, view branch expansion as an opportunity for us in certain markets. And so we're evaluating that and looking at where that might exist and R3 creates the opportunity for us to do that. Our digital and online account opening ability, how do we expand those but also enhance the ones we already have. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 and team and now part of the Retail Bank launched earlier this year, the Virtual Banking Center. One of the things that we know is that when you think about your retail clients, the more you engage them, whether it's through digital, whether it's through marketing or whether it's through a human, the more opportunity you're going to have with them. And the Virtual Banking Center gives us an opportunity to frankly, engage clients that may not come to a branch or may not use a care center. And then lastly, our ATM channel. We view that in the future of the ATM channel is an extension of your digital platform, having a large ATM network also gives you the ability to expand in the certain markets, and we have some significant opportunities there and a part of this plan is our ability to thoughtfully invest there. I will just close where I started. Hopefully, this gives you a quick overview of the things that we're doing as a group and the themes that are -- circulate around the actions that we're taking. I appreciate the time today, we're excited about what the future brings and excited about the trends that we're seeing from a results perspective. Thank you.</p><p>And at this time, I want to introduce David Weaver. David?</p><p>DAVID E. HUDSON WEAVER, SENIOR EVP &amp; PRESIDENT OF COMMUNITY BANKING, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: Good morning, everybody. It's great to be here, certainly, appreciate the opportunity to spend a few minutes with you this morning to update you on the number of things we're working on the Commercial Community Bank. We're very excited about the opportunity we have to continue to evolve our business so that we can continue to do a fantastic job taking care of our clients, as well as continuing to differentiate ourselves in what has become a very crowded space in the commercial banking arena and finally, finding ways to more positively deliver revenue in a very efficient productive way. What I want to touch on today there'll be a lot of things I cover but a core theme that I want you to hear, I think you've already heard a little bit about this morning, is sort of a change we're undergoing in the Commercial Bank. First, we do operate a premier model for commercial banking at BB&amp;T. It's a model that is focused on differentiation, a model that is focused on high touch, high client service, it is a model that focuses on really adding value to our clients relationships every day. We'll touch on that in just a second. But at the same time, the world is changing very, very rapidly. Our client expectations are changing, the competitive landscape is changing, and we do recognize that we have a real opportunity to continue to drive efficiencies so that we can maintain the level of quality that our clients expect. We're leveraging data, we're digitizing processes, we're changing things very, very rapidly in order to be continue to be able to deliver that premier client experience, and we're not sitting idly by, we're taking bold actions, we're moving at break neck pace and we're changing a lot of things to drive that perfect client experience. BB&amp;T, we do offer -- operate a little bit of a different model. We're organized in the 24 Community Bank regions. Our community bank regions are led by a Regional President. The Regional President is responsible for managing the commercial business but more importantly, they are the chief integrator. They pull everything together from a client perspective. You've heard that touched on a couple of different times today, but in our business, it's about local decision-making, local delivery and building those unique relationships at the client level. We do serve 155,000 clients in the commercial community bank, broken down in our small business, commercial, commercial real estate and regional corporate segments, they are outlined here from a segmentation threshold before you -- from a revenue band perspective, which give you a good idea of how we serve those clients. We do represent a good part of BB&amp;T diversification strategy. We're responsible for 23% of the revenue, 33% of the net income, and we also represent good diversification within our own space. Our portfolio, which is now about $52.5 billion at 62% C&amp;I, 38% CRE, and we have a excellent diversified deposit base, in fact, we represent a very stable and cost advantage funding source, we have about $60 billion in deposits in my group and 38% -- excuse me, 58% of those deposits are non-interest bearing. From a revenue mix perspective, we get 54% of our revenue from our deposit business, 30% of our revenue from our lending business and 16% of our revenue from our noninterest income sources. Our performance has been very solid over the last few years. Loan growth has been good on a compounded annual basis, we've been growing the portfolio of about 4%. We're very happy with that growth rate. Obviously, it's a very frothy market we take a very disciplined approach to underwriting and we've adhere to that approach through this late-blooming cycle. We've also -- we think the 4% number stacks up very well from an H8 data perspective, and we feel like we fair well against our peers. Our deposit business is growing very well, our non-interest-bearing deposits have grown 4.4%. I will tell you that has slowed a bit in recent quarters, we're still growing the non-interest-bearing deposits business, which is, we think positively differentiated from our peers many of which have begun to shrunk -- to shrink, but we're certainly continuing to grow that business. Loan production is doing well, it's up 5.7% over the last couple of years on a compounded annual basis. We are down a little bit this year and that's primarily because of our tax-exempt business has slowed pretty dramatically. We're off about a $1 billion this year in production given the tax law changes. So we're working on a number of different things, diversify our production strategy, I'll talk about that in just a second. And pre-provision net revenues are up 20% on a compounded annual basis to $1.65 billion. Revenues are up little 4.7% almost $2.7 billion, our noninterest income business is up 4.8% to $430 million. Pretax income is up 13.9%, at $1.48 billion, and our Efficiency Ratio is down nicely to slightly over 37%. We've taken about 15 percentage points out of the efficiency ratio over the last couple of years, primarily by focusing on driving revenue but also taking cost out of the model. We've taken about 225 FTEs out of the model over the last couple of years, and we do think as we focus and continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage, we have a decent run rate to continue to drive cost down and revenue up. The portfolio quality is outstanding. As you see here of past dues at the end of the third quarter, 3 basis points, our charge-offs are at 6 basis points this year. They were 6 basis points last year, 4 basis points the year before that. So we have a very, very clean portfolio and nonperforming loans are down to 57 basis points. We think we can deliver on that excellent performance, primarily by the unique and differentiated model we have in commercial banking. It's a very client-focused model first and foremost. It's all about putting the client first in everything that we do. We focus on staying very close to our clients, we focus on building great relationships with our clients. It's about local decision-making, local delivery, it's about really building on those relationships and adding value through the building of those relationships that differentiates us in the marketplace. We also run a very associate focus model, we believe in having the best bankers on the street, we believe in empowering them, we believe in giving them the best tools and resources and letting them do what they do best, which is really taking care of the client. We are community-focused model. You've heard that here the last few days. Certainly, we're focused on financial wellness. We're focusing on delivering leadership solutions through the Leadership Institute. And we take a acute focus towards rewarding the shareholders. We maintain a strong credit and risk management culture, but we're very focused on growing revenue, growing the balance sheet and certainly, managing expenses at a highly disciplined level.</p><p>But when we go to market, what we really focus on is the client, and it all starts with the client. And delivering outstanding client experience is what we're really all about. As we said, we're a relationship-oriented company. Our clients appreciate that, but it's also gotten great recognition in the marketplace from people like Greenwich. Last year, as Chris pointed out, we did receive 24 Greenwich excellence awards. Over the last 9 years, we've received 181 excellence awards in the small business and middle market space. That's more than any other bank in our peer group. We're very, very proud of that. Through this first half of this year, Greenwich has recognized us as delivering pure leading results in things like overall satisfaction, responsiveness, understanding the industry that we serve, as well as an excellent credit delivery model.</p><p>But one of the reasons we think we get the differentiated client experience level is our integrated relationship management strategy. That is the core fundamental strategy at BB&amp;T. It's not about delivering products and services to our client from that orientation, it is about building very deep relationships, where we really figure out what our clients want, what are their hopes and dreams, what do we need to do to help support them to achieve economic success and financial security. It's a model built on trust and mutual support in this, where we come together and we help them meet their needs.</p><p>We deliver that primarily through our Financial Insights tool. You've heard that mentioned. We do have a booth out front. We'd love to show you more about that, but this is really about changing the conversation with the client. We don't go to the client and try to sell them something. We go to the client, really and engage them in a very customized discovery process, where we go through and have conversations with them so that we can gain very deep understanding of their industry, of their business. It's about really drilling deeply into the financials and figuring out how we can find ways to help them grow their business. How can we challenge them to get better? We do a lot of things that, really, we think take the relationship to the next level.</p><p>One of the primary things we focus on and through the Financial Insights process is helping our clients with their leadership challenges. All of you certainly had the opportunity, or most of you did, to visit the Leadership Institute last night. We're doing great things over there. And what we've tried to do with this with our commercial clients is help our clients with leadership development, talent development, team building, change management, engagement. It's really about taking that to the next level. We think it is our duty, it is our responsibility as a partner, as a trusted adviser, to help our clients become better leaders. And to the extent that they can do that, obviously, their business thrives. We all win from that perspective. But it is a key way that we differentiate ourselves and take the conversation to the next level.</p><p>So don't just trust my word for it. I want to show you a quick video that has a few of our clients that highlights some of the impacts that we made in their lives around Financial Insights and the Leadership Institute.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DAVID E. HUDSON WEAVER: So while we're doing a lot of things really, really well, there's an opportunity to always do better. And the fact of the matter is the world has changed. It's changing very fast, and we have to change with it. It really starts from a client expectation perspective. One of the things we've been observing is client expectations are changing at a very, very rapid pace. Call it the Amazon effect. Call it whatever you want to call it, but our clients want solutions now they wanted on their time and they want world-class execution. What we're trying to do to do that is change our bank. And we've heard -- you've heard a little bit about it this morning.</p><p>Clients have also told us they want to have trusted -- have a trusted adviser. They want to have someone that challenges them. They want to have someone that is responsive and brings solutions to them. We believe that the banks that go through and do the tough things to change will be the banks that survive. We are going to rapidly change in order to meet our clients' expectations.</p><p>At the same time, we're streamlining and simplifying processes through digitization. The ease of doing business is key. It's the #1 driver of satisfaction. We're striving to be the easiest bank to do business with. We're going to give our relationship managers more tools to enable their productivity. We're going to leverage and drive that more effectively. And we're going to create better profits.</p><p>So how are we doing this? Our team came together earlier this year and put together what we're calling our Big 5 commercial plan. And it's really about driving and continuing our differentiated client experience strategies. It's about finding more productivity and efficiency in our business. It's about evolving our sales and service model. It's about using technology to support all of these things, and then finally, it's about enhancing our product offering and driving a more robust solution for our client.</p><p>So what are we doing to drive client experience? Well, first and foremost, we feel like we have to strengthen the Financial Insights tool. It is a game changer. It's changed the conversation with our clients. It's significantly differentiated us in the marketplace, but we can do a lot more. Earlier this year, we took the step of implementing robotics to enable us to certainly prepare and deliver many more of these presentations. We doubled our output from 400 to 800. We think we can do more from that perspective. But at the same time, we've got to enhance the content that goes into these solutions. We need to pull in things like news and social media. We need to pull in things like industry articles and other things to help our clients see what they need to be doing in order to be more successful.</p><p>We want to deepen the financial analysis. We want to take it to the next level. We're doing a good job today reviewing our clients' performance and how they benchmark against industry averages. But we want to take that to a best-in-class kind of an opportunity. We want to challenge our business owners to look at what their peers, their competitors are doing and really help us craft solutions in order to help them drive their business to the next level, using what-if modeling and tools, et cetera.</p><p>We want to do a better job capturing knowledge. There's a lot of information that flows out of the Financial Insights process. We want to get that embedded into our centralized Salesforce system. We want to do a better job around creating client profiles. We have a ton of data on our clients. How do we pull that together? How do we educate our bankers, prepare them more holistically for the call before they engage in these opportunities?</p><p>We want to automate recommendations. We're using AI to begin to figure out ways to drive a more consistent delivery in the Financial Insights tool, where products and services can come out of these interactions. And finally, we want to support follow-up more holistically.</p><p>At the end of the day, what we're trying to do with this is to implement robotics and AI in order to automate what has historically been a very paper, manual-based program in order to drive a better experience, in order to elevate the focus of our bankers, in order to really position us as a trusted adviser in the market place. It's a big, big opportunity.</p><p>At the same time, we want to improve our ease of doing business. As I said, we want to be the easiest bank to do business with. We've been very focused on this over the last year or so. We've really started in thinking through ways to reconceptualize our lending process.</p><p>The interesting point is, as Greenwich tells us, our lending process is very favorably perceived in the marketplace. Relatively speaking, we have one of the best experiences from a lending perspective in our peer group. But this isn't about coming from a position of weakness. It's about coming from a position of strength and really skating to where the puck is going to be. We firmly believe that you have to be the absolute best at delivery in order to be effective in this space.</p><p>So we started earlier this year with our Commercial Optimization Council. We identified 26 process improvements. We implemented those. That led to our Collaborative Laboratory process, where we put 11 cross-functional associates in a room with a objective to do 1 simple thing, and that's how to make a loan faster at BB&amp;T.</p><p>From process mapping, we realized it was taking us about 28 days to deliver an equipment loan at BB&amp;T. We challenged this group to come up with a way to make that loan in 3 days. They did that. We've implemented that. It's going extremely well. In fact, we get all kinds of positive accolades from our clients around this. We just heard a good story the other day. In the midst of the hurricane, one of our clients came to us, a tree service company in Eastern North Carolina, and said that they needed to buy new equipment in order to facilitate the cleanup of some of the hurricane damage. They applied on Monday afternoon. We closed the loan Tuesday morning. That equipment was in the field, doing work on Tuesday afternoon. That kind of responsiveness, that kind of turnaround has not been something we historically could have delivered on. So we're making great progress from that perspective.</p><p>That leads us to our end-to-end process redesign, something Chris mentioned just a moment ago. We are super excited about the opportunity that will bring us relative to driving efficiency but also, more importantly, driving a client experience that we think is -- can be unprecedented if -- when we execute on that.</p><p>It's not just about the credit process though. We're doing a lot around other aspects of our client engagements, around new account onboarding. It's around delivering treasury from an onboarding portal. It's about streamlining the account opening process. We're doing -- we're looking at everything in order to improve our client engagement and certainly, make processes better or more client friendly.</p><p>From a productivity perspective, obviously, lots of opportunity there. Certainly, fundamentally, we believe that developing and hiring and retaining the best people, giving them the best training, giving them the best tools and resources is obviously fundamental, but we also want to drive more robust activity out of our associates. We mentioned doing 800 Financial Insights a month. We're moving that to 1,250 as an objective.</p><p>Talking about client touches. We touch 1.3 clients a day. We're going to move that to 2 a day. That's 100,000 additional client touches a year.</p><p>Talk about prospecting. We have a huge opportunity to take our great story on the road. We're touching 0.5 prospects a day. We're taking that to 1 prospect a day, 75,000 additional touches annually. We firmly believe, if you believe our model, beliefs, behaviors, results, which is absolutely fundamental to who we are, driving behaviors will drive better results. Giving our bankers the tools to allow them to execute on driving those behaviors is something we're very focused on.</p><p>Certainly, leveraging our sales process is a big opportunity, adhering to our segmentation, driving and leveraging our new incentive program in a big way. We have a new revenue-based incentive model that is getting outstanding results. Our bankers are truly changing behaviors around that, which is very, very important; and then driving deeper penetration of our core commercial products. We've been able, this year, to increase our referral activity per banker by 25% and increase, at the same time, our conversion rates by 8 percentage points. So we're driving more referral activity, better quality referrals that are resulting in close business for our company, which is something we're very focused on. And by the way, we think the Financial Insights process is a big driver of that success.</p><p>Sales and service model evolution is a big deal, and we're doing a lot of work around this currently. When you think about BBT's portfolio in my space, it's a very, very granular portfolio. 78% of my clients owe us less than $1 million. So that is a very small business-oriented kind of portfolio. That's a good thing from a granularity perspective but a tough thing from a servicing perspective. And so we are reconceptualizing our small business delivery model, which is presenting a huge opportunity for us. It starts with revising segmentation. It also leads to building out a centralized sales team, providing more centralized credit support. Just, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is finding more efficient and pleasurable way for us to serve these clients. This doesn't mean our small business clients aren't important to us, quite the contrary. They're extremely important to us, but to the extent that we can serve them more efficiently, which, at the same time, will free up our bankers to move upstream to higher value clients, presents a tremendous opportunity for us.</p><p>We're also optimizing our market structures. We're looking at geography. We're looking at expanding layers. We're looking at how we use player/coaches. At the end of the day, what we're trying to do is have more bankers on the street, driving revenue, touching clients, fewer managers, fewer backroom support. So we do believe that we have a huge opportunity there to certainly leverage the resources that we do have.</p><p>At the same time, we're differentiating markets based on opportunity. If you think about our footprint, we are -- we operate very diverse markets. We are in high-growth markets like Texas and Florida. We're in slower growth markets like Eastern North Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia. And that geographic diversity presents a lot of advantages to us, and we feel very good about being in different markets. We obviously get growth out of the growth markets, but at the same time, we get stability and profitability out of some of the slower growth market. They don't boom, and they don't bust. And that's a very good thing.</p><p>But we have a tremendous opportunity, which we're very focused on, and it's migrating resources from slower growth markets into higher growth markets. As an example, in Texas, we are staffed for growth. We are -- our bankers carry smaller portfolios. They have higher call objectives. They have higher objectives around developing business, more growth. And we're getting it. We're getting double-digit growth out of those markets. In Eastern North Carolina, as an example, we have to focus on managing the book we have and staffing it accordingly and make sure we take great care of those clients and preserving those relationships but also maximizing the returns that we can get out of those markets.</p><p>Technology presents a huge opportunity for us. It's certainly a tremendous opportunity for my business as well. It really begins with building an end-to-end online platform, really a -- our clients deserve the ability to be able to self-serve in everything that they do. We're not going to migrate them to an online platform, unless they choose to do so. But having digitized onboarding is a big deal. How we online deposit -- how we onboard deposit accounts, how we onboard treasury, how we onboard the lending businesses, how we onboard many of our other products and services is a big deal. But this is also about how we use data more effectively. We have a tremendous amount of information on our clients, and to the extent that we can capture that data, leverage it and certainly use it for doing automation around recommendations and advices is a big, big deal.</p><p>We're going to leverage that primarily by taking more advantage of our Salesforce platform. We are a Salesforce-enabled company and have been for 4, 5 years. We're beginning to capture data and use that data to help us prioritize client and prospect outreach based on opportunities, based on activity, based on history, based on perceived needs. We have to -- we have 155,000 clients. We have to do a much better job of making sure that we're touching all those clients in the proper priorities.</p><p>We also want to integrate Financial Insights into the Salesforce platform. Again, the ability to harness and capture that data is a very, very powerful tool, and we're making great progress relative to that.</p><p>We got a lot going on from a product perspective as well. We're super excited about what we're rolling out in our small business and middle market space around this whole product bundle concept. What we're effectively doing, we've identified 14 industries. We're building products suites around those industries, and then we're taking advantage of that by arming our bankers not only with a world-class product offering but at the same time, leads, marketing, financial insights, the financial insights tool. And we're attacking the market.</p><p>We've started this quarter with veterinarian practices, dental practices and medical practices. We're seeing excellent response from the marketplace. We're seeing great opportunities, growth and pipeline around those opportunities. And we're going to roll out 3 more industries on each subsequent quarter until we have the whole platform launched. We're really excited about that.</p><p>We also got a lot going on from a lending perspective. We have just launched a streamlined working capital solutions operating model. We firmly believe that to be a world class C&amp;I bank, we have to be excellent at delivering asset-based lending solutions and secured finance solutions.</p><p>We launched the new model earlier this summer. We're seeing great progress there. That portfolio is growing now 15% in the back half of the year. Our goal is to double production in 2019, which we think is very achievable. We also launched our Dealer Commercial Services platform, a growth plan, earlier this year. It's been a good business for us for a number of years, but we really have seen that escalate this year under this growth plan, a 59% increase in production. We're growing that business double digits nicely 16%, 17%. We think that has good runway as we move forward.</p><p>We've expanded our SBA lending program. Production's up 33%, and we've leveraged our single-family platform in a number of growth markets, and we're seeing that portfolio grow nicely after many years of decline.</p><p>The deposit business is doing really well. I showed you some of the statistics around that. We do have an opportunity and are rolling out a new product offering in the first part of the year, which, we think, will fill a void and fill a gap. So we're really looking at maintaining the momentum we have in the non-interest-bearing production -- from a non-interest-bearing production perspective, and we're going to make sure we keep that momentum as we move forward.</p><p>We also are really excited about some of the opportunities we have in the treasury space. '19 is a big product launch year for us. We have our cash manager online platform being revamped. We have a single sign-on portal on the docket. We're going to finish the journey on real-time payments. There's a lot going on from a treasury perspective, and I tell you, I'm super excited with the recent alignment of treasury and commercial deposits and association services within the community bank commercial area. We're going to do great things from a deposit perspective, and we're going to continue to drive that forward very positively.</p><p>So we do feel like, in the community bank, we are well positioned to evolve to grow, and we do think that driving performance is a big element of our focus. We've made good progress. We've got a long way to go, and we're really excited about the opportunity. At a real fundamental level, however, it's about people, process and product.</p><p>But we think there's 4 things that we need to stay focused on in order to -- for us to execute on our mission. First and foremost, we got to maintain and build strong client relationships. Our clients are key, and to the extent that we can do a great job continuing to take care of them, to the extent that we can bring in new clients, tell our story in the marketplace and aggressively focus on business development, we think we will be successful. In order to be successful at doing that, however, we got to continue to find ways to add value through differentiation. Differentiation's very, very important in our space. Obviously, our products are not largely different from the next banks, and so how we present ourselves, how we go to market, how we add value to our clients is a big, big deal, and we're very focused on that.</p><p>We're going to obviously continue to invest in the business. We're going to continue to evolve the business. It's a big opportunity. And finally and probably most importantly, we're going to find ways to improve processes through streamlining structure. I cannot speak to this, how important this is for us, to the extent that we find opportunities to continue to leverage what we're doing, to expand the offerings that we're making every day and doing in a more efficient and holistic way is a big, big opportunity for us.</p><p>So if we do these 4 things, we are very, very confident that we will continue to drive the financial results in a very positive way that I showed you before. So thank you all very much. Enjoy the rest of your stay. We look forward to engaging with you at the breaks and lunch.</p><p>Take care.</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: At this time, we're going to have our morning break. The exhibits are open and the restrooms, as you leave the auditorium, are to your right. Refreshments are outside and available for you, and we're going to begin promptly at 10:15 a.m. so a little over 35 minutes. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>WILLIAM RUFUS YATES, SENIOR EXECUTIVE VP, MANAGER, DIRECTOR, CEO OF BB&amp;T SECURITIES AND PRESIDENT OF BB&amp;T SECURITIES, BB&amp;T CAPITAL MARKETS INC.: Thank you for spending your day with us. I mean, if you think about, where else can you spend a day hearing about the success and growth of one of the country's finest financial services company and also get a turkey call?</p><p>So for those of you who picked up your turkey call or if you haven't, I'm sure you will, let me give you an additional forward-looking disclosure. If you're counting on that for next Thursday, you better not wait until Wednesday to try it. So I would say jump on it quickly.</p><p>I'm Rufus Yates. I manage the Financial Services and Commercial Finance businesses for BB&amp;T. And I really want to go over with you the differentiating products and services that we incorporate in this group of companies to serve our clients, both supporting branch retail initiatives, David's commercial and regional corporate initiatives and our own large corporate and institutional platform.</p><p>There's 4 real takeaways on these -- this segment. One revenue growth, you'll see a lot of diversified fee income that comes from managing client-invested assets. You'll see asset diversification. We have meaningful C&amp;I books of business that both bring us industry expertise and diversification as well as geographic diversification. And then we've got bankers scattered now all over the country realizing the advantages of diversified books.</p><p>We also support through our Wealth segment growing really high-quality retail relationships. And our industry expertise is a core differentiator for us. In a world of financial sameness, what do you really do to differentiate our service proposition, our value offering from the competitors? You've got to have insightful focused advice to give clients, but at the end of the day, it's about helping our clients achieve economic success and financial security.</p><p>Now I'll tell you, we are focused and diligent about that. We spend a tremendous amount of time consulting with our partners in the community in commercial and corporate bank to make sure the team members that this group represents come in and really add material value to those clients, helping them through some -- often some of the most strategic decisions that they have to make. From a wealth client, they come in and unpack their entire financial life to our wealth advisers, and then we provide them growth and management opportunities. Commercial and corporate, whether a strategic transaction that might lead to an M&amp;A deal or restructuring a balance sheet, these partners really do add significant value.</p><p>17% of revenues, 17% of pretax income, really split between 2 different service delivery channels. The wealth, retirement businesses really are core -- relationship managers building client invested assets. At the bottom of the service proposition there is helping clients really grow their personal corporate and institutional wealth. On the capital markets corporate banking and equipment finance side is about structuring the balance sheet, is about bringing the power of BB&amp;T's balance sheet to these clients and also taking them to the public and private markets when they're looking for that level of execution.</p><p>In 2014, when I talked to you about our strategies, one of the key initiatives for us was building a national distribution franchise. We've done it, and we've done it through putting our bankers in residence in important markets, whether it's New York, Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, L.A. You see on this map the diversification that we have -- now we offer the market. You also see our corporate banking platform today. 40% of our client assets are outside of our core retail franchise. Our equipment finance business, 44% of our book of business is outside of our core franchise. So you see we really have brought diversification.</p><p>Growth, meaningful growth opportunity in this business, growing revenues at about 4%. And you see the pretax contribution here at about 18%. There's a little bit of a disconnect with that 18%, and let me tell you why. If you look at the bottom left up here, you see our nonperforming loans in 2016 at 37 basis points, still a reasonable number. But that's when the oil and gas portfolio, the industry really was realizing its most stress point, so we increased appropriately our reserves for that. But you see that portfolio performed extremely well, and you see the following year we released those reserves as that portfolio sort of healed itself from a pricing standpoint. So that was really just a dislocation in performance. When you take the provision adjustment out of pretax income, growing pretax income in about 5.5%. So you see nice positive operating leverage and a very stable 36%, 37% margin in these businesses.</p><p>One of the drivers of growth, our Wealth book. Our wealth partners today are growing their outstandings at about 20%. You see the advisory work that we do, whether it's securities secured in partnership with our brokerage network or our home equity loan products or our unsecured products, very meaningful growth with Wealth.</p><p>Corporate is growing at about a 5.6% growth. You see the commitments at $40 billion, revolver commitments are driving fee growth for this segments. So you see nice growth in outstandings, but you also get a nice lift in fee growth as we grow those commitments.</p><p>Equipment and governmental finance growing at about 8%; and Grandbridge, our commercial real estate mortgage banking and brokerage business, growing at about 17%. Today, we offer a balance sheet solution for our high-quality commercial real estate developers, where we can underwrite to the permanent market standard and provide them balance sheet solutions because many of these clients will have projects that they're up-fitting or aggregating with other parcels of property, and they may want some prepayment flexibility. So underwritten to national market standards with a balance sheet solution for high quality -- often reissuers, they'll come in and then these are existing clients both regionally and nationally that we continue to serve.</p><p>Growing invested assets, very important to our overall proposition here. You see we stand today at about $168 billion in client invested assets, growing at 9.3%. We're also growing the fee contribution of offering those clients those investment solutions. You see at $652 million growing at 8.5%. So today, we are growing assets in our advisory roles, and we're growing a annuitized fee income stream because of that.</p><p>The very bottom, you see the key point here. Today, about 81% of our invested income is fee based, not commission based, which gives us a very nice stream of predictable earnings off of those assets.</p><p>Wealth. Our Wealth business really is a combination of our advisory business, which is our investment solutions that we offer through the banking network, BB&amp;T Investments, our full-service brokerage platform, Scott &amp; Stringfellow, partnered with their wealth advisers and in conjunction with our retirement, institutional and trust platform, providing clients retirement planning, asset management and growth opportunities, supplemented by Sterling Capital, which is our asset management platform, where our mutual fund complex is housed and where we provide investment advisory solutions to our own clients and also to distribution powers -- distribution platforms across the country. Today, this is annualizing at about a $1 billion platform, $165 billion in assets, 215,000 clients served by 2,000 licensed associates. So a point we would want you to really reflect on is, today, we really are a powerhouse investment management business.</p><p>If you think about how we segment, this just gives you sort of the spray of how we serve these clients.</p><p>The mass affluent clients building more of a digital solution, self-service, we are spending a lot of time with our digital partners enhancing that solution. The affluent, the $500,000 to $2 million, really those clients are being served through centers of excellence that are centrally located, served by regional advisers.</p><p>And then you get to the more customized solutions through our high network and of course, our institutional platform.</p><p>Full complement of products and services. There are no gaps today in the service delivery system that we have there.</p><p>When you think about how do we differentiate from a wealth perspective, we have a planning centric business model. We bring clients in individually and go through personal financial plans with them. We fully believe every client should have a financial plan.</p><p>When we do that, they then bring the whole power of the integrated bank to play. They bring both the BB&amp;T Securities financial advisers, the capital markets solutions, maybe it's a strategic M&amp;A transaction, commercial banking in the Community Bank, when we deal with private client in the C suite and the owners of those companies, we're able to go in and do a personal plan, while David's team is doing a strategic plan, Financial Insights plan, for the business.</p><p>Our life insurance partners. Insurance is a core component of financial planning. We have strong partnerships with our insurance partners to provide financial advice there.</p><p>What's the opportunity really look like for us? Forrester did a survey. There's a 126 -- approximately 126,000 retail households in the country. Forrester surveyed them to see how do they segment from the way we deliver our business.</p><p>You see the mass affluent segment here on the left. Forrester suggests 26% of retail households would fit this $100,000 to $500,000 investable assets.</p><p>Today, we serve 120,000 of those clients in our own house. We know there's 320,000 that we've identified and profiled so we're serving only about 40% of what we know.</p><p>If we look at Forrester's guidance, it would suggest there's 1.3 million clients today in BB&amp;T's system where if we can identify where their assets are, we can be their mass affluent adviser.</p><p>Looking at core in the middle, this is where we really built our Wealth platform. Today, you see we're serving 76% of our known clients. Using Forrester's research would suggest there's 300,000 of those clients, that we're only serving 26% of the potential.</p><p>Now these aren't clients that we've got to go into the market and find. These are clients who are already customers of BB&amp;T. We just need to bring their assets in the house.</p><p>And the ultrahigh net worth the 5 -- the $25 million and greater, we have a very high penetration rate, 95% of the known clients. Forrester would suggest there's another 3,000 of those out there.</p><p>So the opportunity is here. The opportunity is meaningful, and the clients today are seeing great value from the advice that we're providing.</p><p>What are we going to do to grow this business? Improve the client experience. You're going to hear a lot more about our digital transformation. We're enhancing our products and solutions. We're bringing greater tools to our associates, and we're expanding the business model.</p><p>Looking at our digital platform, the U platform. Today our clients go in, manage their financial lives. For the Wealth segment, we really want to create a portal where you will go in and see your entire financial life. You'll have your financial plan embedded through the U portal.</p><p>You'll be able to bring all of your other financial assets that are held in other institutions, aggregate them on your desktop and see your full life. You'll be able to handle all of your payments. You'll have a document vault, where you'll put all of your important papers.</p><p>In other words, the Wealth client will have a holistic financial experience. They will come to BB&amp;T site to see every aspect of their life. Bringing our trust and brokerage platforms closer together, making it seamless to our trust clients and our brokerage and advisory clients. When they're using both products, we'll be able to move, transport and see performance reporting in a consistent way.</p><p>Digital advice, building a digital-supported solutions with advisers. You hear the term robo a lot. We want digital-assisted advice. We are building the infrastructure to be able to bring early-stage investors into this channel, but we're also going to make absolutely certain the client will always have the opportunity to opt into a higher level or higher touch advice.</p><p>We've enhanced our wealth lending capabilities in direct partnership with the Community Bank to build the tools, the products, the services that meet the unique borrowing needs of the Wealth client.</p><p>Robotics, chat enablement, all of the things that you will hear us talk about for the commercial and retail systems will also be very important differentiators for us on the Wealth side.</p><p>Adviser mobility. This is a big issue for us. Giving our associates the ability to transact with their clients where they are to be able to take the financial planning tools that we provide and put them and allow our associates to have digital-enabled tablets, so they will be able to sit down and manage client relationships remotely with them.</p><p>Client communications. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 is working very closely with us as we uptier our Financial Insights and our Perspectives communications, sending targeted information to client about issues that matter to them, particularly in the Wealth segment, where there's transaction issues around economic cycles, around industry issues.</p><p>We're going to deliver solutions electronically that way. So building those early-stage client investors is very important.</p><p>Helping clients get started on the dream journey of building their wealth, working through our central -- centrally located adviser channel. We've now initiated and stood up a retirement resource center, so that there is a place to go inside the organization for clients and associates to be able to learn more about how to manage their retirement needs. And expanding in core markets. You will see us opening jointly Wealth offices that have brokerage and full-service advisory in partnership.</p><p>Now as we have built this business, I thought you might find it interesting to really hear a client experience. And so I'm going -- I look forward to sharing with you one of our client's journey.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>WILLIAM RUFUS YATES: It's a great example of how our advisory business partners with the various parts of the financial services group to bring the value proposition to life. This company was built, we advise on the banking side. When it was ready for a strategic decision, we took them to market, and then we manage the wealth on the other side. And as it expands and grows other business, we will be its bank.</p><p>Now moving to the corporate and institutional business for us. Our driver here is to really become more meaningful provider of solutions to clients as we grow our balance sheet commitment.</p><p>As we uptier in the corporate and institutional platform, we're able to earn the right to provide fee-based services and solutions.</p><p>Today, $672 million year-to-date, and it's tracking to about a $900 million company.</p><p>36% of our C&amp;I book is represented with this part of our business, 14% of our commercial deposits at $9 billion. And all driven by 3,000 clients, served by 677 associates.</p><p>So a high yield when you bring these relationships into the organization.</p><p>Full service financial delivery today. There is not a product gap with this group when we bring and we represent BB&amp;T as a corporate partner. We can bring every capital solution that they might need.</p><p>Our leading fee-based partners, insurance, you're going to hear a lot from John about the build out there, treasury, capital market, access to the debt markets as well. The Leadership Institute's a real differentiator for this group.</p><p>And then as you think about the partnership with corporate, our equipment finance businesses today. When we look at our equipment -- our large ticket leasing business, about 65% overlap with our corporate book. So we've really brought those businesses together and aligned them in a common distribution platform, giving us a great amount of leverage.</p><p>Where do we really grow this C&amp;I book? And how does it offer industry diversification? Today, retail's about 17% of our portfolio. Retail, for us, if you think about it, is really driven by our supply chain, finance business, our automotive aftermarket. It's driven by our food, beverage and ag businesses.</p><p>This is not big box retail. This isn't retail competing with Amazon. This is distribution companies, where there is food or drug or the other zones types of the world.</p><p>Financial services, driven really by our exposure to high-grade public REIT. Health care, 3% of our portfolio, but the majority of our health care in senior living support here and educational support is done in partnership with David and Brant and the Community Bank. So the portfolio really resides there.</p><p>Our industrial platform is sort of the core part of the business for us. 35% is smokestack America. People who make things, extruders, aggregate managers, energy, for us, upstream E&amp;P, producing, performing upstream clients, and then our high-grade utility business would fit there as well.</p><p>The segment that we're underrepresented in really is the business services and technology. So we started an initiative to really learn more about that business. We brought associates on, on the West Coast, who were really guiding us through a process of looking at where we can introduce our financial service solutions to that part of the business.</p><p>Today, we participate on the distribution side, but we'll be spending more time going forward looking at all aspects of technology and business services.</p><p>So what have we done to the balance sheet? What have we done to our commitments as we've gone through this? This graph, let me -- I'll just try to explain that the hash line here is BB&amp;T's peer -- it's our allocation in shared national credit. It's where our average would be.</p><p>So the far right-hand side, we today fit in, year-to-date 2018, our average commitment and a shared national credit is about $54 million. This compares us to the peers who participate in the same transactions. So the point that I would make here is we've got great opportunity to continue to grow our participation in these large corporate deals without outsizing the organization in comparison to our peers.</p><p>Now this does not include JPMorgan, Wells Fargo. This is really regional competitors. So at our $54 million -- you see the highest. You would see the 8 -- $90 million and $100 million. So we're still tracking in the bottom 1/3 of aggregate commitment. So conservative, well-managed credit culture with meaningful opportunity to grow there.</p><p>What have we done with our national coverage? I mentioned that we were expanding our reach nationally with our loan production offices.</p><p>Today, we're seeing our LPO strategy generate about 13% to 14% year-over-year growth. A disproportionate amount of our net new clients are coming from clients outside of the core bank-branded franchise.</p><p>So this chart just shows you clients greater than $500 million in revenue, what's our share of the client book? How many clients would we know? This suggests a little less than 10% on the West Coast, are clients of ours. Huge growth potential today with the over 500 segments there.</p><p>And this just traffics across how we quadrant the country and how we cover. It would suggest there's opportunity in every market. What's optimal for us here would really traffic more towards the 30% to 40%. A large portion, the remainder, would be clients who've either structure or pricing would not be attractive to us or maybe an industry that we wouldn't land into.</p><p>So meaningful opportunity for continued growth as we expand this national coverage. We've expanded our San Francisco, Denver and Texas platforms with recent hires. We're bringing in high-quality bankers, who have experience in their markets that can introduce us to net new clients. And our -- BB&amp;T's balance sheet is a very attractive partner for these clients so we're getting nice uptier lift from those.</p><p>You see that our focus on technology, using the new team that we've brought in on the West Coast to really look at that segment that will cover the country nationally with that group and our opportunity to continue to uptier existing relationships.</p><p>Today, this business represents -- about 40% of their income comes from the fee opportunity that's driven off of these credit commitments.</p><p>We'd love to see that percentage rate increase, and we think it can as we become more strategically important to these clients as a credit provider, we will be rewarded with higher participation rate on the fee side.</p><p>And this is just a quick example of how that works. Ryder System, a transportation, logistics company, asset-based company. We materially increased our credit commitment to Ryder, and then we were rewarded after that commitment with the ability to come in and provide an M&amp;A advisory solution for them. So we had a successful M&amp;A transaction. We then were invited to participate in their public debt issuance.</p><p>We've now done 4 transactions with Ryder since increasing our credit commitment, and now we've engaged our equipment leasing team to be a more meaningful provider of equipment finance solutions for Ryder.</p><p>So as we uptier, it brings the whole value proposition to a much higher contribution level with these clients. So were very pleased with the success that we've had as we've grown these clients nationally.</p><p>So that brings me back to sort of where we started. Diversification around revenue, fee income driven from growing clients' invested assets, asset diversification through industry-focused C&amp;I lending, geographic diversification through the opposites that we have from New York and Boston now through San Francisco and L.A.</p><p>The national platform has been successful, 40% of the C&amp;I book today in the corporate arena outside of the franchise, still meaningful room to grow. You saw our penetration rate. We've got the ability to materially uptier and increase our client count in those markets, wealth -- high-value proposition for retail, bringing those wealth clients in, providing the full-service financial advisory, incorporating our trust powers and building the ability to serve those clients through generational wealth transfer really is a differentiator.</p><p>And it allows us to not only serve those who are growing their wealth but those who are in a position now to think about distributing their wealth.</p><p>Philanthropic services, which is part of our institutional services platform, allowing clients to give back to the communities that have empowered them to grow their wealth.</p><p>And then industry-specific solutions. Again, a diversification key for us is do you bring intellectual advice to the table that makes you look different in a world of financial sameness to our client base.</p><p>And we do that through the expertise of our industry teams and our targeted marketing strategies. So we're very pleased with the growth that we've had in this business, and we think it positions us nicely for continued growth for the future.</p><p>Now I'm very pleased to introduce John Howard, who's going to talk about our insurance capabilities.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>JOHN MICHAEL HOWARD, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BB&amp;T INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.: Good morning. That video is a good example of the importance of what we do. Within insurance, we're currently helping more than 5,000 of our clients recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael.</p><p>When I think of the vision of BB&amp;T and making the world a better place to live, that's a vision that we execute on every day because insurance is helping people and companies protect against economic loss.</p><p>It's a risk transfer mechanism that allows them to invest and grow and contribute to our overall economy. Insurance is a business that has a history that goes back to biblical times. There were benevolent societies that would help people recover from economic loss. Since then, the industry has evolved tremendously.</p><p>I think you would probably agree with me that we live in a world today that presents ever-increasing risk.</p><p>When I think about the way that we have developed properties. We continue to develop properties along the coasts. We continue to develop properties in low-lying flood-prone areas. We develop properties in more remote and rural areas. So when we have occurrences like hurricanes, there is much greater exposure, same with floods, same with the forest fires that we're hearing about in California as we stand here today.</p><p>So that risk is greater than it ever has been before. Of course, it's aggravated by climate change. If you think of the past 8 years in the United States, we've had 12 1,000-year flood events. If you think of Houston, in just the past 3 years, we've had 3 500-year flood events. So there's a tremendous amount of risk that we're able to help protect. That's only in property. If you take a minute and step back and think about casualty, think about the cyber exposure that exists today, that continues to expand every year.</p><p>Industry estimates are that more than 90% of that cyber risk is uninsured today. Presents a tremendous opportunity for us to help our clients. If you think about other types of risks that are emerging, whether you think of the Me Too movement or you think of active shooters or you think of workplace violence, all horrific events, all big risks, all things that we can help our clients protect against.</p><p>When I go through my presentation today, I hope there are at least 4 things that you'll take away from it. The first is that BB&amp;T Insurance Holdings is the fifth largest insurance broker in the world. It's a very unique business. The second is that we have favorable market conditions today. For several years, we've had headwinds that we've had to overcome. Right now, we have tailwinds. And then third, we have a transformation underway. This is resilient business, and we are working very hard to improve the earnings trajectory from it. And then fourth, this is a client-first business. We are very, very focused on providing world-class advisory services to our clients, and that gives us a great growth trajectory in future years.</p><p>If you look at BB&amp;T Insurance Holdings, I think one of the things that's important to recognize is we're not an insurance carrier. I titled this presentation not so risky business, one, because I thought it was a neat play on words; but two, because I wanted to make it very clear, we're not an insurance carrier. We are not responsible for paying claims. We don't have that risk on our balance sheet. We are an adviser. We are consultants. We work with our clients to help them understand the risks that they have, some of which they may not even realize.</p><p>And then we help them design insurance programs to address those risks. We help them place those insurance programs with insurance carriers, and then we help our clients manage the overall cost of that risk.</p><p>And in the case that they have a loss, a covered loss, a valid claim, we advocate on their behalf to ensure that those claims are played -- paid correctly.</p><p>So when you think about this business, I think of it as an income statement business, not as a balance sheet business. The commission and fee business. It's a business that has a 96-year history, going back to 1922. BB&amp;T began in insurance a long time ago. We've actually acquired businesses that have even longer histories than that.</p><p>This year, we'll place $26 billion in insurance premium, that represents trillions of dollars of insurance coverage for our clients. So you'll see we're the fifth largest broker in the world.</p><p>One of the unique aspects of our platform is due to our ownership by BB&amp;T, we have permanent capital behind us. The private equity industry considers insurance brokers to be very attractive properties and has a 20-year history of investing in insurance brokers and rolling up insurance brokers.</p><p>Chris mentioned earlier that I joined BB&amp;T 6.5 years ago when BB&amp;T acquired the company that I led. That was a company that was sponsored by private equity firms. So I am in a position to have first-hand experience and know that with private equity ownership, it's not permanent capital. It's temporary capital.</p><p>With permanent capital, we're able to provide assurance to our associates and assurance to our clients that we're committed to this business, and they know what the ownership is going to be of the business, and they know of our wherewithal to invest throughout the cycle. It's a really big advantage in our industry.</p><p>Our culture is focused on our clients. You've heard it from BB&amp;T. It is very true in BB&amp;T Insurance. It is a client-first mentality.</p><p>We have very strong relationships with the largest insurance companies in the world. And if you look at BB&amp;T Insurance Holdings, we have 230 offices across the United States and about 7,500 employees.</p><p>What do we do? Well, we go-to-market through 3 main verticals. So the first is retail. Retail is work -- where we work directly with the purchaser of insurance. So we are advising that purchaser on their risks, on what insurance coverage is available to address those risks. How they should design an insurance program, how we can place that program, and then how we can lower their cost of insurance and ensure that claims are paid.</p><p>Within our retail business, we have 2 major components today, McGriff Insurance Services and McGriff Seibels &amp; Williams.</p><p>McGriff Insurance Services is the combination of what we call BB&amp;T Insurance Services and Regions Insurance Group. In early April this year, we announced that we were acquiring Regions Insurance Group. We closed on that acquisition at the beginning of July. I should mention that last weekend, we completed our wholesale system conversions. Conversions went smoothly. And the weekend prior to that, so 2 weekends ago, we completed our retail system conversions. Those conversions also went smoothly.</p><p>With the Regions Insurance Group acquisition, one of the most important things was ensuring that we retain the key talent with that acquisition. And I'm pleased to report that we've retained 99.5% of the key individuals from the transaction. So as a result of retaining the key people, having a good plan, having smooth conversions, we've been able to outperform our acquisition model for that business.</p><p>One of the key dynamics was, of course, Regions Bank and BB&amp;T Bank are competitors, so Regions had some concerns about selling their insurance business to a competitor. One of the ways that we address that concern was by saying that we would rebrand the business, that we wouldn't brand it BB&amp;T, which is how we came up with the McGriff Insurance Services name for the combination of BB&amp;T Insurance Services and Regions Insurance Group.</p><p>It's building off of a fantastic retail brand that we have in McGriff Seibels &amp; Williams.</p><p>McGriff is known throughout the insurance industry. It's highly respected, highly regarded. And this was an opportunity for us to leverage that brand. Another advantage to the branding strategy is it creates better separation between our retail businesses and our wholesale businesses.</p><p>I'll describe our wholesale business in more detail in just a minute, but the thought I'd like you to retain is that our retail business is a customer of our wholesale business, and competitors of our retail business are customers of our wholesale business. So naturally it's advantageous to create more separation from a branding standpoint between those businesses.</p><p>Within retail, McGriff Insurance Services deals more with what I would consider mid-market clients. Certainly, personalized clients, small business clients, but also midsized commercial accounts.</p><p>It is a regional platform, so it is strong from the Mid-Atlantic through the Southeast into the Midwest, and then we have a good presence in California as well.</p><p>But McGriff Insurance Services isn't a national platform today. McGriff Seibels &amp; Williams is a national platform, and it focuses on serving larger-sized commercial accounts. So more complicated risks, more complicated placements.</p><p>Shifting over to our wholesale division. Wholesale insurance is a business that is designed to support difficult placements for retail insurance brokers.</p><p>Retail insurance brokers on a daily basis are out prospecting and building and developing relationships, and they can't be experts in every risk category and every insurance carrier in the marketplace.</p><p>What our wholesale business does is it develops very strong relationships with retail insurance brokers and then provides the expertise that they need for difficult placements to serve their clients.</p><p>Our wholesale insurance business is broken up into 3 components. CRC is the second largest wholesale property and casualty broker in the country. AmRisc is the largest provider of wind coverage for hurricane-exposed properties, and Crump Life is the largest wholesale distributor of life insurance and related products.</p><p>When you think about the geographic coverage of those businesses, CRC is a national platform, AmRisc, since it's providing coverage for hurricane-exposed properties, is really a southeastern platform, and Crump Life is a national platform.</p><p>Then the third component of our segment, Insurance Holdings and Premium Finance, is premium finance. But we have about 25% market share, so we're clearly an industry leader. And with premium finance, what we do is we provide a vehicle for companies to pay their insurance premiums and not to have to pay them all at one time, so they are able to finance those premium payments.</p><p>We're able to build it into many of our quoting processes so that it is an easy path and an easy alternative for our clients to use.</p><p>So when I think of these businesses, I think that there's a lot of synergy that comes from having a really strong retail business, that works with a really strong wholesale business, that work with a really strong premium finance business. That is a unique combination.</p><p>When you think about our contribution to BB&amp;T Corporation, we're one of the 4 segments that BB&amp;T reports externally. On a year-to-date basis, we're 16% of BB&amp;T's revenue. We're 7% of BB&amp;T's net income. So when I talk about the transformation that we're going through and our focus on improving profitability, this slide highlights the opportunity that we have.</p><p>When you look at our peer group, we're the fifth largest insurance broker in the world. The 6 largest insurance brokers in the world are all public companies. When you look at those public companies, they trade at multiples that are quite a bit higher than the multiples that banks trade at today.</p><p>So when I look at Insurance Holdings within BB&amp;T, I think of it as a hidden gem that BB&amp;T shareholders own at a multiple that is favorable to the multiples that our peers trade at.</p><p>Then when you go down the list, if you look at USI and HUB, those are private equity-backed brokers. And as you go even further down the list, you see more and more private equity-backed brokers. So when I think about our position in the marketplace, I've already said the advantages that I believe we have from permanent capital. I also believe that we have significant advantages from the overall scale of BB&amp;T and the resources that it can provide, and I'll go into those in more detail in a few minutes.</p><p>I commented on how we have a unique combination of businesses. When you think about the large retail organizations on this platform, they don't have wholesale components in the United States.</p><p>In fact, Marsh's wholesale broker, they sold a few years ago, we own. Aon wholesale broker, they sold a few years ago, we own. Willis' wholesale broker, they sold a few years ago and is one of our primary competitors.</p><p>Arthur J. Gallagher has a wholesale broker but is a much smaller portion of their overall insurance brokerage business.</p><p>Brown &amp; Brown, the same is true. They own a wholesale broker, but it's a much smaller portion of their overall business.</p><p>So when you look at having roughly a 50-50 balance between retail and the wholesale insurance brokerage, we truly are unique. Another thing that is a unique characteristic of our business is our growth organically and our growth through acquisitions.</p><p>If you go back 15 years to 2003, this is a business that was about $400 million in revenue. Now we're pretty close to $2 billion in revenue. So over the past 15 years, we've grown more than 500%. And then if you just go to a more recent time frame, if you go back to 2011 until today, we've more than doubled in size over that period of time, a lot of it through organic growth, some of it through acquisitions. We've done our 4 largest acquisitions over that time frame as well. And when I think of those acquisitions, every one of them has been very successful. So the Crump group acquisition that I mentioned earlier, we were able to combine with other businesses that BB&amp;T owned previously to create this powerhouse wholesale platform that I mentioned.</p><p>And then you see in 2016, we were able to complement that by buying Swett &amp; Crawford to really create a wholesale powerhouse. With the Regions acquisition in 2018, we had a catalyst for our retail insurance business that puts us on a path for transformation there. And if you look at the American Coastal sale that Chris mentioned earlier, it was about $140 million in revenue that we're taking out of revenue even as we're showing this very significant growth.</p><p>And it gave us increased ownership in AmRisc, which is a best-in-class underwriting platform, underwriting on behalf of 10 leading insurance companies because of the expertise that we have in underwriting wind risk for hurricane-exposed properties. That is an income statement business. So it is a high-margin, high-growth vehicle, especially when you look at the frequency of storms exhibited recently, as recent as this year as well as last year.</p><p>So when you think of this growth rate, I think that it puts us on a wonderful path because we've been able to have a great history of organic growth as well as growth through acquisitions. We've acquired more than 100 businesses. And I mentioned with Regions, we retained more than 99.5% of the key associates. With Swett &amp; Crawford, we retained 99% of the key associates. With the AmRisc American Coastal transaction, it was a 100%. With the Crump transaction, it was more than 95%. Those were best-in-class numbers for our industry. This is something that we are really good at.</p><p>When you think about the diversification that we provide to BB&amp;T Corporation, in 2007, we were 13% of BB&amp;T's revenue. Today, we're 16%. I'm hopeful that we'll be an even more significant contributor in the years to come. And then if you think about the diversification of our business, in 2007, our wholesale business was only 30% of our insurance brokerage revenue. So our retail business was considerably more than half of -- I'm sorry, considerably more than double what our wholesale business was. Today, you see that our wholesale business is about half, so it's grown significantly. And you see that we're better diversified across product categories. If you go back to 2007, we didn't even have life insurance. And today, life insurance is 10% of our product mix. So we've actively managed the diversification of this platform as we've grown it organically and grown it through acquisitions. When I talk about being a resilient business, a big part of why this is a resilient business is because we are so well diversified, uniquely diversified in our industry.</p><p>When you look at our capabilities, they're very broad. The specialties and practice groups that I list across the top of this slide are examples. They aren't the only ones that we do, but I wanted you to be able to picture the types of clients that we serve. We have expertise in these industry verticals so that we're able to truly advise those clients on the risks that they may or may not be aware of, and how they can effectively address those risks. We have very broad product capabilities that you see in the boxes across the middle of this page. Often, when I talk to people in an introductory meeting, they'll say, \"What kind of insurance do you do? Do you do life insurance?\" Yes. \"Do you do property insurance?\" Yes. \"Do you do casualty insurance?\" Yes. \"Do you do health insurance?\" Yes. \"Do you do title insurance?\" Yes. \"Do you do personal life insurance?\" Yes. We have very, very broad capabilities. And then another thing that positions us uniquely in our industry is the breadth of clients that we serve. So everything from individuals, all the way up to the largest, most sophisticated companies, that isn't common in our industry. Within our industry, firms tend to specialize within a certain type of clients. Having such a broad client set is another contributor to that resiliency that I mentioned.</p><p>If you look at our contribution to BB&amp;T. When we showed the video and commented about the more than 5,000 clients that we're helping recover from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, I think that's one example of our contribution to BB&amp;T because we're helping to make the world a better place to live. But if you look at statistics, we help by providing income diversification to BB&amp;T. We're not exposed to the same credit cycle as BB&amp;T's lending businesses. We're not exposed to the same interest rate cycle as BB&amp;T's other businesses. So we provide a nice hedge and a nice balance. We're in an area of growth. When you look at the insurance business cycle, I'll give you more information on that in a minute, but we can perform well in scenarios where lending businesses don't perform well. This is an income statement business. It's not a balance sheet business. So we have very limited capital requirements.</p><p>And then when you look at our product offerings, we are able to help. You've heard in Rufus' comments and Brant's comments and David's comments about the complementary nature of our businesses. All of their clients buy insurance somewhere. We can make it easier for them to purchase insurance. Very few people that I talked to say, \"Hey, I'm really looking forward to going out and buying insurance.\" To the extent that we can make that process easier and that we can provide excellent support and service to them, it's a real value add and it's a real demonstration of our client-first mentality. When I think about our new business within our Retail segment for insurance, approximately 25% of that comes through BB&amp;T's Integrated Relationship Management program. That's leveraging the relationships that BB&amp;T has across the enterprise.</p><p>Comment about the insurance industry cycle for a few minutes. The first thing that I'd point out to you is it's different than the interest rate cycle, it's different than the credit cycle. What's it's largely related to are insurance loss scenarios because it's basic economics. Supply and demand. There are reinsurance companies and insurance companies that have capital. When they have an abundance of capital, they're competing with each other. To underwrite risks, it causes the price of that underwriting to decline. When capital is eroded through losses, that means there is less of it, it means that there's less competition for new business and prices tend to rise. So if you go back historically, you see a very good example of a hard market in the early 2000s. And in the insurance, we tend to refer to markets as being hard or soft. When you think about the peak of that, look at the amplitude. It was very significant. You had better than 30% price increases. And then look at the duration of it. You had a multiyear period of time that you were in hard market scenario. And then you went through a soft market. Again, look at the bottoms of those trials and look at how long they lasted. One of the things that, I think, is a major change in insurance is what's happened with the insurance business cycle. When you think of hard and soft markets, they don't have the amplitudes that they had before. They don't go up as much and they don't go down as much. They also don't last as long. The reason for that is there's other capital that is flowing into the insurance industry. Some people call it alternative capital, some call it convergence capital. It comes from a variety of sources. Sometimes it's hedge funds, sometimes it's pension plans, sometimes it's institutional investors. But what they're all doing is they've identified an asset class that isn't correlated with interest rates, isn't correlated with equity market returns. And by allocating a portion of their investments to the insurance asset class, they're able to move out on the efficient frontier and earn higher returns for their investors. That's attracted capital into the insurance business, which means that the law of supply and demand that I mentioned earlier is different today because you have more capital that flows into and out of the industry more easily than it did in the past. So when I look at the insurance industry, it's a lot more stable than it was historically. Also, a lot more resilient than it was historically.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that, I think, market conditions are improving for us. That we have faced a headwind in recent years. If you look at this chart on the top part of the page, this is an index that reflects global insurance pricing. If you think from 2013 through 2017, insurance prices were decreasing. So we were fighting through headwinds. At every renewal that we were doing, every piece of new business that we were placing, the prices were going down on. Since we are a commission-and-fee business, that means the commission and fees that we were collecting were going down. What you see happen in 2018 is you see that, that turns the corner and that prices are beginning to rise. It's not a hard market, like what we saw in the early 2000s. If you look at prices increasing, it's probably around 2% on average. So not terribly exciting, but it's nice to have a tailwind instead of the headwind that we've had to overcome for the past 5 years. The other thing that's nice is if you look at the red line on the bottom chart, you see that unemployment has been declining. You're all familiar with that. But what you might not think about is that as businesses employ more people, they have to insure more people, so they have to buy more insurance. And then if you look at the gray line on the bottom of this chart, you see that GDP has been accelerating. You're familiar with that as well. But when GDP accelerates, it means that there is more construction. It means that there is more investment. It means that there is more trade. It means that there is more transportation. It means that there is more to insure. So when you think about the tailwinds that I'm describing in our business, we're insuring more economic activity, we're insuring more employees and we're insuring them at higher prices.</p><p>If you look at our performance through the cycles, I guess one thing that I would point out is that if -- you see that our organic growth improved from '16 to '17, it's improved from '17 to '18 and it's improved sequentially in every quarter in '18. So I really like the momentum that I see in our business. You also see that we have a long-term history of outperforming the changes in rates. So when you look at it and say, \"Well, rates are increasing around 2% or so on average,\" we have a history of having a nice spread against to that rate increase.</p><p>The organic growth that I mentioned is something that I'm particularly excited about. If you look at our third quarter results that we reported recently, we reported 6.7% organic growth. Our peer group reported an average of 4.8% organic growth. So a significant outperformance. And if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we are at 5%. Our peer group average is at 4.8%. As I mentioned, our organic growth has been accelerating each quarter of this year. So I'd hope to see our organic growth rate for the full year continue to expand our lead against our peer group average.</p><p>If you look at our performance as a business year-to-date, there's a fair amount of information on this slide, but what I would highlight for you is that we have strong performance on a broad basis across our business. Our results aren't being driven by 1 part or 2 parts of this platform. If you look at our new business statistics, we are up 12% year-over-year. That's the best new business growth that we've seen in a very long time. Our retention is also very strong. So when you have strong retention and you have strong new business, it leads to strong organic growth. That organic growth has allowed us to overcome a very significant headwind that we faced this year. We received profit commissions related to business that we've written in prior years. It's not related to activity that we do in the current year. Well, as you are well aware, there were significant storms last year that eroded profit commissions that we would have earned this year. That was about a $34 million revenue headwind that we had to overcome through organic growth, and you see from our noninterest income numbers that we were able to overcome that. And then even more significantly, that -- those profit commissions are very high margin. There is very little expense that goes against those profit commissions. So not only were we able to overcome them on a revenue basis. You see that from a margin standpoint, we were able to overcome the erosion of those profit commissions as well. I commented earlier on Regions Insurance, what a good fit that is. It's really a great combination. When you look at their producer profile, their client profile, the carriers that they work with, their geographic coverage, the systems that they use. It's a perfect fit with our retail business. And as I mentioned, the conversions have gone very, very well.</p><p>We've launched a transformation across insurance. So we've engaged consultants that have helped us put together a plan to further accelerate our organic growth and expand our margins. We have more than 30 initiatives across insurance in our Retail business, in our Wholesale business and our Life Insurance business that have specific activities, specific road maps, specific ownership that we believe will lead to higher organic growth, higher margins, which will translate into higher earnings for BB&amp;T shareholders. You see some of those key bullet points mentioned here. When I think about the overall strategy, in addition to higher organic growth and higher margins, it's that we want this insurance broker to be dynamic. It is a world-class platform. We want it to have the flexibility to be able to compete with our peer group. And through that, we have really evolved the governance relationships with BB&amp;T, recognizing that this isn't a balance sheet business. It isn't a credit business. It's a commission-and-fee income statement business. And we have the ability to continue to leverage BB&amp;T's scale and services so that we're, in my opinion, well ahead of our peer group in terms of things like cybersecurity, in terms of things like data centers and disaster recovery plans. I think the robust nature of those things at BB&amp;T is a real advantage for our business and for our clients.</p><p>One of the things that we're focusing on in this transformation is data and analytics. I wanted to take a minute, and I'll be quick, to share with you a couple of examples of what we're doing there because a lot of people talk about data and analytics. But unless you have a really clear idea of what you are doing, you may not get any value from it. We have a pretty good idea of what we're doing. So this example is from CRC, our wholesale property and casualty business. If you look at the traditional model for the wholesale property and casualty business, it was very transactional. You would have a retail broker that would have a relationship with the wholesale broker, that would have a relationship with an underwriter at an insurance carrier. And based on those relationships, they would be able to place coverage for an insured. But a very transactional business model. What we have done, and we're considered the industry leader in this space, is several years ago, we begun to capture the data on all of the placements that we make. So today, we have 280,000 total policy records, $17 trillion of total insured value, $6.5 trillion of growth sales, 1.6 million locations, 40,000 loss records that's in our data warehouse. We're able to take that information, we're able to share it with insurance carrier partners so that they're able to more efficiently quote on risk, they're able to price better because they have better information. We're able to share that information with the retail clients of CRC. We provide benchmarking solutions to our clients. We provide an analyzer to CRC's retail clients so that they can more efficiently manage their business. And we're able to efficiently place small business. That's a challenge that the industry has had for a long time. We, in fact, quote more than 1 million small business accounts a year. And that's another unique space that we're in.</p><p>So in summary, I said that there were 4 things that I hope you would take away from this presentation: the first is not only are we big. Sure, we're the fifth largest insurance broker in the world. But we're unique. We're differentiated. We're very different than the other insurance brokers that you saw on that league table; second, our environment is improving. We're going from having headwinds to having tailwinds; third, we've got a transformation underway to really improve earnings; and fourth, this is a client-first business. It's focused on growth. So I think it's a very powerful, unique, resilient platform.</p><p>Thank you very much for your time today. And I'd like to introduce Barbara Duck.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>BARBARA F. DUCK, SENIOR EVP &amp; CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: Good morning. I'm Barbara Duck. I'm the Chief Information Officer for BB&amp;T. On behalf of our executive management team, again, we appreciate so much you all being here today. And I hope that you've had an opportunity to visit some of the key offset we have available to you. This is just one example of some of the things that we're doing both in the financial insights area as well as some of the automation that we have throughout our company. And we have a great individuals who'll share some of those success stories with you out and available.</p><p>What I want to talk to you this morning about transformation In Technology and some of the things that we are doing to prepare for our digital future. And I think, each of our executive managers who have spoken to you already today have done a great job of really setting up the opportunity for why it's important for us to transform our technology operations at BB&amp;T. One of the things that, I think, is important is to recognize the great job that our teams are already doing. And Chris spoke to you this morning about some of the major accomplishments that we've made as an organization since the last time we met at an Investor Day. And when he did that, he shared with you a lot of accomplishments that had technology intermingled with those, things like RU platform, the implementation of our commercial lending system that we call CLIP. You also heard about the data center and the installation there as well as you also heard about our general ledger platform. All areas where technology associates were heavily involved in making those such a success. And then sprinkled throughout the presentations that you've heard this morning, you've heard about the importance of our technology future and where we're headed. You've heard many executives talk about the importance of the future of the digital transformation that we need to make and how we need to embed that together. And it's really more important now than it has ever been, for us as a technology organization, to be uniquely aligned to our business partners.</p><p>So let me tell you how we're going to do a transformation in technology. 4 key takeaways that I would share with you today as we walk through this presentation: one, we want to talk about our transformation and technology and how that is driving cost optimization in our business. How we are actually taking cost out to reinvest in these important opportunities; the second area I want to describe to you is our new business model and the way that we're working with our business partners to be tightly aligned; the third area that we want to cover and focus on is to talk about automation, lean process improvements and other things that we're doing in the technology area to make our business easier to do business with and more efficient; and then lastly, we want to talk about how we're fortifying our cyber defenses and other things to make sure that we protect the assets of both our client as well as our company.</p><p>So we've started on a journey called Transformation in Technology about this time last year. So we've been on this journey about 1 year, and we've got about another year to go. In that process, one of the things that we felt was very important for our associates to have is a connection not only to the vision and the mission of our organization but also a connection to how we and data and technology services associates would help that vision and mission of our corporation come to life. And so we put together, really, a tagline or a vision for our associates that's listed for you here. It says, \"Enabling tomorrow today.\" And you might look at that and say, \"That's very short. It's very simple.\" And it is, but it's also very memorable and it leaves for our associates every day a challenge for them that they need to achieve and accomplish. And the first word, I think, is very powerful for us as data and technology services associates. So that's all about enablement. How do we enable all of that business change that you saw on the previous slides and with the previous presenters? How do we enable that to actually come to life? It's one thing to dream it. It's another thing to build it and make it happen. And that is what we are partnering to do.</p><p>The last 2 elements of the way we describe this, when we talk about Enabling Tomorrow Today is really about how do we pull forward those dreams and goals and hopes and lives that we want to provide to our clients in the future and execute on those as rapidly as possible to deliver that value to the client sooner? You can see here, our mission is really about providing superior value to all of our constituents in our mission statement and making sure that we do that by creating a distinctive WOW experience. And I'll just pause on that just for a minute. Again, it sounds maybe simplistic to say we're going to create a WOW experience, but I would challenge you to think about your own life and what you do every day. Each of you have a device of some kind. Many of you have multiple devices of many kinds with you today. They enable you to do what you do in life. They enable you to do your job, they enable you to connect with your family, they enable you to create the experiences that you need to provide. I doubt you go home at night thinking about what's my bank going to do for me today through their great website and application? But what you do think about today is what experience am I trying to provide to my family, to my friends, to myself and how am I going to make that possible? And we're trying to create engaging and dynamic platform that will provide you and others like you that our clients, the ability to do that and live your life in a way that were so eloquently described in the commercial that Brant showed you earlier.</p><p>So as we're trying to create this WOW experience, one of the things that we felt was important to do was really vision out the horizons and the impacts that we expect to see from a technology perspective. And there is 3 important horizons that we are focused on. The first one that you see here is around stability and risk management. This is all about ensuring that our platforms as well as our systems have strong production stability as well as making sure that for large project implementations, that we do those in a coordinated fashion, a timely fashion and executed with precision. The second horizon that you see here is really about setting the foundation for the future. It's about our infrastructure and our applications and making sure that they're scalable, that they're flexible, that they can be adaptable to change at a rapid speed that you heard Kelly described last night and you've also heard others described today. And the third horizon that you see here is about enabling our company to really stay at the forefront of our industry. It is critical for us to be able to compete, to make sure that we can provide those technology services that our clients and our lines of business need to make sure that they are successful.</p><p>In our Transformation in Technology program, we have several opportunities to make sure that we not only change the technology business but we also give the opportunity to do continued investment in digital transformation. And so I'm going to describe to you in our short time before lunch, 4 primary areas. We're going to talk about cost optimization, we'll talk about our new business models, we'll talk about our new delivery model, we'll spent a few minutes talking about lean and process automation. And underlying those, from a foundational component, are 2 prominent areas: one is all about data and the importance of data and what we're doing in that area; and also, our continued focus on cybersecurity. And it's really a component of all of these things, the aggregation these 6 items, that will give us the results that we're looking for, which is all around having a more technology-enabled business.</p><p>So where did we start? In the December time frame of last year, we partnered with McKenzie &amp; Associates to assist us in looking at the cost within our technology organization. We did a baseline compared to peers and other technology organizations to see whether we were doing a good job, great job in areas that we might need to improve upon. And it was really those foundational elements that we've went through that leveraged for us then an opportunity over the next year to partner again with McKenzie to say, \"How do we take advantage of the things that we're already doing very well? And then how do we also take cost out of our business to make sure that we can reinvest those things to drive digital transformation?\" You'll see that we did this baseline component, and then we began to do the hard work of implementing those changes. One of the key primary areas that we have been focusing on is called workforce management or what we would also call smart sourcing. Over 40% to 50% of the cost that is in our technology organization is all about the people that we have. It's around the workforce we have, the associates we have and the outside labor, whether that be contract or whether it be outside offshore professionals that help us get work done. So it is important that we examine that and make sure that we have very crisp processes to make sure that we align the right people at the right time to accomplish the objectives that we have as an organization.</p><p>And then, we were looking at how do we scale up for the future. And again, this is about how we look at making sure that we process optimize our business. And this is a component that we are heavily engaged at the current moment, and I'll give you a few examples of that shortly.</p><p>So let me describe for you our new business model. Again, we felt it was more important now than ever to closely align to our businesses to make sure that we can deliver. So we aligned, in the first half of this year, we designated Business Information Officers. Think of those as many CIOs that are aligned to the businesses that you've heard present day. The 6 that you see upon the left-hand side of this chart show you things from everything from our digital services and marketing teams all the way through our financial services group. We are aligned to them. Now what does that really mean? It means that those many CIOs or BIOs that we have in our organization now have organization alignment. So instead of being aligned in a very silent way, which is traditional for IT or technology shops where you might have security, infrastructure, application development and maintenance and support, we've brought all of those resources and aligned them directly to the businesses. So think of them as the many agile team put together, working around the table, so to speak, together to support Rufus, for example, or Brant. So that when they have an idea that they want to bring to life, we can come together as a technology partner and make sure that we deliver on that from end to end in the fastest way that we can do that. It really does make it easier to do business with us and it makes it faster to deliver on products. I was actually talking to one of our clients, meaning, one of our associates that runs one of our businesses, just a few weeks ago. And he used the words like amazing, great experience, and I could not be delivering to my clients today, but things that I'm delivering without this new organizational structure where I have someone who is aligned to my business. It gives them much more of a feel of being in a small business environment, whether technology partners are embedded with them every day, focused on their objectives and getting it done. And those teams are certainly supported by a strong shared services organization.</p><p>But it is not enough to be aligned just from a Business Information Officer perspective. It is critically important not only that we be aligned correctly, but we have our delivery model that can support that fast delivery system. And so we have engaged in a process to help bring to each those Business Information Officers the ability to do software development in an agile way, also to bring DevOps to them as well as infrastructure as a service. Think of it, obviously, as the ability to deliver software either in internal cloud, external cloud, public cloud environment. It's making those applications, have the ability to deliver in that way.</p><p>So when we think about agile, we think about it's all about discovering the right thing at the end of the day. It is about taking those big ideas that our lines of businesses have and break them down into what we call little big ideas. And taking those little big ideas and actually being able to deliver on them faster. At the end of the day, our digital transformation is really all about the delivery of software. If you don't have code designed to do what you need to do and be able to deliver it quickly, you can't get to the RAC mobile app that you saw earlier. You can't get to enhancements in the new platform or a wealth client. We have to be able to deliver the software code in quick, reliable increments. And that is what agile does for us.</p><p>But agile alone is not enough. It's not about just discovering the right thing. It's also about the ability to deliver the right thing. And we do that through DevOps and infrastructure as a service. It's about taking the things that you see, the software code that has been delivered and making sure that we can do frequent delivery of that software code through automated pipelines that are secured -- excuse me, secure and stable. This gives us not only an ability to deliver faster, but we have risk mitigation in the process, reducing the number of touches and reducing the number of errors that could be in that particular product, which means that we can deliver faster to our clients.</p><p>So we've talked about taking cost out of the business. We've talked about a new business model. We've talked about a new delivery model. And all of those things are critically important. But at the end of the day, if we don't change the processes within, which our teams work, to make sure that those processes are streamlined and make sure that they are effective, it is very difficult to get work done. We should really think of the technology shop as a very large factory. And each of you, if you had an order that you wanted to provide to me to get work done, you would all bring me that order in various ways. Let's say that you put them in front of the stage here and you'd say, \"We need for you to get this work done.\" I need a way that I can bring that work in, organize it very effectively and make sure that I see that it goes to the factory in a timely fashion. You don't want the product to stop at one place and build up or it won't be able to continue. And you don't really get any value out of the technology shop until you can deliver the product from the other end to touch either the associate or the client to make the process better. And so the process optimization work that we are embarking on is critically important for our organization. We are embedding lean experts within all of our team so that this will be a constant lean improvement and reinvention process that we will be able to do on an ongoing basis. There's a lot of different things on this slide that talk about the different areas that we are going to focus on and where we're going to do process improvement. But let me just give you one example of where we're working currently.</p><p>In each of our development areas, we have both application maintenance as well as application development teams. We've gone in and worked with one of those teams to do some initial lean process work to improve the visibility of the work and how the work actually flows through the process. In doing that, we have found that we can get an increase of 10% to 15% additional work throughput through those teams. We think that's critically important for our future because it gives us the ability to deliver faster and actually deliver more work to our lines of businesses so that we can actually do this digital transformation that you have been hearing about.</p><p>On the foundation of all those things I have laid out for you are 2 additional items I'd like to share with you: one is around data; and the other is cyber. So data is the way of the future. We have to have strong data elements that we can deliver to our businesses. You heard John just speak about data and how important that is to this business. Data has always been something we've been good at, but data is something that we need to be great at. And if you see here some of the things that we have a from a data strategy perspective, we have goals to automate everything around our data. The more it's automated, the faster it's available, the more likely we can give to our business partners real-time information for them to be able to execute on, whether that is delivering on a client so that they can have a need analysis or we can give them the next-best product or delivering on a recorded information so that we can do collections faster. Whatever it might be, it is important for us to make sure that we are automating the data that we have. The second component that we want to do is make sure that we democratize that data. We need to make it available for our teams, we need to make it readily in their hands so that they can slice and dice it, analyze it and execute on it. They don't need to wait in line for someone to run them a report. And then lastly in the data space, we need to make sure that we optimize the operations that we have, making sure that we have a very streamlined process to make sure that we are delivering quickly on the data information.</p><p>Cybersecurity is also a very important component for us to deliver on and continue to make investments in. Our team -- in particular, Kelly has been very outspoken in regards to cyber and the importance of making sure that we are protecting our financial institutions as well as making sure that we're protecting our clients. We've continued to invest in this area. And over the next few years, you will continue to see investments in this space, in particular, on these 3 items: one is making sure that we are focused on access control and making sure that, that access control is tightly controlled. It is very, very important to make sure that you are protecting your most important information from a privileged access as well as who else can get access to that information; we also want to make sure that we're focused on capability acceleration, in particular, focusing on fortifying our cyber defenses and protection; and lastly, we want to make sure that we're focusing on ensuring that we have the right skills and talents to make sure that we can continue the development and growth and the cyber capabilities that we have within our organization.</p><p>This shows you a quick look at what our cyber investments have looked like over the past few years. It shows you a growth and our expensive share from around $23 million to over $100 million in investments, both baseline and projects across the different teams. I will also add that we have investments in other parts of our business that may not show up here when you think about infrastructure around firewalls and those types of things. Those things would be listed separately so the number is actually higher than what you see here. You also see the investments in our staffing growing from 50 associates back in the 2009 time frame to over 269 associates that we'll have at the end of 2018. A critical area for us to continue to invest and make sure that we have the protection that we need.</p><p>One of the last things I want to share with you is about where do we focus and invest from a technology perspective with our financial dollars. We've been given here about $1.1 billion to invest across our technology organization. It's critical for us to make sure, in that investment round, that we do the absolutely the best investment across that and optimization of those dollars as we can. You see a good portion of our dollars is in what we call infrastructure spending about, 61%. These are the things that you think of as lights and doors open, production types of things that we do to run our business. Then you'll see that we have about 20% of our dollars are invested in innovation and innovative projects that we are working on. And then an additional 14% on other types of important fundamental portfolio projects that we have across the organization.</p><p>So in summary, I would just like to close with saying you can see how critically important it is for our organization to make sure that we have a technology organization that can enable our business, insuring, again, that we take the cost out where appropriate to reinvest from a digital standpoint, making sure that we have a strong business support model for our lines of businesses, ensuring that we have cost optimization and lean process automation across the teams and lastly, making sure that we are continuing to invest from a cybersecurity standpoint.</p><p>I thank you for your time this morning. I'm now going to turn it over to Rich to give you instructions for the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: Just a quick announcement. Because of the flight delays yesterday, we've made arrangements for those of you that were not able to make it to the tour of the Leadership Institute. This afternoon, when we're done with our session, we will have shuttles taking you to the airport, but there is going to be a shuttle at 3:15 that's going to take you to the Leadership institute, allow you the time to take the tour. And then from there, take you right to the airport. So if you look at your schedule, you'll see tour shuttles going at 3:15 and 3:45 to the airport. Those are still in place, but there will be another shuttle that will take you to the Leadership institute and then on to the airport.</p><p>So at this time, we're going to break for lunch. And a member of our executive management team is going to be seated at each one of the tables and their name will be on the table. So this is going to give you an opportunity, if you have specific topics you want to discuss, to sit with that executive. And our team out the door, they're going to direct you to where we're going to have our plated lunch. And we've added about 50-minute time to lunch to allow you more time to look at the exhibits. So we're going to begin the afternoon session promptly at 12:45. See you then.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>DONT\u00c3\u00a1 L. WILSON, SENIOR EVP &amp; CHIEF DIGITAL &amp; CLIENT EXPERIENCE OFFICER, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: Well, good afternoon, everybody. Dont\u00c3\u00a1 Wilson. Happy to be with you all today to talk about client centricity. So what is client centricity? Client centricity is a energy, it's a passion, it's a deep commitment and focus on the client. It's not about just putting the client first, but it's really about putting the client at the center of everything that we do.</p><p>So today, I'm going to talk to you all about 4 strategic deployments that we have going on to create client centricity. And but embedded in those 4 strategic strategies that we are deploying there's four key takeaways. One of the first key takeaways is we're creating a client-centric client experience of distinction.</p><p>Number 2, we're inspired by the voice of the client and inspired by the data that we'll received and to make better decisions to assist our clients in their financial dream.</p><p>Number 3, we are empowered by dynamic technology, and #4 is, how we're growing digital accounts and digital revenue.</p><p>The 4 strategic areas that we're focused on right now are: one, our enterprise Voice of the Client program; two, our insights-driven client experience, which is super important for us. I'm going to share today with you some revolutionary marketing things we are deploying that are really, really working for us in a major way. And then we're going to talk a little bit about digital transformation, give you update on where we are, and a little bit of vision casting so you could see where we're going.</p><p>I get the chance to wake up every day to work with a group of very passionate and really client-obsessed, I mean, absolutely obsessed associates around creating client distinction. And these burgundy hexagons represent those teammates that do this every day, working side-by-side with our business segment partners to do a couple of things. One, to bring client insight; two, to codevelop strategy; and three, to aid in execution. So let's talk about how we're doing that together with our business segment partners.</p><p>So Voice of the Client program. What we really believe is that if you're going to elevate your game to be a leader -- continue to be a leader in client experience, you have to move beyond just syndicated studies and benchmarks. It is great to see where you stack up against your peers, which is very, very valuable, but it's even more important to know how do your clients feel about you.</p><p>Your peers don't bring you accounts, your clients bring you accounts. So for us, when we move beyond client benchmarking and syndications, it's about really getting more robust feedback information directly from our clients.</p><p>So in 2018, we rolled out an enterprise-wide Voice of the Client digital platform to enable us to do that. It's multi-channel and multi-lines of business where we get real -- near real-time feedback from our clients that are doing business with us.</p><p>What that enables us to do is that we're able to get information and be able to coach our associates in a very valuable way. We're able to push a button. Right now, I could push a button on my iPad or iPhone to tell you what our overall satisfaction scores are at the bank level, I could tell you what it is at the regional level, I could tell you what it's at the branch level, at the mortgage loan office level or at a branch bank level.</p><p>So we have a very valuable feedback that gives us information. We can continuously are able to improve our overall client experience. So how are we using the Voice of the Client program today? So there's a couple of things what we're doing. We're able to identify our clients near real-time that are at risk. So if they give us a bad feedback on one of the surveys that we present to them through their mobile device, or through their telephone. We have a client delight team that calls them immediately and try to solve that particular issue.</p><p>We're also very focused on reading and understanding all the verbatim comments. So if you just check a box, around what your problem is, you might not get to the root cause. So using text analytics to get at what the real root cause of the problems are so that we can correct them.</p><p>We're using really good linkage analysis, where we've taken performance metrics and we're taking client metrics and making better business decisions. And then we're also using, as I mentioned, the Voice of the Client information in their coach. So if the coach is doing a good job, we're able to high-five and say, \"That's a really, really good job.\" It reinforced a great behavior and if they didn't do a good job it gives opportunity to come up with a coaching plan to improve it so that it can do a better job on the next experience.</p><p>Equally important, we're looking at the trends and evaluating the trends that we're saying will happen across our multiple lines -- on multiple lines of business so we can make real-time correction. Once you know what you're trends are, you know what your systemic problem may be potentially across your lines of businesses and across your channels, then you have to do something about it.</p><p>So what we do, we've launched this group called the Clients First Solutions team. It's basically a problem-solving SWAT team. This is a group of team that's a cross-functional team, that work together in an agile way to eliminate client friction and client effort in near real time as possible.</p><p>So they meet every couple of weeks and every month, we make decisions to improve the business and to improve the client experience for our particular clients within BB&amp;T.</p><p>There's 3 primary things that they work on: one, they work on items related to policy; second, items related to process; and three, items related to product. And so from a policy perspective, then we've done things such as enhance our authorities within our local community bank.</p><p>So the people that are working directly with the client can respond a lot quicker. From a process perspective, we've done things like introduce intelligent automation to our hold process, so we can have more accurate, more speedy responses and client-friendly hold scenarios without introducing any risk. And you'll see here on this deck that we've reduced the hold within the first 2 weeks to 67% by having our intelligent automation system aid or human associates that are in the branches.</p><p>And then third, we've done things like products such as our Click View. So one of the main reasons why clients would call would be when they have an overdraft. So they call our care centers and they call our branches, cause they don't understand the sequence of what caused their overdraft.</p><p>So now we have it available to our clients, and we develop this in a couple of months, the ability to be able to push on their iPhone and touch the overdraft and be able to sequential -- or to be able to tell what caused that overdraft?</p><p>So these are the type of things that we're bringing to our client experience to elevate it on a continuing basis. We've introduced 33 of these year-to-date, which all have been phenomenal and it's making a big difference in our business.</p><p>So let's take a look at the big difference that it's making in our business, having a complete all-in client focus opportunity here. So we got 2 things that we're measuring our Voice of the Client program: one is the net promoter score.</p><p>Our net promoter score, if you look at your -- the chart to the left, what it is, you take the client that give you top-box scores. So that's 9s or 10s as it relates to, \"Would you recommend this to a friend or a colleague?\"</p><p>And then you subtract the delta out of the detractors. So those would give you a 6 or less. So you'll see in the month of September, we had 70% of folks gave us a 9 or 10, and then we had 11% gave us a 6 or below, and that delta is a 59.</p><p>Now what we've seen is that although we already had good Net Promoter Score, we've been able to improve that score with this type of focus on our client year-to-date. So that's really, really impressive. And as it relates to the Net Promoter Score, I know that you all follow that, but just for those that may not follow as closely, the Net Promoter Score is on a negative 100 to a positive 100 scale. So if you get a 1, that's considered good; you get a 50, it's considered excellent. So for us to have these types of scores, we'll really excited about that and looking to continue to improve that over time.</p><p>We look at the overall satisfaction score. Overall satisfaction score just basically says your overall experience, your omni experience, how satisfied are you -- are you with BB&amp;T. We started the program as early as February, we're already at 68% of folks giving us a 9 or 10. And you all know how tough it is to get a 9 or 10 -- a perfect 10 as it relates to anything. And so they're saying we're at a 9 or 10 with 68%. We've improved that number year-to-date and have our highest scores yet at a 73%. So we're very excited that both of these opportunities allow us to continue to elevate our game as it relates to client experience. It's also making a big difference in our book of business. So we look at our attrition numbers and look at gross attrition year-over-year, we're down 4% on gross attrition. So it's making a significant difference to our business and having business results, which create revenue to capture opportunities for us.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about being an insights-driven client experience, this, from our organization, which is super important. What we're doing, you heard a lot of talk about data analytics. It's a popular buzzword. And definitionally, if you're doing data analytics, you're looking at past behavior and using that past behavior and you're really trying to do some predictive modeling in most cases to try to create a better outcome for your client. What we're really trying to move from and have already begun the process to move from data analytics to really data synthesis, that you can be near real-time as possible. So we want to make sure that we're taking this what we call rich data and turn it into wealthy data, data that will really have an opportunity to create a solution for our client as soon as we can for that particular client.</p><p>A couple of things that we're doing. So if you go -- if you take a look at the slide here, you'll see that we've launched the Client Data Lake. Client Data Lake for us is a centralized repository for data. It's a data processing tool at which we're are able to take from hundreds of sources all the data that we have on our clients, be it transactional, be it behavior, be it third-party and put it in one place so we can create a better experience for our client. So we're able to offer real -- near-real-time information to the right client at the right time, the right information with the right channel.</p><p>Just to give you an example of it, the difference between data synthesis and data analytics. So if you use kind of data analytics type model and you're doing marketing, you may have took a group of clients that had these opportunities and then modeled that they will be great credit card leads. And by the time you go send that e-mail, use your e-automation to market to those clients, what if yesterday they called and had a client complaint in your care center. Would they be real excited about getting an e-mail about a credit card? Probably not. So what your Data Lake allows you to do is embed that client feedback, so real time if it's says, oh, they just got a -- we just had a call about a concern around client service, instead of that lead going through and you market into that client, it would trigger maybe someone from a virtual banking center to call, then trigger someone from maybe one of our branches to call.</p><p>The same thing will be true, if we had a credit card lead for that same group of folks and that data put $1 million of deposits into our banking system. Instead of sending that credit card, what would happen there real time is a teller automation would tee you up that the most likely best call at the moment is probably to one of our wealth advisers or someone who can help them with that deposit they just made versus the credit card. So that's what the Data Lake would empower us to do, is you -- be able to have near real-time opportunities and solutions for our clients.</p><p>There's lot of other things we're doing as it relates to insights and analytics. I'd just call out one here that's listed, which is around our analytics and predictive modeling really using machine learning to offer what we call the Next Best Action. So our branch bankers and our market leaders today in the branches, when they walk in, we're able to provide to them their client base and have a top 6 in order what is the best conversation to have next with your client. We're also doing this and in the works to roll this out for our commercial business as well so that officers now can have call efficiency as it relates to prioritization of who should I call next and when should I call them. So we're doing data analytics and data synthesis and talking directly to clients, but we're also enabling our officers to be able to have better call prioritization so they can get the best of both worlds.</p><p>Let's take a look at some things we're doing as it relates to revolutionary marketing. There isn't a better time to be a marketer than it is today. The 4 Ps of marketing had not changed. What has changed is the dynamic inputs that go into the 4 Ps, and how do you apply the 4 Ps in a more digital environment. We're super excited to see the progress that we're making as it relates to understanding that and really it's a game changer for us, because at the end of the day, those that could do this best are going to have the best opportunities to create future revenue. So I want to share with you what we believe is our ultimate client experience as it relates to marketing.</p><p>This is the vision that we casted 2 years ago, a vision of going from one-way communication, where we just put up a billboard and hope someone reads it or we just send them a brochure and hope that we've sent it to the right people to really try to engage in a client's life, have a full integration. Well, we're responding and talking to the client simultaneously, based on their behaviors, based on their transactions, based on what they're doing with the website, and we're serving up content at their particular convenience. So I want to do is show you this vision we've casted and that we've been working on through Lisa. So you'll see Lisa have a series of communications with us and thus, have a series of commission with Lisa and at the end of the day, how many solutions she selects at the convenience of her phone without even having to come into the branch.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DONT\u00c3\u00a1 L. WILSON: So this is what we're calling always on. This is our north star. When you see the 2-way communication, we're fully integrated into Lisa's life. She got a credit line increase, she got a pre-approval on our mortgage opportunity, we gave her some traveling tips, we also were able to offer free insurance quote so she can make her complete transaction or move more successful. That's our vision. But as you all know, vision without execution is hallucination. So let me just tell you what we've done so far. So we've moved from traditional marketing, where we had the division where we're just kind of 1-way communication. So we're about middle-of-the-road where we're doing more solution-based, more triggers and activities. So if someone uses Venmo today, by tomorrow, we could send them an e-mail, because it's going to trigger to them and send them opportunity to try out our Zelle opportunity. But when we unlock the potential of the Data Lake, when it's full stood up, which is in process of being stood up today, in 2019, it'd be fully stood up, we'd be able to have 4 convergence where we'll going to have the right message at the right time, and that is the real game changer. So we're making lots of good progress, the teams are working really, really to hard.</p><p>Let me just show you some of the progress they've been making year-to-date on this -- well, since 2015. If I could direct your eyes to the first bullet point in each of the years. So in 2015, we were executing -- we executed on 108 campaigns. If you look at 2018, we have executed or would have executed on 332 campaigns, so significant increase in activity. Look at e-mails, we first started with email automation back in 2015, 3.2 e-mails that we sent out to touch our clients. Year-to-date, we've already sent out 63 million e-mails to touch our clients. But even direct mail, still have direct mail solution. So direct mail, we've sent out 3.4 million e-mail pieces, we would have sent 18 million e-mail pieces by the end of this year, so a dramatic increase in activity.</p><p>I can call out a couple of things. In 2017, you heard Chris talked about earlier, where we had a brand refresher, where we introduced the new tagline, All We See Is You, it is really letting the world know that we are very much focused on being client-centric, that they are the most important piece of our business. They are our why in addition to making the world a much better place to live. I can also call out in 2018 that we've launched a campaign, it's a 5-year campaign, that we call IGNITE, that we've already brought in 46,000 new-to-bank households.</p><p>And we look at those new-to-bank households, which is phenomenal, because I know you've all been asking similar questions around, what is your CPA, your cost per acquisition. You see folks at a marketplace with $500 incentives, we've been able to move this business with $130 type of incentive on average when you look at the blend. So we're doing much better with our spend, much more smatter, better techniques to able to move over these type of households, and we're getting good account growth from that, so we're super excited about that. We're also getting youthful account growth. So when you look at our new-to-bank clients, the average age of our new-to-bank clients, the median is 34 years old.</p><p>The mode age, which is the most popular, is 18. But if we look at the future of the business, and you see that we're bringing in that type of client base, that actually really fair well for us in the future.</p><p>Another thing I'd like to call out here is the 10 always-on campaigns we've already deployed, and so there will be thousands of those, we've already got those up and running and is often great benefit to us. And then the last thing would be the returns that we're getting on marketing. So we're getting a 2 to 1 from a revenue to expense ratio on our marketing. And the reason why that's unlocking that particular opportunity is because you have a digital, which is much more efficient, and allows you to do that.</p><p>We still do a good deal of traditional marketing, because traditional marketing will always be important. That's kind of how you build your brand awareness so people can know who you are, they have to know who you are before you can actually do something digitally where they could take action. And we're doing things like billboards, we're also doing TV. What we find in our marketing cocktail is where we have additional marketing and digital marketing, we're seeing up to 2x more success rate and responses in those marketplaces. So perfect opportunity to have the right cocktail.</p><p>That being said, digital marketing, where it's at. So I want to congratulate Barbara Duck and her team with the website optimization. So we have responsive designs, what you see on your desktop, you see on your mobile device and you also see on your iPad, which is important. We also have accessibility design, which allows us if we have clients that are visually impaired, we can allow them to also enjoy quality banking.</p><p>Our social media game has really picked up. We've had 3x more social media followers than we started off with in 2015. So we're doing a lot in that particular area. Our search engine marketing has really took off. We've had great results from that. We've already had research engine authorization, but we really never did search engine marketing, that's where you go out and you go on broker words, it's a blind broker, so you might choose a word with asylum, you might choose banking, you might choose student. Someone else is in the marketplace, we put $50 on each word, someone else put $100 in each word and they're going to show up on our front-page. Well, we were showing up no page, on Page 8, on Page 9. How many of you all ever bought something on Page 8 or 9, it just did not happen, right? So you have to be on the front-page and because we're active with that and doing very effectively, we're we getting great results.</p><p>And then our e-mail market, our e-automation we said 63 million e-mails sent. So you look at, well, how much do you happen to spend to be successful? Can you spend it up to be really, really good at this business? And we're showing that, we're demonstrating that. Our response rate, our click-through rate, open rates are 27%, and the industry, that's 21%. So again, it's about your technique and your skill in addition to being present.</p><p>At the end of the day, content is still king. So you can have parity with technology, you can have parity with technique, but who can send the most relevant content to get a client to respond. You saw some of those responses or you heard about those responses or impressions that Brant mentioned earlier from one of our emotional led campaigns which is a client journey type campaign, showing clients how the products fit in their life. We also have brand campaigns. We also have product features. It's not good enough just to have the products, you have to tell the world what products that you have. And then we have one of our favorite, which is brand journalism, which is really talking to the good work you do in your community. And as you know, millennials, the Gen Z, they really value the difference that you're making at community when they're selecting partners for business. So I wanted to show you a couple of these commercials, you already seen one. But take a look at our brand commercial, which really focuses in on client centricity.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DONT\u00c3\u00a1 L. WILSON: So that's really designed to reemphasize our attention to our client, the client centricity. This next one is really one of my favorite that we are at our 10-year anniversary of BB&amp;T Lighthouse Project. We've touched 16 million lives, and this is just a way to tell that story to the marketplace, which is called Brand Journalism.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DONT\u00c3\u00a1 L. WILSON: It's really easy to be a marketer, be in brand journalism when you have real associates making a difference. So that's all associates making a difference in community and we wanted to share it with the world. So let's talk digital transformation. Digital transformation is really, really important. Digital transformation takes great strategy, and what we want to do is to give you some insight to let you see how we see the world. So just take a look at our lens on what digital transformation really is.</p><p>So for us, digital transformation can be summed up into 4 Is. The first one is inspire. So we want to inspire our associates to create client distinction. The second one is about innovate. We want to innovate with client centricity and operation efficiency as a priority. The third is around invest. We want to invest for the future, but we want to invest now. The pace of change has been as fast as we've ever known it. But forward-looking, tomorrow will be as slow -- today will be as slow as we ever know it. But each day, it gets faster. Then we want to ignite. Then we want to make sure we're doing things that will ignite and ultimately generate household growth and also revenue growth.</p><p>So let's talk about inspire. So we inspire for 3 different categories. One, we inspire from our clients. We talked about the Voice of the Client program and other feedbacks. So we want to build and transform based on what your clients want, not just for transforming just to transform. The second is associate inspired. So we have groups like our Client First Solutions team and other associates that give us feedback, because they're dealing with the client on a daily basis. We take that feedback and we try to respond and build things for our clients based on that feedback. The third is co-inspire, where we co-create the solutions with our clients, which I think is one of the most meaningful ways to be able to build the business.</p><p>This is an example of kind of co-creation. A couple of things that we do as it relates to our digital platform. So we have feedback that we get. We have over 41,000 pieces of feedback that we may get from the Apple rating store, or Android rating store, the CEO line, social media, we take that into consideration. We get feedback from the platform whenever someone opens up an account on one of our online application platforms, we get immediate feedback. So we get 62,000 of those that we've had in 2018. And then we do benchmark performance evaluation. So we want to make sure that when we change something, we're actually improving the process. So most recently with our prequalification application and mortgages, we're able to reduce and study it, we're able to reduce and save about 9 minutes out of that process. And so if we can't improve the performance, we don't create the change. And so we try to track and study all the things. So we make sure we're making a difference in someone's life.</p><p>As it relates to digital future experience, we do a couple of things, one, we have a digital community, 2,000 of our clients. We've had 29,000 sessions with clients where we give them a chance to give us feedback based on the usability assessments or asking them survey questions about what we're building. We also have usability testing where we bring clients and then we have a sessions, you'll see we have 150 sessions where they interact with our prototype, and we get to watch them and interact with them to see and make sure we're building the right thing. And the third, we have the beta testing, where we allow clients to be able test the product before it goes public. I kind of call this mama's kitchen, because it reminds me of being in the kitchen with my mom on Thanksgiving when she's making cake, and she gives a little bit of the cake batter, \"So how does it taste? Should I add a little more sugar?\" She adds a little more sugar. \"How does it taste?\" And when the cake comes out, the cake was perfect because she got feedback along the way. So I call this kind of a mama's kitchen approach. But it's important so we don't develop product without knowing that the client would actually want it or actually use it.</p><p>When you look at how we innovate, we do innovation in 2 different forms, one is internal innovation. So we launch a Test &amp; Learn team. So a Test &amp; Learn team, they do proof of concept, one of those we've been successful with this year was our chat box. So we tested that with our care sitters in our branches and we'll be moving to deployment into '19 but in use case for that. We also had a Hackathon in July. We had 63 of our associates come in and had a Hackathon and really create an innovation culture there. So we did see what ideas they have, that was successful.</p><p>And then we do external things such as sponsorships of the accelerators and incubators of Fintech. So you have to be where innovation is. That also has led to us launching under Brantley's leadership our BB&amp;T Ventures, which is our arm that is designed to invest in and/or acquire digital emerging technologies. We've made our first investment in September in a Data as a Service company called Enigma. You all probably read about that. And they're already out offering real value to us that we're benefiting from.</p><p>We're going to continue to accelerate and bring in innovative talent. We're going to continue to accelerate our Fintech investment and we'll going to form more alliances in order to help this transformation go a lot quicker in the future.</p><p>Our investment themes are here as follows. So we're investing with a purpose, things that help plan the experience: marketing, data analytics, commerce, faster payments, intelligent automation, digital capabilities or innovation. So those are themes of investment that we're looking to invest in. And we have accelerated our digital investments. So from 2017 through 2019, we would've spent $300 million as it relates to digital acceleration.</p><p>We have 20 strategic projects that, that encompasses, things like our platforms. We have things like our digital marketing tools that we're using. So we're making these big strategic investments. But as we look at 2018, we're also doing things that also our providers do not consider strategic projects. So we had 1,500 digital platform releases in 1 year.</p><p>So we're learning and integrally changing and making a difference in clients' lives kind of real time. And we talked about the up to $50 million Fintech investment that we've committed to make.</p><p>If we look at our performance, so what are the results out of this? Because the metrics matter. So what are you doing to actually grow the business? If you look from a digital opportunities, if you look at your top left-hand side and you look at the retail checking, what that pie chart represents is total checking is 15%. This slice represents -- out of all the checking accounts that are open at BB&amp;T, 15% are open through digital acquisition.</p><p>If you look at the arrow beneath that, it shows that we had a 24% year-over-year growth in digital acquisition, which is phenomenal. You look at business checking, it represents 7% of all of our checking accounts that we're opening are open online, so a 36% increase year-over-year, which is also phenomenal.</p><p>If you look at bank card, we're having great success there. It represents 15% of total production, and it's up 62% year-over-year. So we're showing great success.</p><p>Look at our digital users. We have lots of mobile momentum. We're up 19% year-over-year, so we're doing a good job with the momentum there.</p><p>But you look at the things they're using from the digital capabilities' perspective. Look at our mobile check deposit activity. So it's up 40% over last year because we're listening to clients and we're integrally make it better. They wanted to make the ability to take the check better. We fixed that. They wanted to make sure they have better availability. We fixed that. They had some questions around limits. We fixed that. That's how you get 40% year-over-year growth.</p><p>Look at the accolades we're getting. From our app perspective, we have a 4.8 on our mobile app on Apple. That's fantastic. We're #1. We're best-in-class. If you look at Android, we have a 4.5. We've broken into the top 3. So again, that's one of the top 3 in class and have some other ratings here to show that we have one of the best digital platforms in the world.</p><p>If you look at -- looking at digital as a line of business for our revenue, trying to see the impact on your overall business, here's some statistics that we look at and that we track. From a business perspective, so is marketing really paying off? How many business are you getting? We had 143 million visitors to our website, which is phenomenal. 11% of that represents prospects. So those are your opportunities. You continue to get better conversion. That's your real big opportunity to create more success.</p><p>So then you move over to the middle piechart, so what success are you having? So if we look at our net new performance -- I know earlier, we shared our net new performance with you. So what's contributing to that net new? 47.3% of all our net new accounts had a digital acquisition.</p><p>If we look and just break out retail, 56% of our retail net new were through digital acquisitions; and in commercial, 20%, which is really strong when you think about the commercial business now following the retail business.</p><p>Look at what types of success we're having on a CAGR perspective. We've grown 16.6% over the last 3 years. And if you exclude mortgage, our year-over-year date -- year-to-date year-over-year growth is 18%. So again, strong metrics and performance from the investments we're making from a digital revenue perspective.</p><p>This slide right here just really show you all the things that we're doing. It's so important to make sure you're active as it relates to digital transformation, you're making the right investment. So these things that have already been lifted or that are in flight. But what's really important about here is not how much you're spending and how many things you're doing, but are you doing the right things that could make a difference for your client and then drive the business?</p><p>So a good little story that I'd like to think about when I think about how do we compete against maybe larger competitors that are announcing their big investment -- and this is a story about David and Goliath. So you had David and Saul wanted to have David put on his armor, and Saul said -- David said, \"No, I don't wear that. I've got to use what I'm used to, to be able to win.\" He took 5 stones and a slingshot, but it only took one of the stones and he was able to win.</p><p>So it's not about how much you're doing, but that you're doing the right thing. You have the right stones and the right approach to make your business successful, and that's we're refocusing on. This represents that in how we're supporting the business.</p><p>So I want to thank you for listening today. The key takeaways here again: that we're creating client distinction by being client-centric. We're inspired by the voice of the client and all the data that we're able to make -- take for being rich, to being wealthy. We're also empowered by dynamic technology, and we're growing our digital revenue and our digital account acquisition. Thank you all for listening.</p><p>All right. Now I'm going to turn it over to Clarke Starnes.</p><p>CLARKE R. STARNES, SENIOR EVP &amp; CHIEF RISK OFFICER, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for participating in our conference today. We're very proud historically of our risk program at BB&amp;T. So 4 key areas I want you to focus on today. Number one, that we have historically, consistently produced best-in-class risk-adjusted returns. As we look forward in the future though, there are structural industry innovation issues that are creating new and unique risks that we have to give due consideration to. And so we are adapting our risk and control programs to take advantage and embrace that opportunity in a safe and sound manner. And most of all, in today's environment, credit risk is always important and BB&amp;T's claim to continue to maintain our conservative through-the-cycle approach to risk-taking with an intense focus on diversification and granularity.</p><p>So I want to talk to you a little bit about our fundamental approach to risk management and how we view risk appetite. And so there's 3 key elements I want to focus on. One is our through-the-cycle perspective. I'm sure you hear that a lot. It means different things to different people. I think for some people, it means I went to the market through the cycle. And markets can change in their wide degree of risk acceptance. But for us, it means trying to create a diversified business operation that is less sensitive to swings in the economy.</p><p>So for us, what we're really trying to do is to create a mix of businesses that have low relative variability and much higher relative resiliency under stress no matter what the cycle is. And we know that being able to do that, you've got to be intensely focused on diversification. And we have an intentional bias toward granularity in really all aspects of our business operation. Now what that's yielded for us is some really strong results. I've charted for you here lower relative nonaccruals in our credit book but also something we don't talk as much about but is highly relevant in this new world is our ops losses. We have some of the lowest op losses in the entire industry. You can see this in the ABA ops loss consortium data. So again, a very low-risk operational risk profile which again a lot of new operational risks are coming out of this digital innovation.</p><p>This in my favorite slide for you all. I've charted -- I think this the most objective scorecard of our cumulative risk positioning. This looks at the most recent DFAST results, and what I've charted for you is our net PPNR over baseline losses relative to our net stress losses over baseline. And this is in a severely adverse scenario. And I'll just show you we have the best risk-return positioning in the peer group, and we're the only bank in our peer group who's been in northwest quadrant, as I like to tell our folks, for every CCAR cycle since it started. So again, that's the level of consistency we're trying to produce. And this is, I think, in a very objective way to look at it.</p><p>We want to continue those great results though and still embrace innovation and all of the great businesses opportunities you heard my colleagues talk about today, but we have to be mindful that this fast-paced environment that we're in does present new and unique risk considerations, particularly a lot of nonfinancial risks on operational, compliance strategic and reputational side. Obviously, we're not avoiding those changes. We want to embrace that in our disrupt-or-die strategy. But we have to make sure that we have a good risk and control system to take advantage of these opportunities in a safe and sound manner. So I want to think -- we have to think about our risk programs differently. So if you really fundamentally can pull back and think about most traditional risk and control frameworks, they were -- they've been highly linear in nature, variegated, almost a waterfall approach. And so what -- it's not necessarily very agile or client-friendly, may have been effective in the old world. It's not going to be so effective if you're trying to be innovative and react to client demands in this new world we live in.</p><p>So we have to think about how can we reposition our risk controls in a manner that is different. So some of the things that we are doing in thinking about -- for example, is thinking about embedding our risk design and risk controls earlier in the process. So for example, embedding and things like Agile, sprint, reusable risk and control, utilities that have already been standardized. They've been audited. They've validated and tested that we can reuse those in different types of products, not just a customized solution in every case.</p><p>We've got to use different sorts of surveillance and real-time monitoring tools. I'm going to give you a great example I'm very proud of today. Our first Fintech investment was with a company called Enigma. It's a very sophisticated data aggregation utility. We've been able to take that and codevelop a data aggregation, a surveillance program in our AML world that's going to substantially improve both the traditional rules-based programs you see out there today using a lot of -- much greater usage of our various datasets. And then we've combined that. I think Rohan showed that to you out at one of the kiosks. We've combined that with an RPA solution that will substantially improve the efficiency of the workflow around working all of those alerts. That's an example of something we can do today, we could not do a year or 2 ago. And the neat thing about it is we can reuse that approach in many other applications as well. So it's reusable across many, many different dimensions.</p><p>So what we really trying to do is be more insightful and strategic as we think about risk and enable the business transformation that we have laid out for you well in these other presentations.</p><p>But again, we don't want to fool ourselves. You have to think about new and unique risks, and the risks may manifest themselves differently in today's world than you've historically experienced. So I've kind of laid out a number of the things that we're seeing out there that we are considering but we have to think about, particularly the level of operational compliance, privacy risk, et cetera, that comes up. And then we got to make sure that we adapt our risk and control components to address those. Many of these risks may -- you may actually create more risk by trying to solve another risk. So you may be trying to reduce fraud through an authentication profile, but you find out that, that authentication profile is discriminatory and creates compliance risk. So how do you deal with that? So you've got to understand those relationships and avoid unintended consequences. So let me -- before I give a brief-through and give you a few -- things that we're focused on right now and really excited about. First, really prevalent in all of these areas of innovation are 2 key risks. These would be thematic issues for the entire industry you've really got to be focused on. One is just overall, you need a comprehensive and sophisticated change management protocol. But just because of the speed and pace of the things that you're doing, historically again, a bit slow in nature. We've got to move faster, but there are a lot of things going on at once as well. So we've also got to -- have to think about aggregate change risk. Many of these other initiatives I've mentioned involve third and fourth parties, to a degree, never seen before.</p><p>We don't develop all of our solutions, so there's a number of innovative nonbank companies that we all partner with. Those in truth, they operate in the public cloud. They're in the heavy use of APIs, a number of considerations that you have to really think about. So a couple of things that we are doing that I think are serving us well. We are actively participating in some codevelopments of some share utilities through the industry around third-party vendor management. We think that will create some industry certification standards that we don't have today when they enable the banks to come together and more efficiently and effectively get to market with some solutions that will be more difficult for us to do on our own.</p><p>Barbara did a great job and the others that have spoken before me around the innovation, around digital and technology. And so certainly, at the forefront in everyone's mind has been the security or the cyber side. But I would tell you as a CRO, I'm very concerned about technology risk in aggregate being one of the big new risks that you've really got to get your hands around. And this is far beyond just info sets, so it looks -- with some of the things Barbara talked about around application stability and availability, cyber resiliency, data protection and privacy and how all of these things fit together. So one of the things that we are doing, many others very similarly, but we can't just depend on Barbara's group to do that by herself. And so historically, that's been under the -- technology risk has principally been under the CIO or the CISO and the technology group. But we've actually elevated a very strong independent risk function and the second line of defense in my world, and these are staffed by former CIOs, CISO, CTO, people with those kind of pedigrees to come in and help us oversee the rapid programs that Barbara's putting into place and provide appropriate, effective challenge and oversight and reporting. So I'm very excited. We just hired our first CTRO, and he's onboard today and doing a fantastic job.</p><p>The other thing, you also have to think about the convergence that's occurring. So for example, in our financial crimes program, historically, been around money laundering and then put separate programs around basic fraud. And also you have things like security alerts going off and Barbara's -- she talked -- center on the cybersecurity side.</p><p>Well, many times, the bad actors are trying to get through any way they can, so you may be triggering multiple alerts and disparate parts of the bank. So we're trying to think about how we can bring all of that together, either physically through common platforms or decisioning tools or through virtualization. So what we're trying to do is create a more integrated view of the financial crimes risk that's out there, and it's very prevalent in the new applications in the digital world.</p><p>Also compliance and privacy, that's historically been a very manual audit-like function. That will not work in today's world. There are new heightened areas of consideration around privacy and compliance that are actually originating out of these new applications. So we have to think about that differently, much more constant surveillance and monitoring. So we're putting in a brand-new integrated GRC tool to help us utilize much more robust data monitoring, quantitative modeling and things like common risk taxonomy. So it allows you to really unleash the power of the data and manage compliance risk in a much better way.</p><p>The final thing I want to talk about from a risk and control here though is -- it really goes back to our culture and Kelly really hammered that hard yesterday as he should have. And that -- it's great to innovate. And you can put all the risk and controls you want to, but you can't control it all, I don't care how much automation you have. So at the end of the day, we have 36,000 employees that we have to depend upon to execute our processes and serve our clients and take care of all of our stakeholders.</p><p>You cannot do that if you don't -- if you have a strong -- don't have a corporate culture. And so for us, having a just absolute passion for ethics and corporate behavior is really, really important. And what comes out of that is a very, very strong risk culture. And so I sleep very well at night because I've helped 33,000 associates assisting us in risk management.</p><p>A couple of things that we are doing, new, that I think are enhancing all of this. We have a program -- I didn't put it on here -- that we call voice of the associate, Kelly asked me to implement the last couple of years. I personally chair a call every quarter with all levels of associates in the company on an anonymous basis to really get at \"Do you have real concerns about risk issues, behavioral issues, ethics events? Are you comfortable escalating to management?\" We want to know what's going on all the way down into the company. It's been a very valuable process and, frankly, has done nothing more than reinforced to me how strong our culture is.</p><p>Another thing we've recently done is we've elevated to the highest level a new Culture and Conduct Risk Committee that's made up of most of the members of executive management. And again, the whole idea is to bring together the various programs we have around ethics and behavior, so that we can make sure that we never have any unintended consequences no matter how large that we grow.</p><p>And I would just leave you with this. While it may be self-evident that, that lowers things like compliance and reputational risk, frankly, it just lowers risk overall. If you have a strong culture, just -- you're going to have people doing the right thing.</p><p>So I want to spend the remaining amount of my time on, a certainly a timely topic around credit risk and our approach to lending, which has always been disciplined, relatively conservative but mostly very, very consistent.</p><p>So obviously, I've laid out the elements that are foundational to our winning approach around client selection, around just very strong transactional-based underwriting and then very, very disciplined portfolio and servicing.</p><p>So I want to give you a couple of thoughts around credit, where we are in the market. We've always had consistent performance. By the way, I laid out for you some data that you certainly could get yourself. But this looks at our results over really -- over the last 30 years or so. And certainly, we've outperformed on a risk-adjusted basis, both from a loss taking and a return standpoint. But what's really interesting is throughout the cycle, we will still outperform. But obviously, as you get potentially later in the stages of a cycle, you see a lot more convergence. And we're happy all the time tied to this level. There's very little differentiation in credit results right now, but I would remind you that the gray shading is the distribution of the results among the peers. So you can still see while the averages may not tell the whole story, you can see there's a wide degree of performance really in any year. And particularly as things turn, it gets much wider. So we're very mindful that while we're not calling any sort of late-stage cycle necessarily now, we do see a lot of behavior out there in underwriting and risk selection that this feels very characteristic of late-stage cycle dynamics. And we've listed some those there. Obviously, everybody's performance looks similar. There's an obsessive focus on revenue and growth. You don't hear a lot of talk about quality. You certainly are seeing loosening underwriting standards.</p><p>So obviously, we're mindful of that. But for BB&amp;T, the main message I want to give you is we don't go through risk-on and risk-off periods. We're always on. We're always focused on being consistent whatever the cycle is.</p><p>One of the ways we do that is a real obsession around diversification. So one of the things that Kelly and I put in when we came in, our roles was a rolling comprehensive 5-year target portfolio mix process. So we have a lot of work that goes into this around stress testing and performance review or we try to model what we think is an aspirational portfolio mix that we can lend into given the market opportunities. And what you can't see is substantial diversification since the Great Recession, and we're very close to where we think an ideal target mix would be. And again, what drives us is the goal toward lower variability, higher resiliency. So for us, that looks like a conscious effort over the years to reduce our relative CRE and ADC and resi mortgage concentrations and move toward a more granular C&amp;I and non-real estate consumer. And we're making great progress there. We think it'll yield excellent results. One of the ways that we drive that is through a very, very strong limits framework. So we have a myriad of ways that we segment the portfolio, both commercial and retail, and also a very, very intense focus on granularity through our single borrower and our single project or the individual limit for -- considerations.</p><p>So one of the things I thought would be helpful, today, we have a -- is to give you a little bit more color under the covers of what's in our portfolio. I get a lot of questions about that, and we certainly disclose a lot, but give you guys a few tidbits today we don't normally disclose.</p><p>Remind you all, our portfolio's $146 billion today. It's intentionally diversified between commercial and retail. But the point -- the takeaway here is even within commercial and retail, there's a lot of diversification whether it's in C&amp;I, CRE or on the retail side. And then geographically, with the complement of national businesses we have, particularly in the nonreal estate consumer, we're much more than the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic loan portfolio today. And that geographic diversification, I think, will serve us well as we look forward.</p><p>So I thought I'd dive down just little bit in the C&amp;I side, $62.5 billion. You can see no single-sector concentration, intentionally focused on diversification. A couple of things I'm quite proud of that I think are differentiated characteristics. We have a very conservative portfolio. Our average loan size in our C&amp;I book's less than $1 million. Our SNC book is less than 10% of our total loan portfolio.</p><p>Our top 20 relationship commitments are less than 35% of tangible common equity. Again, I would ask you to go back and see if anyone else is anywhere near that. I think we look really good from a concentration level.</p><p>Now I've listed out some of the things that we avoid, they're minimal exposure to leverage finance. And you can see things like second-liens, Term Bs, bridge financing, full underwriting. We just don't do those things in general. So again, our C&amp;I book's very diversified, very conservative. Similar on the CRE sides, average loan is under $2 million. Our largest single CRE credit's only $70 million. We just don't take big-project risk or large, significant exposures. And we're very diversified by the various MSAs.</p><p>Another thing that we do is very intentional about governing down CRE exposure limits. It's governed down from what we would do on the C&amp;I side and further limited by project type. Modest exposures on mall side, now that's probably a question you all have. And we are -- our loan sizing is more conservative. We use the stressed cash flow coverage, which can create higher debt yield requirements than most of our peers. And so we end up sizing our loans more conservatively to stress for interest shock.</p><p>All this financing get a lot of questions about regional acceptance. I thought I'd give you a little color there. Regional has been a strong performer for us for a number of years. We've learned the business the hard way. We've very sophisticated analytics. But more importantly, we combine that with very, very strong risk controls around the operational verifications and collateral assessments. You really need to do that in the nonprime side, but I'll just put some history here to show that -- it's interesting. These types of businesses tend to stress a little earlier, but they recover really quickly. We actually had some of the best performance we've ever had at regional coming through the crisis as a lot of prime borrowers fell down. But we're actually producing lower off of today substantially than a year ago. So we feel well positioned no matter what the cycle will be. This is a business we understand very well, but we're also not greedy about exposure levels. And so we keep a pretty tight limit on how much we will do even here, even though it's very attractive margins.</p><p>Resi mortgage and home equity or DRL, very conservative. You can see that we hold conforming loans, and we do jumbos for our wealth strategy. There's no particular concentrations there, very minimal precrisis exposure on the DRL side. This is all in the branch, direct-originated credits and branch where -- all very, very clean underwriting. We also have a fast-growing wealth lending segment that Rufus mentioned. Again, very attractive. So again, resi mortgage in our consumer book looks very, very good.</p><p>I would mention -- and I'll talk about this in a moment. We are not participating today in any sort of third-party unsecured lending platforms. We certainly are evaluating those, but we want to focus our consumer opportunities in cycle-tested businesses that we think have more attractive returns.</p><p>Our card side's -- really, we're selling cards to our clients. So this is a tidbit I'm very proud of. 70% of our bank card clients have 4 or more services. They are our clients. We're not doing any subprime or mass solicitation. So it's a really conservative book. Now it's going fast with new product opportunities. This is a huge competitive advantage here for us. We've worked for 20 or 25 years to make investments in a number of national prime-based specialty finance platforms. So let me say that again. These are not subprime platforms. These are prime-based, primarily small-ticket secured finance platforms. And I've listed those out. I know Rufus and Chris and Brant went over a lot of those. But I think the main takeaway for you all: highly diversified sets of proven cycle-tested business models. We would rather spend our time growing these methodically and deliberately than spending our time investing in unsecured lending right now.</p><p>And finally, I just want to end here, how do we look forward? What you can count on from BB&amp;T is to maintain that consistent disciplined through-the-cycle approach to credit risk management. We don't get in and out of lending. We're steady through the cycle, but we've also proven to you that because of all the diversified investments we've made, we have plenty of growth opportunities even with that approach. The way we're spending most -- more of our time, however, to which you heard earlier is how can we make the operational and client onboarding processes more efficient and a better user experience. So lots of good investments there. All of those also come with them new and improved risk controls.</p><p>I said it before, our investment bias right now on the lending side are proven through-the-cycle platforms. We think we're in a lot of nice businesses and very careful and deliberate evaluation of alternative credit delivery and origination platforms. But I think you will see us be very careful about jumping in too fast and too hard, particularly as this credit cycle goes forward in a longer fashion.</p><p>So again, risk management's more critical than ever. And I feel very, very good about our historical performance and our opportunities ahead. So thank you very much, and I'll now bring in Daryl.</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE, SENIOR EVP &amp; CFO, BB&amp;T CORPORATION: Every time I walk into this building, I see a big building, a lot of associates in it. But what I really see is the LED lighting and 25% lower utility bills. So I want to thank all of you for coming here to Greensboro. I know you took time out of your day and your week to come here, and I hope you've found this to be very helpful.</p><p>But we're almost done. After me, we're going to have a short break. And then Kelly's going to come up, and we're going do Q&amp;A. So I'm going to try to close this up and maybe try to pick up a little bit of time.</p><p>So what we're trying to do. My key takeaways are trying to grow organically through geography and diversification, delivering top-tier quartile profitability, also using optimal capital management and using best-in-class shareholder returns.</p><p>You've heard a lot of things about associates, culture and business strategy today. All those elements work well together at BB&amp;T such that we provide the best return to shareholders in the sector. We have a strong history of consistent performance. To produce leading and sustainable returns to shareholders, we've grown our business within our risk appetites, driven by diversified, strong market share across businesses and markets. We've done it through leading profitability, and we've managed it through capital formation and in the best interest of our shareholder.</p><p>Organic growth is our top priority. As you've heard from everyone today, we are growing our client base quite well. We are very well-positioned in the markets we serve, with leading market share and strong local presence.</p><p>Our markets are smaller on average than our peers. We like that. Our Community Banking model works really good in these markets. We're localized, and the client loyalty factor is stronger.</p><p>Chris showed you earlier our footprint on average is growing faster than our peers, which provides a great opportunity for us to grow the business. We like the diversity of the markets. David went over this earlier. Texas, Carolina and Florida are growing much faster while Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are growing slower. Actually, West Virginia is one of our most profitable markets. We have found success in each market, and we like the balance.</p><p>Again, organic growth is a top priority for us. As Clarke said, we won't sacrifice our well-defined credit discipline that has served us well for many decades. We don't try to time cycles. We stick to our risk parameters. It's just our culture.</p><p>Our markets are a great backdrop to support the organic growth but it's also the diversity of our business. Brant, David, Rufus and John told you a lot about their business today. But when you put them together, you create great synergies, diversification that drives consistent and prudent growth.</p><p>As Chris went over, we operate in a 15-state branch footprint, complemented by many national businesses.</p><p>We're a balance between spread and fee income. We have a loan portfolio that's about half commercial and half retail, with sectors and geographies that are spread out and diverse.</p><p>As Rufus said, our insurance or our wealth management business has significant upside. As John said, our insurance business brokerage is a pure fee income business and advisory business that takes no underwriting risk. It has been core to BB&amp;T for many decades. Insurance has been set up to provide cross-sell with our blank clients and with its own business. It is also balanced: 50%, retail; and 50%, wholesale and stress-tests very well with CCAR.</p><p>As John said, the public markets attribute a very high valuation to insurance brokers for good reason. They have very strong cash flows with limited capital use and, in this case, very synergistic with the rest of our businesses. Diversity of our businesses contributed to leading performance historically and will continue to do so going forward.</p><p>You heard from Clarke today about our risk culture. It's a culture that has resulted from our outperformance for a long time. Our business model has resulted in relatively granular loan portfolio versus peers.</p><p>A much greater percentage of our commercial loans are smaller exposures. You can see this in the last Moody's report that shows us second out of 67 banks that participated in the survey. We did not -- we do not take large positions just to grow our loan percentages. We are community bank driven, and we don't compromise on our standards. Lastly, Gerard's ratio, the Texas ratio, recognizes the success of our risk culture.</p><p>We've always been and remain focused in achieving best-in-class shareholder returns. As Chris showed you earlier, we have industry-leading return metrics and are focused at maintaining competitive position through a variety of economic backdrops.</p><p>Our net interest margin benefits from balance sheet mix and diversity but more so, the stability of our net interest margin relative to peers illustrates our balanced approach.</p><p>We are focused at growing earnings consistently through different cycles, not when rates are moving in one direction. Half of our loan book is fixed. The other half is floating, plus we use a prudent use of derivatives to manage the position.</p><p>Our strong return metrics are the result of many items we've discussed and will discuss further. These are leading industry returns across cycles and are clear driver for top-tier profitability.</p><p>The continued focus on solid expense management has driven strong shareholder returns. We have generated positive operating leverage each quarter this year and have committed to maintaining that discipline in 2019 and beyond.</p><p>Our strong culture of expense management has led to ratios that continued to trend downward meaningfully below peers. We have managed to do this without compromising BB&amp;T's client experience. As Dont\u00c3\u00a1 showed you, our NPS ratio is moving up.</p><p>Chris showed you earlier that we have many programs going on to drive efficiency and enhance revenue. You heard from John, Brant, David and Barbara show you how they are transforming their businesses, improving margins and having better efficiency and productivity. BB&amp;T has financial flexibility to make the necessary investments in the new bank, and we are confident we will lead to improving overall shareholder returns.</p><p>Our funding base is a key competitive advantage for us. We have transformed the right-hand side of the balance sheet materially over the last 10 years. When I joined the company almost 11 years ago, we were in last place in our peer group as DDA as a percent of total deposits. We're now approaching the top quartile. This is attributable to the hard work of Dona, who used to run deposits and now is our Treasurer; as well as Rufus, Brant and David to create products and grow relationships. On average, BB&amp;T clients have had their account with us 10 years on the retail side and 8 years on the commercial side.</p><p>Looking back post-bank acquisitions, DDA growth has been positive for us while negative for peers. As you have heard from others, we are focused on providing the best client experience for them while providing convenience, which leads to long-term relationships. Our strong credit metrics profitability combined with different -- diversified business markets plus capital liquidity and great performance over the many economic cycles have been well received by the rating agencies. BB&amp;T has some of the highest long-term ratings in the sector. These ratings help reduce funding costs, maintain strong deposit relationships and enhance profitability. While our top priority is strong growing core deposit base, we continue to have a presence in the corporate debt markets. The charts on this slide illustrate a strong performance of BB&amp;T and the compression of our debt levels versus similarly rated peers. Fixed income investors have awarded us with strong debt spreads as they recognize the strength and profitability of BB&amp;T.</p><p>Optimizing capital has always been a priority for BB&amp;T, and we will continue to hold the right amount of capital relative to our risk appetite. Peer levels have come down over the last several years while we have maintained ours at a constant level while maintaining industry-leading returns. As you know, our performance for 2008 stress testing was very positive, representative of a strong and resilient PPNR aided by insurance brokerage business and diverse and granular credit portfolio.</p><p>As you have heard from Kelly, organic growth is our top priority. We have been clear on our priorities. Second is strong dividend payout, and last is share buyback and strategic opportunities.</p><p>Our capital levels are adequate to support and drive organic growth. We have always paid a strong dividend, and we have every intention to maintain a payout in the 40% to 50% of earnings. Share buybacks and strategic opportunities have helped drive earnings per share growth and will support organic growth and dividends to produce consistent strong overall returns. We expect that these strategies will produce 8% to 12% annualized returns to shareholders.</p><p>As you have likely seen, the Fed recently proposed changes to our regulatory framework. There still has to be work done before these changes are finalized but we view these as very positive. We believe, if enacted, that these changes will be positive for BB&amp;T and for the sector in general. The benefits for us are meaningful when we cross over $250 billion in assets.</p><p>Cost avoidance by not having to implement the advanced approach is really big. AOCI really free up capital that can be used in the third bucket for buyback and strategic opportunities. We are not sure yet how CCAR '19 will be structured or whether will be part of the stress test process, but we plan to have an aggressive share buyback.</p><p>Given our LCR ratio is approximately 130, we plan to bring it down approximately to 115 over the next year or so. The plans to do this will be by not reinvesting cash flows, which will help fund loan growth and take pressure off of deposit betas. This will increase net interest margins and will also grow a net interest income with a relatively flat balance sheet.</p><p>Incremental share repurchases will be about $1 billion more than what you would typically see out of us over a CCAR year, resulting in solid shareholder returns. Lastly, Don and I believe that this strategy will be much more efficient and a much more profitable balance sheet.</p><p>BB&amp;T shareholders have received a compelling total shareholder return over the long run. The chart on the right shows our performance since pre-crisis, which utterly compares quite favorably. Many of you in the room and listening have owned our shares over this period and have experienced the appreciation. We thank you for your support. The earnings profile of our company has allowed us to build tangible book per share at a faster rate than peers while maintaining a strong return on capital to shareholders.</p><p>As we turn the page to 2019, we are optimistic on the economy and the landscape that we believe will translate into another solid year for BB&amp;T. Our outlook for '19 is based on a few conservative assumptions, which are outlined on the left-hand side of the page. We expect the balance sheet and revenue growth to be in the 2% to 4% range. Credit will continue to be relatively benign and estimate 30 to 50 basis points in net charge-offs. We expect expenses to be flat at $6.8 billion, excluding merger and restructuring charges, for a third year in a row, which will provide another year of positive operating leverage.</p><p>We believe that these are realistic numbers that we can achieve, and we are already in the midst of executing on this plan.</p><p>The last slide brings it all together. As you think about our long-term targets, the message is clear. We have delivered our goals across the cycles and expect to continue to do so. Our outlook has improved for profitability metrics since our last Investor Day. We expect a 12% to 15% return on equity, 19% to 20% return on tangible equity and a 1.4% to 1.7% return on assets, our best-in-class, charge-offs to normalize in the 40 to 60 basis points range. We expect to achieve returns generating 3% to 5% revenues -- revenue growth, consistently maintaining positive operating leverage, and we are planning to target a CET1 ratio of 9.5% to 9.75%.</p><p>In summary, we are very excited about the outlook and our ability to deliver on these targets. So the takeaways from this is we are continuing to grow organic growth through revenue and geography and diversification, delivering top-tier profitability, optimizing capital, producing best-in-class returns. Given I have about 5 minutes left, I had to take a few minutes to talk about CECL.</p><p>First, BB&amp;T is on track to implement the standard as required in 2020. We are testing our models and need to finalize certain assumptions that are inputs to the model, but we are on track to go into parallel in mid-2019.</p><p>As we have built the models, test results show that CECL is more pro-cyclical than the current method used today. These models have been built for stress testing and modified for CECL and are the most scrutinized models. Our stress testing models have hundreds of pages of documentation and have been reviewed by second-line, third-line regulators and auditors. Preliminary tests show that these models are fit-for-purpose and have been back-tested using historical information.</p><p>When CECL was first approved, it was more of an academic review, and the study assumed perfect foresight in the economy. The BPI study that was recently issued mirrors how the models actually work in the CECL environment. In a benign environment, you can see that the total reserves are about the same. However, the commercial reserves are much lower while the consumer reserves are much higher.</p><p>In an adverse environment, you can really see the pro-cyclicality of the reserves. The residential mortgage reserves are up 3.5x and the consumer reserves are approximately double. This creates large earnings volatility, depletes capital and establishes a strong disincentive to win in this stressed economic environment.</p><p>Moody's Analytics is a very good economic forecasting group. However, it is impossible to truly predict the future. As you can see, in 2007 and '08, Moody's did not call further recession. As recession played out, they continued to underestimate the magnitude. However, just when the recession was bottoming, was when they threw in the towel and the recession was going to get worse. You can see the impact on the residential mortgage portfolio. As we have discussed, these are quantitative results with no qualitative adjustments.</p><p>However, you have to remember what was going on in 2009. You had JPMorgan saving Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual. We had Wells saving Wachovia, PNC saving National City and Lehman failing. I ask you, what regulator is going to allow you to adjust your model results downward with the qualitative adjustment?</p><p>Coincidentally, in August of '09, BB&amp;T was successful in winning a competitive bid from the FDIC at Colonial. We priced the loan book at a 37% discount. After many years, the economy improved and actual losses came in closer to the low 20s.</p><p>This is another example of how markets overreact in economic stress. Because the economics of lending has been detached from the accounting, it makes it harder for banks to lend to small businesses and nonprime clients.</p><p>The slide shows you an example of our subprime auto portfolio where we book reserves now that we expect to have in 1 year. Given CECL, that impact the reserves more than double, which will make it very challenging to make these loans when you're losing money and capital. This hurts the most vulnerable sector of the economy.</p><p>So what can we do about this? All banks have sent in letters for a pause in the study of the procyclicality. In fact, it can easily adapt stress-testing models for CECL, and we expect to produce similar results.</p><p>Also, 21 banks have said into FASB recently a CECL alternative that builds on its strengths but addresses regional banks' largest concerns. It's a 3-bucket approach where bad loans and 1 year of losses from the good loans will be booked into income, with the rest being booked in OCI. This fits nicely with the Fed's NPR on capital that changes -- that basically backs out OCI for regulatory capital. This significantly reduces the income volatility associated with CECL and approaches and aligns better with the international standards. Investors will have a visibility in the potential losses of this loan book. BB&amp;T supports this approach. We thought it was important for you to show what we're seeing as we roll out CECL and the potential impact on the capital and the system.</p><p>So before I -- so let me wrap it up. So to wrap it up, you heard today the vision for the future and why we are so confident we can continue to build our success and deliver top-tier returns across the cycle. Our goals remain simple and unchanged for decades. We will grow the company prudently. We will do so with leading profitability, and we'll manage our capital to help continue to drive shareholder returns across the cycles.</p><p>Before I turn it back to Rich, I just want to thank some people that basically put on this Investor Day. As you know, doing this is a huge, huge effort. First, people I'd like to thank is Alan and Rich who investor relations. The effort and the leadership they put in this was really big. Also part of their team, there is [Kristina Cheryl] who is here somewhere. She does all the presentations. And I would tell you a story. We got all these presentations about a month ago, and it was great presentations but they were all great individual presentation.</p><p>She spent the last month putting them all together, making them all look alike and flow together. So I give her a great, great effort and gratitude for what she did there. Others in IR that helped out were [Richard, Carla and Jonathan]. And then, in IT to help get everything working for this day, Ken Daniels and [April Starling]. The others that really helped on this, today is -- so as we were putting all the presentations together, we were meeting in the evenings about every other day for about 3 weeks. And my team that's sitting up here in the back, our Corporate Controller, Cindy; and [Hank Serpy], our Assistant Controller; Dale Davies, he's in Corporate Finance and [Erron Ryder]. And then, Hope [Vinchowsky]. Hope got the job of actually going back to each of these executive managers saying, \"We're changing it here or we want to do this over here.\" and did a great job. And executive managers got a little tired of Hope, but I think it all worked out okay.</p><p>The last group I want to tell you -- that really helped us out is not a BB&amp;T group. It is somebody that I worked with for 25 years, and it's basically a banking team. And it's really -- they're here today over -- there is [Vini and Jason Bernstein], and their team is [Eric and Sabrina]. They really helped us work and pull us together. They're just part of our team, and I want to thank -- thank you for all their efforts in pulling this off.</p><p>And with that, I will turn it back to Rich.</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: Thank you, Daryl. Just a reminder, I did get a question earlier. We're going to have the shuttles leave at 3:15, one for the airport and one for the Leadership Institute. I had a question about what that shuttle going to Leadership Institute, what time it would get to the airport. Think about 4 to 4:15, but maybe, plan on 4:15, in case you have flights that are leaving shortly after 5. We're going to take a break now, and we're going to start back promptly at 12 -- I'm sorry, 2:30 with the Q&amp;A session with executive management. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: Get started. You've been very patient and have to allow us -- now we're going to -- our first question. Okay, good. So before we get to first question, I want to recognize [Tina Folough] wherever she is. She's been the event planner, and she's done a lot for us. So Tina, thank you so much. So we have our first question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>GEOFFREY ELLIOTT, PARTNER, REGIONAL AND TRUST BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Geoff Elliott, Autonomous Research. So you've got this news about the $250 billion threshold very likely going away, assuming the NPR proceeds as proposed. And you've also talked quite a lot about the investments you are making in technology. So it kind of feels if you take those two together, you've got a regulatory environment that supports acquisitions and you've got investments, which can be scaled over a bigger asset base. But you sounded a little bit more downbeat on M&amp;A on the most recent quarter. How do we square those things together and how do we think about the inorganic growth strategy?</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: Yes, so you've heard all day today my associates talk about a variety of really, really good and, I think, very exciting strategic organic growth plans. Most of the technological investments you've heard about are either to make the background more efficient, more effective or enable the front room, the new bank, as we talk about it, the new digital strategies. And so all of that is supporting organic growth. As I have said repeatedly, we are laser focused on organic growth. We have made major investments on behalf of our shareholders over the last several years to prepare us to get really good returns off of those investments. And we frankly think it's time for us to generate returns off of those investments for our shareholders. So we are laser-focused on organic growth. I hope you heard that very clearly from our team today, and that's where our focus is.</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: Yes.</p><p>MICHAEL LAWRENCE MAYO, MD, HEAD OF U.S. LARGE-CAP BANK RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike Mayo. It's Wells Fargo Securities. Plus thank you for the day. In Boston last week, we heard about 15 bank presentations. This might be about the fifth Investor Day many of us have been to this year. And some of what we've heard seems really different, but some of it doesn't seem as different than some other banks. And you're saying you're a different bank. We've heard some examples. If we could just maybe go down the line. If you had to pick one aspect that you think where BB&amp;T is really different, what's that one aspect that you'd highlight maybe in each of the different areas?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Just go right down the line, okay? So I would say it's really culture that we have was management (inaudible). So I would say, one differentiating factor is the management. We've spoken last night to a couple of investors, but the team that we have here assembled, there's a lot of us that have worked together for a while. There's some younger ones. They have good growth potential. But we are all focused and trying to achieve the best thing for the company and the shareholder in the long run. So everybody is aligned for that one goal and is really focused on that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. That's obviously the first one always. But I would say diversification. You asked me last night, I said diversification. You said that's boring, and I said that's good. So I would say diversification that keeps -- its works in good and bad times.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think from a risk management standpoint, the #1 differentiator is the risk culture. We live and breathe a risk culture every day, and I think that's demonstrated in the results, not put ours up against anyone's.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would say -- the item that I shared with you on a co-creation. They're having a 40 professionals, 7 PhDs. They're co-creating real-time with our client that's making a meaningful difference, allows us make iterative changes in a more positive way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think from a branch network perspective, the way we go to market is differentiated. The integrated approach that comes through our community bank strategy that's been around for 30 years, where our retail branch teams are connected to all the other lines of business and support our clients in an integrated way is a key differentiator.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would say in our business, it's an unwavering commitment to evolve the business to do the tough things, to move the business forward so that we can very productively serve the client in a very, very efficient way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think in the corporate institution wealth businesses, we have never chased the market. We've never gone after the hot product. We've never gone after the stretch structure and that leaves us strategically positioned to really gain share because of credibility but also we're underweight. We are still underweight with the businesses that I represent. There's material growth opportunity out there for us in the marketplace.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: As new to the financial division, I would agree. It's really all about our culture.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Mike, I'd say it's our insurance business. No other bank in the United States has an insurance business anything like ours. We are the largest bank-owned insurance broker, and we're about 20x the size of the second largest bank-owned insurance broker.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You saw on full display last night our leadership Institute. It's a differentiator, we deliver that to our clients and it's unique. We've been doing it for now 4 decades. And you just can't turn that switch on. It's here to stay, and it's a real differentiator for BB&amp;T.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Mike, I think it's our focus on execution and continuous improvement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll just add for our transformation and technology that we've been putting together. One of the things I talked to our associates about is that you ever seen the movie, The Greatest Showman, one of the songs in there is called A Million Dreams. And really, the transformation that we -- and journey that we are on really came from the goals and hopes and dreams of our technology associates and what they actually want to do, and it's really the power of the associates actually coming together with their dreams about how a technology organization should run to be able to deliver to these teams. And so it's the million dreams of our associates coming together.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Mike, I'd say, as you've heard already, it's the diversification. It's the risk culture that we've set for ourselves, the steady risk appetite that we've maintained for a long time, and really, just sticking to that appetite.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So just follow-up, Mike. (inaudible) the right and Donna -- the culture is the difference. That's how we spent so much time last night. But I get your point, a lot of the strategies that while they're new and different for us, a lot of other companies have a lot of planned strategies. So I get your point. But the real difference, other than the philosophy, the culture at BB&amp;T, is about our -- what we call integrated relationship management and our integrated leadership approach. This group of people meets every Monday for a number of hours, sometimes all day, integrating all of our strategies. So it's ultimately about execution. Everybody can have great strategy concepts, but it's all about execution. At BB&amp;T, because we are so tightly woven, we share everything all the time. The team gets along great. It's all about execution, and that's about integrated relationship management to the client and then integrated leadership thinking at the corporate level.</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: Yes.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI, SENIOR MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Just back to the M&amp;A question. I know you just said you're laser-focused organically, and what you spend here is positioned better for that. In your mind, is there a change? Is that a change in how you think about M&amp;A versus a year ago? I mean, are you thinking now, given all this investment, given the investment you need to do and what technologies that you just are not as interested in M&amp;A as you were previously.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, in terms of perspective, M&amp;A has been a part of our strategy for a long, long time. About 3 years or so ago, we did 3 mergers. I've said at that time, we were going on a self-imposed pause, and not relieve that pause. And I have further explained that we are dramatically focused on organic growth. And I've further said that, frankly, doing deals in today's environment is extraordinarily difficult. The world has not caught up with the reality in terms of the economics of all the changes we have talked about. So number one, we've got a lot on our plate; number two, we're laser-focused on organic growth; number three, the economics conditions emerges anyway; and number four, nothing is fundamental changed. I've been saying the same thing all along.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI: And then one follow-up on capital, if I could. On the CET1 target of 9.5% to 9.75% that previously was 10%. Is that -- is there opportunity to continue to push that lower -- I know it's your updated long-term target, but given the changing regulatory environment, can that go lower?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So our current CET1 is 10.2%, and we have kind of constant around there, and we had kind of say that was kind of our level. It's a very conservative level. But what we talked about, as we contemplate next year's CCAR, assuming that (inaudible) CCAR but in our next year's submission, which we now finalize, the forces, as we head into end of the year. But we think that 50 to 75 or so basis points that we can release relative to these changes given our very low risk profile.</p><p>KENNETH MICHAEL USDIN, MD AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Just two expense questions. First is maybe for Barbara as well, the context of keeping expenses flat as you talked about obviously, savings and funding the investments. Can you just help us understand how much is the investments growing versus what your kind of self-help is in terms of balancing that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So the way I would answer that is we are basically taking away expenses out of the old bank, other than branches. We're consolidating back offices, reduction and enforcing individuals, utilities, whatever, and we are redeploying it into the new bank. And new bank includes digital, includes a lot of the projects that Barbara was talking about in IT, and also includes some revenue enhancement, new products and services and all that stuff, marketing as well, increasing our marketing budget. So all that's pulled together. If we actually look at the IT budget, she's probably going to be flat to up. But one of her transformations is really getting to be more productive</p><p>BARBARA F. DUCK: Absolutely. One of the things that we're focused on, when I talked about lean process, automation, and you think about the ability to take out or do additional work, around 10% to 15% additional work, so you certainly can make choices about whether you take that pause out or whether you redeploy and do new initiatives. So again, our goal is to make sure that we are as efficient and effective as we can be. And then, as we do that and free up dollars, we can look to see how we either reinvest that back into the technology part to support what the teams are doing or if we need to reduce expenses, then we certainly can do that as well. But at least we have the financial flexibility with the activities that we're doing to reinvest in the way that's most appropriate for the company.</p><p>KENNETH MICHAEL USDIN: And then, Daryl, just my follow-up on that didn't can give an explicit efficiency ratio target. You talked about positive operating leverage. I'm just wondering if you can just help us understand just what your general thought process of where efficiency should go in the future from the 57 and change.</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: Do you want to go? (inaudible)</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE: So I mean, if you look at '19, we didn't give a specific efficiency number target, but if we can grow the revenue in the 2% to 4% range and keep expenses flat, we're going to be in the mid-50s. When you get out beyond 2019, how much efficiency and operating leverage you can get. It's probably not expenses flat but expense basically -- maybe expenses growing 2% and revenue growing 3% to 5%. Hopefully, we can continue to improve upon that efficiency ratio.</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: And remember, when you're making comparisons to us to other to institutions, there's a couple of hundred basis points inflation in that, if you will, for insurance business, which is very, very profitable. So if you think about where we are today, we're really all ready to adjust for insurance. We're already in that 55 kind of level, so if you adjust for insurance, we've, as Daryl say, we could say our share is going below mid-50s, but a lot of that depends on the revenues. So the [efficiency] ratio, I know we all like to talk about a lot, but it's very tricky. Nevertheless, over the years, most of us have improved our efficiency ratio by controlling expenses with very meager revenue growth. If we go through a period with more normalized revenue growth, there's lots of potential.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets. Coming back to the differentiation question. You pointed out others have similar products as yourselves. We heard last week at the [bab] -- a lot of digital talk and data and all that stuff for many of your peers. You had a point yet with this differentiation will allow you to charge higher prices for products or pay lower rates on deposits or are we just not there yet where customers come to expect this type of service but you really can't price up for or benefit from a -- in from a pricing standpoint? And (inaudible) monetize it yet?</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: Well, yes, in some cases, in some cases, no. So one of the great challenges that companies have banks of today is to take pick the areas that they can really create through differentiation and where they really cannot. I mean, It's nice for everybody to say, \"Look, all of our products are better than everybody else.\" That's really not true. I mean, we can't out credit card JPMorgan or Capital One. We have a good credit card product array, but we can't say our credit cards are better than theirs. Where we can outperform in terms of quality small business, medium-size business, there are aspects of our corporate banking business, our wealth banking business. We have our insurance business. So yes, we have a number of product areas, which are truly unique and/or differentiable. And we can get a price, we do get a price advantage. And -- but there are some that are trickier because they're more commodity-like and it's more difficult to get the price advantage.</p><p>BETSY LYNN GRASECK, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions. One, just a quick follow-up on the capital where you're taking out 50 to 70 basis points for next -- for long term. Does that -- does it matter if the NPR goes through or not? So if NPR does go through that happens, if it does not go through?</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE: So we really don't want to start lowering the capital ratio and so we make sure that the rule is actually pass as a freeze-up deal of the OCI Capital. One thing that would be clear, so I had a question between the break on this is if like this year's CCAR was a normal CCAR cycle for us, so our dividend payout was in around 40% range and then we have our share buyback. Our share buyback was 1.7 that we used approximately 300 to 400 (inaudible) on the insurance transaction. So when I talked about in the presentation an additional billion, it's equivalent to like having 2.7 in buyback from CCAR '19 plays out. And that's a approximation.</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: So to be clear, because this is very confusing. In today's world, pre-NPL, pre-CECL, pre-anything else, the minimum level of capital that we have to have is 7%. So if you start from there and you say, \"Well, we're pretty conservative. We'd like to have 150 basis points or so just to operate the business without -- because they fell below 7%, bad things happen.\" You have to (inaudible) and so forth. So that gets you 8.5%. And well, yes, but you're 8.5% to 10.2% the long way. Well, then you -- right now, we're having to hold back 100 basis points because of 250. You got questions about CECL, which may or may not impact that. We don't think it will. And then you want to also think about how you feel about the economy and other factors as you look forward. So we factor all of that in. And so today, we've said we were comfortable in the 10-ish range, so if you assume all of that stays the same, which it could turn but if it stays the same, then that gets you down to that 9.5% level post NPL.</p><p>BETSY LYNN GRASECK: Got it, okay. And then, just another question on the expense side. I think, John, you mentioned in your presentation on the insurance segment that you're interested in getting up that right-hand piece of the pie, the net profit. So maybe you could give us a little bit of a sense as to how much room there is there, what kind of timeframe we're talking about and is that over and above the expense outlook, Daryl, that you have -- does insurance -- is insurance one of those levers or does the insurance stand alone? So maybe, John, you could</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE: So Betsy, the guidance that I gave definitely includes and embeds what John is talking about. Everything that Barbara, Brant, David, everybody's doing with all these projects that Chris talked about is all embedded in the guidance that we gave. So obviously, John, the operating margins are going to go up, which is part of that.</p><p>JOHN MICHAEL HOWARD: So in terms of increasing the net income slice of the pie in the chart on the right. When I talk about our transformation and the 31-plus initiatives that we have there, all designed to do that through a combination of increasing efficiency, reducing expenses, improving organic growth. One of the ways that we went about the project was to look at our starting EBITDA margin. That's a common metric for insurance brokers. And we compared where we were to where our peers were, and we were lower than they were in terms of EBITDA margin. So the plan that we put together was to get to a peerish EBITDA margin over a 3-year period of time. Our peer's EBITDA margins will also change, of course. They're all working on improving theirs. But if you look at the improvement, it's significant. And should probably, I'd imagine, stay away from exact numbers, but it's a pretty considerable profitability improvement.</p><p>BETSY LYNN GRASECK: Okay, thanks. And then just one last one for Barbara. Maybe you could talk a little about some of the opportunities that you have for pulling back on some of the IT spend. I know that overall, the budget is flat to up and we talked a lot about some of the investments spend that you're making in the platform. But it would be helpful to understand where there are opportunities for IT to get more efficient.</p><p>BARBARA F. DUCK: So the primary areas when you think about the spend that we have, we have about 40% to 50% of our spend is in what we call labor spend. And so whether that be direct associate cost or contractors or offshore, and so the key for us is making sure in those areas that we are being as efficient as we can, whether it's making sure what we call smart sourcing, whether we source from the right vendor at the right time, also making sure that we are as efficient as we can across that large population of associates and how they do work. So that's a large lever for us to make sure that we're most efficient at. And then, the other area I would say is when you look at the other portions of expense, have to do with large contracts, large equipment that we have to do and so making sure that our contracts and relationships that we have with vendors, whether it be software or hardware, that we are optimizing that spend as well and being very considerate of the length of terms of contracts and the costs associated with those large spend that we have in the infrastructure space.</p><p>LANA CHAN, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Lana Chan from BMO Capital Markets. Daryl, the revenue target that you gave for next year 2019, does that embed higher rates for the rate hikes?</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE: Yes. Good question, Lana. So what we have in our forecast right now is that the fed will move in December. And we have a move, I think, in March or April, and then one in, maybe, September timeframe. So two moves in '19. Curve moving up slightly but nothing too dramatically in that period.</p><p>LANA CHAN: And does it embed the potential benefit from the LCR moving down?</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE: It does. So with us keeping the balance sheet relatively flat, so if it works, see how it plays out. But as security cash flows pay off, if we put loans on, you're probably going to increase 150 to 300 basis point higher yielding return on that marginal asset. And that's really how we're going to get some relief on not having to fund, so a little bit less deposit pressure but also higher yields on your overall earning assets.</p><p>MATTHEW D. O'CONNOR, MD, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. I want to ask about loan growth. And I guess the crux of the question is, why are you not more optimistic on the loan growth outlook for 2% to 4%? And I guess, the context I'll put in is -- on the one hand, I appreciate that you don't want to overpromise on loan growth when there's not much in the industry right now. On the other hand, as I heard from all your business line heads, there's a lot of initiatives underway to grow whether it's large corporate, extend in auto, the Marine. It seems like the runoff portfolio is largely done across the portfolio. You're in faster growth markets. You're more diversified. So how do we reconcile what it feels like it should be a bigger loan growth opportunity with a guidance and maybe part getting in the way?</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: Let me make a comment and then some of my colleagues can fill in. [indiscernible. So we're conservative, and our portfolio has been through an inflection point this year, as you alluded to, in the mortgage portfolio and auto portfolio. And even though you may have -- from trough to peak, you would have higher percentage growth rates from average to average because those are going (inaudible) this year. That makes it difficult in terms of growth even though it's stabilized. So it's mathematically -- that's some of it. And to be honest, we're still trying to figure out right now where we're going in the market. We're going to the accelerated levels of payoffs that we had. I mean, they've been pretty brutal for the last 3 quarters. When we went to stabilize it, which it will if rates continue to drift up. If at some point, there's permanent type product goes out into the marketplace you will see how our growth rates. So I think we're trying to be conservative and reflect the math of some of the change in our portfolios. But you're right, all of these strategies you heard about are very bullish when you go to loan growth. Any comments?</p><p>DARYL N. BIBLE: The only thing that I would say is the last 2 years, we've grown loans year-over-year 2.4% 2 years ago. We'll be about 2% this year. So if we get 3-plus percent next year, that's over a 50% increase.</p><p>SAUL MARTINEZ, MD &amp; ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Saul Martinez, UBS. One of the theme is today's disrupt-or-die, and you've been speaking about that for a while. But can you talk a little bit more about what exactly you mean by disruption, where you see the threats of disruption from both Fintech and big tech as well? And everything you do as a bank, whether it's lending, facilitating payments, deposit products, where do you see the biggest threats of insurgence coming in and eating away at the economic value? And conversely, where do you see the opportunities to maybe partner with these players and to provide some of those technologies and capabilities at scale?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LEE HENSON: So the threat is not coming as much specifically from an individual Fintech or Fintechs. It's coming from this conceptual change that I've described of realtime demand. So the marketplace has moved to where they have a dramatic different expectation in terms of delivery of all products from services, and especially, in the consumer space. And so in order to comply, we have to build this new bank. In order to build a new bank, we have to disrupt the old bank. So it's not an immediate threat from any individual company, it's more of a conceptual understanding that the marketplace has changed and it impacts delivery of all of our products and services. So I would say, what we're trying to do is take a broad-based foundational conceptual approach to dismantling, disrupting, whatever term you want to use, building the new bank so they have a really strong foundation for the future. And to be honest, we're not particularly concerned about any individual Fintech. I personally think that the Fintechs have added some value to our industry, and that they have provided some stimulus in terms of focusing on times. On the other hand, if you ask me am I particularly concerned about them and airily being our problem, I would tell you, I'm a lot more concerned about other things than that.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WILLIAM MARINAC, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, FIG PARTNERS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Chris Marinac with FIG Partners from Atlanta. You've mentioned earlier today about the stake portfolio having opportunity to grow. I think it's roughly $50 million, average size. Is that a incremental source of growth next year or would that be more significant in terms of how we get to the 2% to 4% growth?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure. I would say, it is an incremental growth. I mean, as we up to hear -- what our intent is, just to increasingly become more important to the clients we already have and introduce net new clients, which comes through our expansion strategies. It's broadly nationally in our markets. But as each -- as the revolvers, as the structures come due, we are critically looking at where is the appropriate tiering level for us. So you get an organic uplift out of those as well as adding net new clients. So I will say it would be intentional.</p><p>RICHARD BAYTOSH: We've got time for one more question.</p><p>JAMES HANNA, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, MILLENNIUM MANAGEMENT LLC: This is Jimmy Hanna. I've been to one or two of these Investor Days. And I'll just echo what Daryl said, really well put together. I've got Investor Days for banks, payment networks, credit card companies, trust banks, this is one of the better Investor Days I've seen, so thank you for putting it together. The question for Kelly on culture. As you think about growing this bank from 1995, 36th largest by market cap, and then, you think about, today 9th largest bank. Over that time -- where have there been challenges in keeping the culture consistent and how would you -- what are your learnings for the next 10 years?</p><p>KELLY STUART KING: Jimmy, that's a really, really insightful question. And we have learned some things. There is no doubt that as you get larger in terms of number of associates, more geographically widespread, continuing the culture becomes more challenging. And the reason is this. Continuing your culture, building a culture is about teaching beliefs. It's a backdrop leadership model of belief change behaviors, behaviors create results. So culture is all about building a consistent array of beliefs to support what you're trying to accomplish. And that's really about one-on-one and group type of interactions in terms of conveying what the belief is all about. There's a lot of scientific knowledge about actually changing beliefs. I actually did a thesis on it a long time ago and changing someone's belief is actually about the consistent conveyance of credible information by a powerful source over a reasonable period of time. So bottom line, I tell our folks that you have to preach and teach a lot. And so what we've learned is we had to ramp up the amplitude of our efforts in terms of making sure because all of a sudden, we look around and say, we add 5,000 new associates every year. So just because we've got it in our blood, they are new to the company, so we have built-in indoctrination cultural initiatives in the hiring process, the onboarding process. Last year, all of our executives spread out, we held I think about 60 to 70 events all around the country, a several-hour cultural event. I do a quarterly video that goes to every single associate where we talk about a lot of things, including the culture. Next year we'll going to do a whole another round of cultural events all around the country where we'll again go over and over and over the culture. So it's kind of like when you're raising your kids, you know you have to kind of keep telling them to do this, and don't do that a lot, and changing belief in a company is no different. So people ask me, can you do it as you got larger? The answer to that's -- but you have to be really committed. The CEO and the executive team have to spend a lot of time and then it filters down and then you keep reinforcing. A really, really good question.</p><p>So we are out of time. I want to also thank you all for coming. You've been very patient and very nice. You -- most of you -- I think all of you have supported us for a long, long time. We really, really appreciate it. But what you have heard us say is that BB&amp;T is a different bank, in fact, we are a different kind of company. We are a company that is really focused on accomplishing our why. Our why at BB&amp;T is to make a world better place to live. We're really serious about that. Now we know we've made loans and deposits in [FTEs] and we know we need to make money, we know we need to get the stock price up and all that. But to be honest, that's not what we get excited about. What we get excited about is making the world a better place to live and in doing so, we end up accomplishing the objective for all of the constituents that support our organization. So we are a very value-driven organization, we're a very cultural-driven organization. That is the differentiator, as we responded earlier, in terms of BB&amp;T. What you've heard today is our recognition that the world has changed. It has really changed big time, especially over the last 3 years or so. We believe it is necessary to respond to that change, and that change involves building effectively a new bank because the world now has realtime demand for satisfying their needs. And that's why we're seeing so many traditional retailers go by the wayside because new entrants have, in fact, created a new supply capability that they have not been willing or able to respond to. We are not going to die, we are going to disrupt. And as one of my associates like to say, [Jelace Vedder] say, disrupt to thrive. I kind of like that. And so that's really what we're doing, we're disrupting to thrive. And we believe all the strategies that you've heard from our team today are designed to do exactly that. I will tell you this also. I don't believe there's another executive management team in the banking industry, maybe not in hardly any company, that can compare with this group of folks. If you look at the relatively young age, if you look at the tenure with our company, if you look at the capabilities, well, you saw it today. And I live with it every day. And I'll just tell you, I am super, super proud of our team. Would you help me recognize them for doing a good job?</p><p>And don't forget this, while BB&amp;T is working hard to make the world a better place to live, so can you. We have a why, you have a why. You're not a driftwood. You have a purpose. You can change the world. As I said last night my hope and prayer for all of you -- for all of us, is you get up every morning clear about your purpose. Know why you're here. Focus in on the concept of the power of one. Live today as if it's the only day you have because it is. Don't worry about yesterday, don't wait for tomorrow, live today, make all the contributions you can to this world. And when you focus on individual's freedom with the dignity and respect that they deserve. And when you focus on every single interaction that you have with people, realize that every time you touch someone, you have the opportunity to make their lives better and you never know where their lives will go because you have the power to change the world.</p><p>Thank you all very much.

L'objectif est d'\u00ab\u00e9voluer vers une r\u00e9ponse plus globale pour garantir que le secteur financier reste s\u00fbr, stable et ouvert \u00e0 la concurrence\u00bb.

Pour BBVA, les r\u00e9gulateurs devraient rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre.

Their offering of financial services is still limited in most regions, with the exception of China, but these companies view an incursion into finance as a way to strengthen their already successful digital ecosystems.<br/><br/>DIGITAL BANKING<br/><br/>Ahead of the curve in digital transformation<br/><br/>BBVA announced strong results last week when it published its 2Q 2019 report - much of which was underpinned by continuous strong performance in its digital transformation.<br/><br/>This isn't the first wave of new players heralded in by the fintech phenomenon. So why are authorities like the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and the European Central Bank concerned? The FSB put forward a response in February: the famed Big Tech have a competitive advantage that comes from their wide customer base, the enormous amount of data they can access, and their significant technological and financial capabilities. The FSB points out that this competitive advantage could create far-reaching changes in the structure and saturation of the financial sector, possibly causing serious impacts on the stability of the financial system.<br/><br/>These tech companies can take any number of approaches to involve themselves in the finance sector. First, as suppliers of critical inputs - cloud computing services and data analysis - services that financial institutions will have an incremental need for. Faced with this increasing dependency, authorities point to the fact that these services are concentrated in the hands of just a few suppliers, thus representing a potential source of systemic risk.<br/><br/>Authorities point to the fact that these services are concentrated in the hands of just a few suppliers, thus representing a potential source of systemic risk<br/><br/>In addition, big tech companies could become the face of payment, credit, insurance, and investment services for the customer, either working alone or partnering with third parties to deliver these services to the end customer. Although each participation model creates its own dynamics and risks, the brunt of the debate has focused on big tech activity in the payment space.<br/><br/>Widespread use of their transactional services and store of value - which would be facilitated in many regions with the introduction of open banking - could have an impact on banks' financing models and on loan origination, while at the same time giving rise to the emergence of new infrastructure critically needed for payment system operations.<br/><br/>Given this possibility, the financial authorities should ask themselves if they have sufficient tools to be able to cope with risks such as those described, which currently fall outside the umbrella of the prudential framework. Cooperation between authorities - with different mandates and in different countries - will be key in the face of this inherently global phenomenon.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTF-VT91-F0K1-N1RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 14, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

'Customers must be the real winners,' insisted Torres Vila, stressing the idea that the free flow of data would facilitate the development of new services that will benefit citizens, society and the planet.<br/><br/>Listen to audio Leer en espanol<br/><br/>In his presentation at Money 20/20, Carlos Torres Vila explained how some companies' business models are currently based on accumulating and monopolizing the data they obtain from their customers, which is hindering important advances.<br/><br/>'Data and technology can - and should - be used used to create a more sustainable world, significantly contributing to address two major concerns: the climate crisis and the social challenges related to inequality,' Torres Vila said.<br/><br/>For BBVA, the use of data is an essential accelerator to advance its strategy of helping its customers make the best financial decisions so they can accomplish their goals, in life or in business. But Torres Vila believes that we need to go a step further. 'Imagine that companies - banks or other companies - could have access to the data their customers generate on other platforms. They could use the data to better support their customers in many aspects of their lives, or to promote companies adopting a more sustainable approach,' BBVA's Group executive chairman explained.<br/><br/>But the current situation is not conducive to this data sharing, and the digital giants are accumulating more and more data, thanks to services with a high added value. They are reinforcing their position, creating economies of scale and joining new business areas. 'That's why I think it makes sense that data hoarders are forced to share their data with other companies. The only limit to this should be consent and privacy, and that's because data is an extension of the individual's identity: the places you have been, what you like, what you buy, etc.,' he underscored.<br/><br/>'With data freed to flow, more companies can use it, spurring on innovation and driving competition,' BBVA's Group executive chairman argued. He insists that opening up access to the data big tech companies possess would be a better alternative than splitting up these digital giants to avoid abusive positions in the market, as some are proposing.<br/><br/>'So all in all, customers will, and must be the winners,' emphasized Torres Vila, who is calling for 'global, cross sector regulation' that follows the path set by PSD2 in Europe, which forced banks to share data in real time, provided this is what customers want, through secure, direct and standardized channels.<br/><br/>'While PSD2 created some backlash amongst banks in Europe, I think it is a great idea and should be extended to all data, in all sectors from telecoms to online purchases, and e-commerce to travel, anything,' he said.<br/><br/>Torres Vila ended his presentation by recalling how international coordination to introduce uniform global regulation in the financial sector has already taken place through the Financial Stability Board. 'The G20 should promote the same with regards to the whole digital world, data in particular, to ensure everyone can benefit from the tremendous opportunities the digital revolution can, and will, bring.'<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD9-R771-JD3Y-Y45R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In recent months, Goldman Sachs and Apple teamed up for Apple Card, as one of a number of announced collaborations between finance and tech.</p><p><br/><br/>It would seem that tech and finance are figuring out what BBVA has seen coming for years: By collaborating rather than competing, everybody wins.<br/><br/>'Collaborations with companies like Google represent the future of banking. Consumers end up the true winners when finance and big tech work together for their benefit.'<br/><br/>I said this in the initial press release announcing our collaboration with Google. But I should clarify that by adding that there are multiple winners in a tech and bank link up, from consumers to banks and tech.<br/><br/>Javier Rodriguez Soler, president and CEO at BBVA USA<br/><br/>Consumers are arguably the biggest winners, thanks to an experience that banks and tech would each be hard pressed to provide on their own. The wins for consumers include:<br/><br/>The increased convenience that comes with a single digital platform that allows customers to access their chosen providers with a consistent user experience;<br/><br/>Amazing user experiences that leverage tech companies' years of building solutions geared to them;<br/><br/>Complete digital and physical ecosystems that may include the user experience of tech combined with deep financial insights based on a holistic understanding of customers and their needs, a vast network of ATMs, market leading mobile technology and so much more; and<br/><br/>The creation of an intuitive experience that enables consumers to better manage their money and feel in control of their finances.<br/><br/>For banks, the wins have long-term future- leaning implications considering tech's proven ability to understand and add industries to their portfolios. Some of the wins for banks include:<br/><br/>The ability to achieve scale, faster. These technology companies , with their millions of loyal customers, provide a potential customer base that would take years and millions of dollars for financial institutions to achieve on their own;<br/><br/>The halo effect of a global brand intertwined with the bank's. We know that consumer brand loyalty is strong among technology companies. Banks, which are traditionally more commoditized, benefit by association with them;<br/><br/>It's fair to say that digital experiences are integral to success in the tech industry. They know what their customer wants and needs, and they build it beyond all expectations. As a collaborator, banks have a front row seat to watch, learn and understand how they do it.<br/><br/>Tech companies win by doing what they do best and what has allowed their surge in growth; Focus on improving and enhancing user experiences. Bank partnerships free them from the task of learning a new, highly regulated industry. You can find some of them here, including:<br/><br/>Ability to leverage financial institutions' institutional knowledge. Banking is a highly regulated industry with regulations that are constantly in flux. Banks not only understand regulatory compliance and the legal framework established by various supervisory authorities, but they are specifically staffed to remain in compliance with them;<br/><br/>By working with banks, technology companies do not need to pursue a banking charter to operate, which can be a time-consuming and expensive proposition. Working with a bank allows these companies to focus on their core business, while providing increased convenience to customers and building customer loyalty in the process;<br/><br/>Banking services provided in cooperation with a bank give technology companies the opportunity to diversify and serve a new customer need without the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>So the question remains, if everybody wins, why don't more financial institutions and tech companies work together?<br/><br/>I believe it's a matter of readiness.<br/><br/>For years, BBVA has said that in order for banks to thrive in the digital economy and keep pace with evolving consumer demands, we must transform from a profitable analog bank into a digital knowledge service business that innovates across industries.<br/><br/>At BBVA, this meant pursuing a variety of strategies, including investing early and often in our core platform to become the first bank in the US with a real-time core that allowed us to provide a full suite of banking and payment APIs, either as partnerships or as white labels to third parties and built on the cloud, which enables the bank to be more agile.<br/><br/>This platform was put in place in the US nearly a decade ago at a cost of $ 362 million. At the time, it was the first core platform conversion among similarly sized banks in more than a decade. This type of foresight - out of which grew BBVA Open Platform - is a hallmark of BBVA and the reason we are ready to work with a company like Google.<br/><br/>It's also the reason, despite their many benefits, more bank and tech collaborations haven't yet happened. Most banks are quite simply unprepared for, or unwilling to welcome, a future where tech companies encroach on what for decades has been impenetrable: their business.<br/><br/>For those that are ready though, a collaboration between banks and tech will benefit both, and it's happening now.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P2-KB51-JD3Y-Y1J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In recent months, Goldman Sachs and Apple teamed up for Apple Card, as one of a number of announced collaborations between finance and tech.</p><p><br/><br/>It would seem that tech and finance are figuring out what BBVA has seen coming for years: By collaborating rather than competing, everybody wins.<br/><br/>'Collaborations with companies like Google represent the future of banking. Consumers end up the true winners when finance and big tech work together for their benefit.'<br/><br/>I said this in the initial press release announcing our collaboration with Google. But I should clarify that by adding that there are multiple winners in a tech and bank link up, from consumers to banks and tech.<br/><br/>Javier Rodriguez Soler, president and CEO at BBVA USA<br/><br/>Consumers are arguably the biggest winners, thanks to an experience that banks and tech would each be hard pressed to provide on their own. The wins for consumers include:<br/><br/>The increased convenience that comes with a single digital platform that allows customers to access their chosen providers with a consistent user experience;<br/><br/>Amazing user experiences that leverage tech companies' years of building solutions geared to them;<br/><br/>Complete digital and physical ecosystems that may include the user experience of tech combined with deep financial insights based on a holistic understanding of customers and their needs, a vast network of ATMs, market leading mobile technology and so much more; and<br/><br/>The creation of an intuitive experience that enables consumers to better manage their money and feel in control of their finances.<br/><br/>For banks, the wins have long-term future- leaning implications considering tech's proven ability to understand and add industries to their portfolios. Some of the wins for banks include:<br/><br/>The ability to achieve scale, faster. These technology companies , with their millions of loyal customers, provide a potential customer base that would take years and millions of dollars for financial institutions to achieve on their own;<br/><br/>The halo effect of a global brand intertwined with the bank's. We know that consumer brand loyalty is strong among technology companies. Banks, which are traditionally more commoditized, benefit by association with them;<br/><br/>It's fair to say that digital experiences are integral to success in the tech industry. They know what their customer wants and needs, and they build it beyond all expectations. As a collaborator, banks have a front row seat to watch, learn and understand how they do it.<br/><br/>Tech companies win by doing what they do best and what has allowed their surge in growth; Focus on improving and enhancing user experiences. Bank partnerships free them from the task of learning a new, highly regulated industry. You can find some of them here, including:<br/><br/>Ability to leverage financial institutions' institutional knowledge. Banking is a highly regulated industry with regulations that are constantly in flux. Banks not only understand regulatory compliance and the legal framework established by various supervisory authorities, but they are specifically staffed to remain in compliance with them;<br/><br/>By working with banks, technology companies do not need to pursue a banking charter to operate, which can be a time-consuming and expensive proposition. Working with a bank allows these companies to focus on their core business, while providing increased convenience to customers and building customer loyalty in the process;<br/><br/>Banking services provided in cooperation with a bank give technology companies the opportunity to diversify and serve a new customer need without the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>So the question remains, if everybody wins, why don't more financial institutions and tech companies work together?<br/><br/>I believe it's a matter of readiness.<br/><br/>For years, BBVA has said that in order for banks to thrive in the digital economy and keep pace with evolving consumer demands, we must transform from a profitable analog bank into a digital knowledge service business that innovates across industries.<br/><br/>At BBVA, this meant pursuing a variety of strategies, including investing early and often in our core platform to become the first bank in the US with a real-time core that allowed us to provide a full suite of banking and payment APIs, either as partnerships or as white labels to third parties and built on the cloud, which enables the bank to be more agile.<br/><br/>This platform was put in place in the US nearly a decade ago at a cost of $ 362 million. At the time, it was the first core platform conversion among similarly sized banks in more than a decade. This type of foresight - out of which grew BBVA Open Platform - is a hallmark of BBVA and the reason we are ready to work with a company like Google.<br/><br/>It's also the reason, despite their many benefits, more bank and tech collaborations haven't yet happened. Most banks are quite simply unprepared for, or unwilling to welcome, a future where tech companies encroach on what for decades has been impenetrable: their business.<br/><br/>For those that are ready though, a collaboration between banks and tech will benefit both, and it's happening now.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NV-FH81-JD3Y-Y342-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet they all provide financial services, specifically in the areas of payments and money transfers. Even Facebook is making plans for its own currency, Libra.<br/><br/>Financial regulation needs to respond to the challenges of a changing landscape: fintech startups are paving the way for digital ecosystems while the Big Tech are taking steps to penetrate what has traditionally been banking territory.</p><p><br/><br/>Listen to audio Leer en espanol<br/><br/>What should the regulatory response to the new climate be? It should be aligned to the inherent systemic risks as well as with data protection, trans-border and competitive regulation. This is the conclusion published in a report prepared by BBVA's Digital Regulation group and published by the the University of Deusto's 'Bulletin of Economic Studies.'<br/><br/>A few years ago, regulators were already aware that fintech startups were crashing the financial scene and responded with an approach that 'sought to guarantee adequate control over new risks, while also promoting competition and innovation.' Now they must evolve 'towards a holistic response that guarantees a secure and stable financial sector that continues to be open to competition.' BBVA's Head of Digital Regulation, Pablo Urbiola, who co-authored the report with Lucia Pacheco explains that 'the post-pandemic economy will be more digital than ever, and so the regulatory response will be as important as ever.'<br/><br/>The post-pandemic economy will be more digital than ever, and so the regulatory response will be as important as ever<br/><br/>The authors explain that 'it is likely that the magnitude and nature of the risks will change, as will the nature and degree of competition in the financial sector' with the second wave of competition characterized by the integration of financial services in the Big Tech's digital ecosystems.<br/><br/>Data, the big advantage<br/><br/>As the BBVA report points out, Big Tech companies can reach massive scale very quickly in new lines of business because their digital ecosystems already have millions of active users. Second, they have a powerful capacity to create and control adjacent markets. Third, they have access to large amounts of data and are unmatched in their ability to analyze it.<br/><br/>The BBVA study warns that financial services are not an exception, and these services could put Big Tech in a position to further strengthen their ecosystems, collect additional data, and increase the engagement of their customer base. The report also suggests that the regulatory environment might even act as a catalyst for Big Tech's forays into financial services. Such is the case with open banking frameworks, which allow new competitors to have access to banking's customer data, as well as initiating payments in their name.<br/><br/>A large part of the activities of these companies would be covered by regulations established to address the fintech evolution, such as standards covering payments and e-money. In other areas, however, such as with crypto assets, there are regulatory loopholes. Nevertheless, Urbiola and Pacheco stress that the main risk arises when these activities are conducted on a much larger scale than initially anticipated, not to be underestimated in the case of Big Tech. Financial stability risks could therefore arise if the Big Tech secure a dominant position in segments like payments and loans, transforming themselves into systemic players in the delivery of services that are critical to the economy.<br/><br/>Moreover, regulators have encouraged making the financial sector open to new competitors and lowering the barriers to entry. Regulations about shared access to and use of customer data are particularly relevant to this discussion, the report maintains. In the EU, the PSD2 directive requires banks to standardize open access to their payment data, in real time and without monetary compensation, but there is no equivalent requirement for data from organizations outside the sphere of traditional banking.<br/><br/>This creates a data imbalance: financial companies are obliged to provide easy, standard access to payment data, but the data in other sectors is not available on like-for-like terms. This places the financial sector at a disadvantage when providing digital financial services, and bolsters Big Tech's data advantage. The Financial Stability Board recently stressed this imbalance and the potential implications for financial stability as it supports a greater concentration of financial service suppliers, which could rapidly change the competitive dynamic.<br/><br/>Luckily, the primary regulatory bodies, both globally and in Europe, have put this high on the agenda, as is demonstrated by the European Commission's attention to the topic in their recent consultation document defining their new digital finance strategy<br/><br/>Three ways to regulate Big Tech in digital finance<br/><br/>BBVA foresees three main areas of activity that regulators and supervisors should adopt in order to begin crafting a suitable response to the potential financial stability risks associated with Big Tech's emergence in finance:<br/><br/>1. Revise the specific regulatory frameworks for each activity. First, to ensure that the licensing and supervisory frameworks established for activities such as e-money and non-bank loans are sufficient to contain the risks associated with large-scale supply. Authorities should also put consumer protection, fraud, and cyber attacks on their agenda. The interest of some Big Techs in the area of crypto-assets - potentially launching their own currencies, as is the case with Facebook - should be noted. Some institutions are already working on these issues, both in the EU and farther afield.<br/><br/>2. Promote innovation with a level-playing field. The principle, 'the same activity, with the same risks, should have the same regulation' should be applied. To this end, the approach to regulation needs to shift from being institution-based to activity-based. Similarly, regulation must ensure fair access not only to data, but also to the digital platforms and technical infrastructure needed to deliver financial services.<br/><br/>3. Address the systemic magnitude of Big Tech. Regulatory authorities should weigh whether a response to the financial risks associated with the systemic potential of Big Tech is required. Additionally, authorities should assess if the new Big Tech services, to the degree that they become critical to the global financial system, fall subject to existing standards for the infrastructure deemed critical for financial markets.<br/><br/>As the report lays out, defining a suitable regulatory response to the appearance of Big Tech in the financial sector is one of the greatest public policy challenges facing the authorities. 'Luckily, the primary regulatory bodies, both globally and in Europe, have put this high on the agenda, as is demonstrated by the European Commission's attention to the topic in their recent consultation document defining their new digital finance strategy,' Lucia Pacheco concludes.<br/><br/>How does regtech help banks comply with regulations?<br/><br/>Technological disruption can help banks comply with the ever-expanding body of financial regulatory requirements more efficiently. This was one of the takeaways of the Financial Stability Conference held in Berlin, in which Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo participated. BBVA's Executive Board Director analyzed the regulatory framework that has emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, the need to find the right balance between financial stability and regulatory efficiency and the influence of new technologies in regulatory compliance.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604X-5K31-JD3Y-Y1NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1276\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 16, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet they all provide financial services, specifically in the areas of payments and money transfers. Even Facebook is making plans for its own currency, Libra. Financial regulation needs to respond to the challenges of a changing landscape: fintech startups are paving the way for digital ecosystems while the Big Tech are taking steps to penetrate what has traditionally been banking territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What should the regulatory response to the new climate be? It should be aligned to the inherent systemic risks as well as with data protection, trans-border and competitive regulation. This is the conclusion published in a report prepared by BBVA's Digital Regulation group and published by the the University of Deusto's 'Bulletin of Economic Studies.'</p><p>A few years ago, regulators were already aware that fintech startups were crashing the financial scene and responded with an approach that \"sought to guarantee adequate control over new risks, while also promoting competition and innovation.\" Now they must evolve \"towards a holistic response that guarantees a secure and stable financial sector that continues to be open to competition.\" BBVA's Head of Digital Regulation, Pablo Urbiola, who co-authored the report with Luca Pacheco explains that \"the post-pandemic economy will be more digital than ever, and so the regulatory response will be as important as ever.\"</p><p>The post-pandemic economy will be more digital than ever, and so the regulatory response will be as important as ever</p><p>The authors explain that \"it is likely that the magnitude and nature of the risks will change, as will the nature and degree of competition in the financial sector\" with the second wave of competition characterized by the integration of financial services in the Big Tech's digital ecosystems.</p><p>Data, the big advantage</p><p>As the BBVA report points out, Big Tech companies can reach massive scale very quickly in new lines of business because their digital ecosystems already have millions of active users. Second, they have a powerful capacity to create and control adjacent markets. Third, they have access to large amounts of data and are unmatched in their ability to analyze it.</p><p>The BBVA study warns that financial services are not an exception, and these services could put Big Tech in a position to further strengthen their ecosystems, collect additional data, and increase the engagement of their customer base. The report also suggests that the regulatory environment might even act as a catalyst for Big Tech's forays into financial services. Such is the case with open banking frameworks, which allow new competitors to have access to banking's customer data, as well as initiating payments in their name.</p><p>A large part of the activities of these companies would be covered by regulations established to address the fintech evolution, such as standards covering payments and e-money. In other areas, however, such as with crypto assets, there are regulatory loopholes. Nevertheless, Urbiola and Pacheco stress that the main risk arises when these activities are conducted on a much larger scale than initially anticipated, not to be underestimated in the case of Big Tech. Financial stability risks could therefore arise if the Big Tech secure a dominant position in segments like payments and loans, transforming themselves into systemic players in the delivery of services that are critical to the economy.</p><p>Moreover, regulators have encouraged making the financial sector open to new competitors and lowering the barriers to entry. Regulations about shared access to and use of customer data are particularly relevant to this discussion, the report maintains. In the EU, the PSD2 directive requires banks to standardize open access to their payment data, in real time and without monetary compensation, but there is no equivalent requirement for data from organizations outside the sphere of traditional banking.</p><p>This creates a data imbalance: financial companies are obliged to provide easy, standard access to payment data, but the data in other sectors is not available on like-for-like terms. This places the financial sector at a disadvantage when providing digital financial services, and bolsters Big Tech's data advantage. The Financial Stability Board recently stressed this imbalance and the potential implications for financial stability as it supports a greater concentration of financial service suppliers, which could rapidly change the competitive dynamic.</p><p>Luckily, the primary regulatory bodies, both globally and in Europe, have put this high on the agenda, as is demonstrated by the European Commission's attention to the topic in their recent consultation document defining their new digital finance strategy</p><p>Three ways to regulate Big Tech in digital finance</p><p>BBVA foresees three main areas of activity that regulators and supervisors should adopt in order to begin crafting a suitable response to the potential financial stability risks associated with Big Tech's emergence in finance:</p><p>1. Revise the specific regulatory frameworks for each activity. First, to ensure that the licensing and supervisory frameworks established for activities such as e-money and non-bank loans are sufficient to contain the risks associated with large-scale supply. Authorities should also put consumer protection, fraud, and cyber attacks on their agenda. The interest of some Big Techs in the area of crypto-assets - potentially launching their own currencies, as is the case with Facebook - should be noted. Some institutions are already working on these issues, both in the EU and farther afield.</p><p>2. Promote innovation with a level-playing field. The principle, \"the same activity, with the same risks, should have the same regulation\" should be applied. To this end, the approach to regulation needs to shift from being institution-based to activity-based. Similarly, regulation must ensure fair access not only to data, but also to the digital platforms and technical infrastructure needed to deliver financial services.</p><p>3. Address the systemic magnitude of Big Tech. Regulatory authorities should weigh whether a response to the financial risks associated with the systemic potential of Big Tech is required. Additionally, authorities should assess if the new Big Tech services, to the degree that they become critical to the global financial system, fall subject to existing standards for the infrastructure deemed critical for financial markets.</p><p>As the report lays out, defining a suitable regulatory response to the appearance of Big Tech in the financial sector is one of the greatest public policy challenges facing the authorities. \"Luckily, the primary regulatory bodies, both globally and in Europe, have put this high on the agenda, as is demonstrated by the European Commission's attention to the topic in their recent consultation document defining their new digital finance strategy,\" Luca Pacheco concludes.</p><p>Source: BBVA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBNWS-0053696994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INBNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607P-8BP1-JB5M-W37C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Banking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002755</classCode><className>BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Those ecosystems will leverage the trust that consumers have placed in traditional financial industry players and tech companies of all sizes \u2013 including Big Tech , of course.   Where once the marquee names in tech (and no shortage of FinTechs) jockeyed for primary banking services relationships, an increasing number of partnerships are now taking shape.   These collaborations leverage the ease of use demanded (and, in large part, perfected by) app- and platform-driven firms and banks that have the necessary scale and breadth as consumers navigate a rocky economic landscape.   The writing has been on the wall: PYMNTS research has found that though most people are satisfied with their in-place relationships with banks, only about 40 percent of people would be \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to bring their banking relationships to Big Tech or FinTechs.   To that end, BBVA was one of six banks that said on Monday (Aug. 3) that it would work with Google to deliver \u201csmart\u201d digital bank accounts, using Google Pay as an app-driven way to broaden its digital reach and improve users\u2019 experiences with their financial institutions (FIs).   In an announcement, the bank said it would work with Google to debut a co-branded, FDIC-insured, digital-only bank account next year.   In terms of mechanics, the accounts would be offered through Google Pay on the front end, consumer-facing side of the equation, while using BBVA\u2019s existing infrastructure to deliver financial services and products to consumers.   The latest roster of names signing on to offer checking and savings accounts through Google Pay joins Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union, who back in January  confirmed reports that they would enter co-branded relationships with Google in 2021.   And as Shayan Khwaja , BBVA executive vice president and director of consumer lending, told Karen Webster in an interview, the latest announcement dovetails with BBVA\u2019s five-year growth plan , springboarding off its previously announced open banking initiative known as BBVA Open Platform .   As he noted, the coronavirus has accelerated the pace of banks\u2019 digital transformation to warp speed. But by and large, Khwaja said, challenges remain in place for those firms that want to reinvent the banking experience and overcome consumers\u2019 inertia (and binary choices of choosing Big Tech over banking or vice versa), while delivering the best attributes of traditional banking and tech-savvy upstarts to end users.   Bringing the best of both worlds together will enable BBVA\u2019s (and other banks\u2019) primary checking account holders to get real-time money management tips and stay on top of bill payments \u2014 all while linking payment and identity credentials to those checking accounts. In this way, Google gets new users for its Pay offering , and the banks get new customers and strengthen their respective brands.   Ready For The Digital Shift   The pandemic, of course, has given a tailwind to a digital shift that has been pervasive across commerce, to be sure, but also banking, as individuals embrace new habits out of necessity. In discussing how the pandemic has pushed banking\u2019s own digital shift and the way clients\u2019 needs are changing, Khwaja noted that, as announced  earlier in the year, through the second round of funding of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), BBVA funded approximately $3.3 billion dollars in small business loans.  Consumers, he said, have also been paying down debt and saving money, evidence that they\u2019re paying attention to their own financial status.   As Khwaja pointed out, it\u2019s no easy task to create a digital financial services ecosystem. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have the [technical] ability, but then your clientele needs to adopt,\u201d he told Webster. \u201cYou may get the early adopters, but there\u2019s a massive population that you have to convince. It all needs to be user-friendly.\u201d   According to Khwaja, the digital shift is here to stay.   Khwaja noted that his own firm has been pushing ever farther into the digital space during the past decade \u2014 with digitally-delivered consumer lending and digital account openings \u2014 pointing to a five-year plan that, in part, seeks to grow the bank through collaborations focused on data and technology.   As Webster noted, the collaborations like the ones struck between banks and Google are aimed at delivering banking as a  service , while offering a contextualized experience that gives consumers real-time insights into how (and where) they are spending, transacting and shopping. And, as Khwaja said, consumers have increasingly come to expect an Amazon-like experience (in terms of ease of use) as any number of banking activities have made their way online \u2014 while those consumers trust banks chiefly because the industry is regulated and has safeguards in place.   BBVA , of course, is only one bank among several collaborating with Google to offer digital accounts \u2014 and thus is competing for consumers\u2019 mind share and share of wallet. Against that backdrop, maintained Khwaja, BBVA\u2019s omnichannel approach, which will bring the existing branch network into play, offers a competitive advantage.   As PYMNTS\u2019 own research has shown, brick-and-mortar banking is alive and well.  In fact, in the report titled \u201c What is a Bank? \u201d, surveyed consumers said the third-most important banking service is maintaining a physical branch that can be visited as needed.   \u201cIt\u2019s very much an ecosystem,\u201d Khwaja said of the Google partnership, and added that \u201cwe\u2019re bringing the full power of the bank to customers \u2026 with a nationwide product that\u2019s very digital.\u201d   Looking Ahead   With a nod to the fact that the Google/BBVA initiative is thus far focused on digital checking accounts , down the road we may see the rise of the \u201c super app \u201d as financial ecosystems take shape and Big Tech and banks join forces.   Webster  noted  back in November (when the Google and Citi \u201csmart DDA\u201d account was announced) that linking payments, banking, commerce and identity can help financial services fully enter the digital age, becoming a seamless resource that consumers use to plan their daily lives. Digital, in other words, renders money into an abstract concept that is part of better consumer decision-making across channels.   Consumers remain receptive to such everyday apps. In July of last year, PYMNTS research revealed that more than half of U.S. consumers would be interested in an app that offered a broad range of everyday features and functions geared toward money management. Google ranked high among consumers\u2019 choice as a trusted provider of that app \u2014 at No. 4, behind PayPal, Amazon and Walmart.   As Khwaja told Webster, \u201cWe were talking about digital well before a lot of the naysayers were saying, \u2018banking is banking. How are you going to digitize that?\u2019 We\u2019ve been believers in digital for a very long time \u2013 and it prepares us to be ready to work with a player like Google in this space.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs. While that\u2019s a great opportunity for providers, it also presents a challenge \u2014 27.4 million consumers are looking to cancel their subscriptions because of friction and cost concerns.

Si bien BBVA Research considera ms probable que las grandes empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas, conocidas como 'bigtech[3]', intervengan activamente en la distribuci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de productos financieros[4] que en su provisi\u00f3n final, al menos en las reas ms reguladas como la captaci\u00f3n de dep\u00f3sitos, el alcance final de su expansi\u00f3n en el sector financiero es incierto y est condicionado por el marco regulatorio y de competencia. </p><p>De esta manera, ha indicado que algunos riesgos podran concentrarse en un n\u00famero muy reducido de jugadores y que la separaci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n y la distribuci\u00f3n de servicios financieros podra desalinear algunos incentivos y generar problemas de riesgo moral en la concesi\u00f3n de crdito, as como diluir algunas responsabilidades de protecci\u00f3n al consumidor. Por ello, BBVA Research[5] ha destacado que los reguladores y supervisores financieros 'deben seguir de cerca la evoluci\u00f3n del mercado, identificar los riesgos emergentes y, cuando sea necesario, ajustar el marco regulatorio, de forma que garantice la estabilidad financiera y la protecci\u00f3n del consumidor y al mismo tiempo promueva la competencia en igualdad de condiciones'. En este sentido, un entorno en el que coexisten distintos tipos de proveedores y modelos de negocio requiere avanzar hacia un marco regulatorio y de supervisi\u00f3n ms basado en actividades y riesgos que en el tipo de entidad que las desarrolla. En cuanto a la competencia, el informe ha resaltado que operar en igualdad de condiciones requiere tambin regulaciones sobre la portabilidad y el acceso a datos que sean recprocas y no generen asimetras entre distintos tipos de jugadores o, de lo contrario, podran contribuirse a la tendencia de los mercados digitales hacia la concentraci\u00f3n en unas pocas grandes empresas que acumulan grandes cantidades de datos y extienden su poder de un mercado a otro. En esta lnea, ha reiterado que el papel de las autoridades de protecci\u00f3n de datos y de las autoridades de competencia es 'vital' para evitar que menoscaben los derechos de los usuarios como titulares de datos y que abusen de su posici\u00f3n de dominio para restringir la competencia. Por \u00faltimo, BBVA Research ha analizado el problema al que se enfrentan las autoridades de hacer frente con polticas nacionales a compa\u00f1as y ecosistemas digitales que son globales, lo que supone una dificultad.

Puente also emphasized that BBVA's commitment to entrepreneurs is one of the key elements of the bank's strategy to advance its digital transformation.<br/><br/>Torres Vila also explained how innovation makes the world a more sustainable place, adding: 'We can really progress as a society to solve problems - old and new - including ones associated with making the world a better and more sustainable place. I think innovation - and the innovators here today - can have a real impact on solving that problem.'<br/><br/>Torres Vila began the data discussion by noting that the use of this resource in business was not new, for example financial services companies had used data to make decisions on things like underwriting for decades. He also explained the positive impact data usage had on BBVA itself, outlining how BBVA's use of data in things like its mobile banking app - which he noted had just been named the world's best for the third straight year - had dramatically increased the banks Net Promoter Score. This, he said, was linked to how you use data to deliver more personalised services that help customers make better decisions in support of their goals. He also highlighted how the bank was going to cross the tipping point of digital sales sometime during 2020, noting how digital sales were now at 44 percent while they were at 10 percent three years ago.<br/><br/>He added: 'Clearly, data is exploding. And we're in the data revolution. It's affecting every business all the time, every business, more and more as we go forward. But there is quite a mess in terms of what the rules are for using data in business - and because that is so critical for every business, I think we need to get our act together at a global level and really develop a consistent set of rules worldwide.'<br/><br/>He stressed that the advance of digitization had brought with it a huge increase in the frequency and scope of data being created. But with that had come the emergence of dominant digital ecosystems that benefit from strong network effects and a subsequent gatekeeper role.<br/><br/>BBVA Chairman Carlos Torres Vila during his intervention at South Summit.<br/><br/>He said: 'Right now, it's not being shared correctly. It's not even explained correctly and the way rules are set now it will lead to huge network effects, gatekeeper roles by companies that will continue to concentrate power instead of introducing competition.'<br/><br/>He added: 'So regulation is very necessary to ensure that there is a level playing field, and that we mitigate the potential negative effects of concentration because of this positive network effect. Now, right now, we have quite a dispersed set of rules. More than 100 countries have passed data regulation rules, but they're different, even within the same country, they are different'.<br/><br/>'And that creates a lack of customer protection and a non-level playing field. There is an asymmetric reaping of the benefits of data between the customer and the service providers and we need to change that.'<br/><br/>'The bank is going to cross the tipping point of digital sales sometime during 2020'<br/><br/>Asked by Spain Startup CEO Maria Benjumea what was now needed to manage this change to ensure everyone could take advantage of the data resource, Torres Vila said that unlike, say oil, the same data sets can be used over and over again in different ways to generate different sets of value, insight or ultimately products and services.<br/><br/>This mattered even more in an era when industry lines and geographic lines were blurring, and where customers, who are actually the creators of the data in many cases, expected to be able to contract services from wherever suits them best. More than that, businesses needed to recognise that it was the customer's data - not theirs simply because they collected it - and that as the customer's data, with the right consents in place, it should be allowed to flow freely across sectors.<br/><br/>Asked by Benujmea how in practice that could work, Torres Vila said there was already a partial framework in place that could support this. He said: 'In some sectors, like banking in Europe, we have pieces of that regulation, for example we have the payment services directive that mandates that customers transaction data for the last two years, is accessible through API's in a standardised format, real time by registered payment providers. It's a great idea. 'This should be extended not only to transaction data, but to all data. And it should be extended not only in banking but to all sectors, telecoms data, purchases, online, ecommerce, travel, anything.<br/><br/>Maria Benjumea then challenged him on how he thought regulation could work in practice, especially given, as he had noted, the diminishing importance of geographic barriers. The BBVA Chairman conceded it was tricky, and that divergent geopolitical interests made it tougher, but he also stated he was positive things could be done.<br/><br/>He said: 'I'm quite optimistic that data regulation could follow the same path that trade did 30-something years ago, so we're doing our best for sure to try to influence policymakers in Europe and around the world to push on this direction.'<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X70-S5J1-F0K1-N4MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Jahja Setiaatmadja, the bank\u2019s longtime president director, tells us that BCA has committed to growing its digital potentials to adopt to customer behaviour and position itself as a leader in digital based financial services.    Setiaatmadja is currently leading the bank in digitising its processes by focusing on enhancing their digital platforms such as internet and mobile banking to meet ever-changing customer needs and to stay abreast of the competition.    His initiatives resulted in a 72% increase on the number of accounts opened online getting 6,950 transactions a day in the second quarter 2020 from 4,041 transactions a day in the first quarter of the year. The number of current and savings account (CASA) opened also grew steadily to 13% year on year (YoY) and 8.3% year to date (YtD) to $39.75 billion (IDR 586 trillion) in the first half of 2020. Account balance also rose to 18% from the pre-pandemic times.    Setiaatmadja credits the significant increase in the bank\u2019s digital banking transactions to key digital investments and its ability to turn market disruptions into opportunities.    BCA, Indonesia\u2019s largest private bank, is also Southeast Asia\u2019s largest lender by value with a market capital of about $24.5 billion.    The following is the edited transcript of the interview:    Foo Boon Ping (FBP) : Digital banking is transforming the financial services landscape in Asia with neobanks and big tech challenging the traditional banks. In your opinion, where do you think the future is headed for banks like yourself? What is the one key opportunity and challenge that your bank faces in this age of digital innovation and disruption?    Jahja Setiaatmadja (JS) : With a strong footing as transaction banking player in Indonesia, Bank Central Asia (BCA) has been expanding its digital capabilities to respond to the changing customer behaviour and heading toward digital based financial service provider. In the past few months during the pandemic, we have seen the promising results of our digital investments. The number of customers and accounts has increased steadily, and so has current and savings account (CASA). By growing CASA which entails lower cost of funds, we have the luxury to opt for good quality assets.    Time is of the essence when tapping market opportunities. We have to be agile, to learn from the market swiftly, and see what we can add more value to customers, hence turning \u2018disruption\u2019 or \u2018challenge\u2019 into \u2018opportunity\u2019. The pandemic itself could be seen as an opportunity to read market behavior in transacting as BCA is now connected to wider ecosystem compared to pre-pandemic period. BCA is a key partner for payment and settlement transactions for e-commerce and fintech players. Going forward, we expect cashless and cardless transactions to be a significant part of the \u2018new normal\u2019. Furthermore, Indonesia\u2019s young demographic also gives the benefit of embracing digital era in a faster way and be of help in educating the more senior generation when using digital channel. Once conveniently used, the chance of more people embracing digitalisation is wide open, and we see this as an opportunity to tap.    Support from the government and regulators have been tremendous during this difficult time. The banking industry is witnessing how the global health crisis has spurred customers to embrace digital services, forcing banks like BCA to catch up digitalisation at an unprecedented pace. With the rising number of online transactions, BCA has to continuously complement digital functionality with IT security systems to mitigate the potential cybercrime attacks. Investments in digital is also expensive and have to be continuous.    Expanding digital capabilities is key to growing customer base and ecosystem    FBP : What is your key strategy to succeed and the key priority pillars that support the strategy? What is your vision for your bank in toward its journey of \"reinvention\"?    JS : BCA\u2019s journey as transactional bank began with building critical mass for its payment systems and offering customer convenience as the added value. BCA has to be within the top three payment options for both individual and business purposes. We believe that generally every individual would need only two payment banks for transactions, while a company would be convenient by having maximum three to four main payment accounts. Fast forward, customer loyalty has proven that our strategy works and our achievements today suggested that continuous expansion in digital capabilities is vital especially in growing low cost funds of CASA, and particularly is aligned with the changing customer behaviour towards digital. This holds true especially during the pandemic when mobility is restricted and people become more dependent on their mobile devices.    BCA\u2019s competitive edge is in growing customer base and enriching customer experience through expanded ecosystem.    BCA mobile banking and internet banking have been our key channels to remain ahead of our peers. We are among the country\u2019s pioneers to launch internet banking in early 2000s and mobile banking in 2006. We have introduced application programming interface (API) back in 2017, connecting to major fintech and e-commerce players. Our online account opening facility which was launched in April 2019 has garnered 38% contribution of growth in the number of accounts opened during the first half of 2020.    Going forward we see that digitalisation has greater opportunity to be permanent in some areas of \u2018new normal.\u2019 Continued feature enhancements in our digital platforms such as internet banking and mobile banking are required to meet ever-changing customer needs that shift toward cashless, cardless and contactless culture.    Acceleration of digital strategy, such as moving toward open banking platform is pivotal to grow our customer base including merchants and to create banking experience. Relentless efforts are in place to ensure convenient and secured transactions supported by system stability.    FBP : What are your views about a cloud and open architecture based platform as a service (PaaS) core banking infrastructure platform that support APIs and microservices?    JS : We embrace open platform/open architecture and cloud-based infrastructure. Cloud services offer cost and space efficiency in addition to more data capacity. However, the implementation shall be within the regulator\u2019s guidelines.    Digitalisation boosted customer online transactions    FBP : What are the key digital initiatives that you have launched and talk through the background/context to why you started them and what you have achieved? What role is technology playing in the reinvention of the bank? Can you give us some examples of technologies in use and how they're supporting this?    JS : Online account opening through mobile banking was introduced in April 2019 and the results have been encouraging. During the pandemic, the peak number of account opened online surged by 72% on quarter to 6,950/day in second quarter 2020 (Q2 2020) from 4,041/day in the first quarter of the year. Account balance also increased by 18% from pre-COVID period. New online account opening contribution to total new account was 38% year on year (YoY) June 2020.    BCA now processed $2115.25 (IDR 31 million) transaction/day rose 26% YoY in first half 2020 (H1 2020). Robust mobile banking use in the first semester also booked 73% YoY increase. Combined mobile and internet banking transaction numbers grew ~51% YoY. Mobile and internet banking transaction value contributed 47% of total transactions, outperformed branch banking of 45% contribution. Mobile banking number of transactions increase was boosted by transfer transaction (up 88% YoY) and virtual account (rose 51%).    FBP : How have they impacted your customers, your internal organisation and financial performance?    JS : CASA growth which can be a reflection of customer trust in using our digital platform also recorded an increase of 13% YoY and 8.3% year to date (YtD) to $39.75 billion (IDR 586 trillion) in the first half of 2020, supported by savings account.    We achieved BSQ (Bank Service Quality) index score of 4.86 from scale 1 to 5. HALO BCA call centre has resolved 99.84% of filed complaints last year, and continues to play an important role in our digital campaigns.    FBP : With reinvention comes risks and failures, could you talk about the risks and failures that you have experienced in your career and how they have changed you and the institution(s) that you lead? What\u2019s one professional risk you\u2019re proud of taking? How are you teaching people at your bank about risks and failures?    JS : We believe that there is no success stories without invention or re-invention. We launch a new product only after we study market or customer behaviour. As a transactional bank, BCA has the luxury of being able to observe customer operating accounts and develop potential products in the market and finally let the market decide.    Everything comes with risks, but we can say that it is always a learning process and therefore has lessons learned to keep moving on and growing endlessly.    Conservative measures and sustaining liquidity as safeguard    FBP : What are your personal aspirations for the new year? What personal advice do you have for people wanting to follow your footsteps?    JS : The impact of economic headwinds caused by the pandemic which is translated into pressured asset quality and profitability is likely to linger until next year. Particularly for Indonesia banking sector, the true asset quality condition will emerge once the loan moratorium period ends in March 2021, if not extended.    Given such uncertainties, adopting conservative measures will be in our agenda while at the same time sustaining ample liquidity as the buffer for any unforeseen events.    FBP : What is your personal assessment of how this crisis will play out and the outlook for the industry?    JS : This crisis is different from the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The 1997 crisis was a combination of political turmoil with public distrust in the banking system, while the 2008 crisis only lasted for a short cycle. Today Indonesia banking systems are more prudent and we have seen government initiatives to protect the economy.    Observing the recent digital trends especially during the current pandemic, banking industry will change towards open banking, that is, more collaboration with non-banks financial service providers such as e-commerce and fintech players. IT role will be more important especially in the area of data analytics and cyber security.    Margin will be in downward trend affected by lower interest rate environment and loan restructuring which postpone interest income recognition.    Asset quality to worsen as economic growth trending down and recovery trajectory is still very fluid. Periodic review are required to obtain a better view of debtor recovery capabilities especially after the relaxation period ends.    Having ample liquidity is a must to anticipate uncertain conditions. Forced merger/consolidation might be on the table for banks with limited buffer on liquidity, asset quality and capital.    The good news is that the government and regulators have been very supportive to the industry. A series of stimulus were launched to address the challenges in the economy, health and financial sector which include loan restructuring relaxation.    FBP : How exactly is the banking industry in the region being affected in your view?    JS : Banking sector is a proxy of economy, any economy downturn will cause banks to slow down while credit risk is increasing.    FBP : Would you say that your bank is \u201cready\u201d for this crisis, and if so how?    No one is prepared for this COVID-19 crisis. What we are focusing on now is to prioritise the safety of our staff and optimise convenient services within our large ecosystem. During the pandemic, we introduced among others #Bankingfromhome campaign, Payment Link, QRIS feature enhancements for ease of transactions. On the lending front, we pay more attention on credit restructuring and monitoring to see debtor recovery capabilities. As always, BCA will stand by our customers to go through this challenging time and uphold customer satisfaction and loyalty in the long run.    FBP : What were some of your bank\u2019s first line responses to the crisis (both for customers as well as to staff)?    JS : BCA ensures the adherence to health protocols as the safety of our customers and staff comes first. Various measures are taken such as working from home, virtual meetings, provision of health necessities (sanitisers, surgical masks, body temperature checks, etc,).    For the community, through BaktiBCA programs, we provide assistance in the form of masks, APD (personal protective equipment), ventilators and foods.    FBP : How do you think this crisis will change your bank and the industry in the long term?    JS : It is too early to talk about the long term because we do not know how long the crisis will last.

Jahja Setiaatmadja, the bank\u2019s longtime president director, tells us that BCA has committed to growing its digital potentials to adopt to customer behaviour and position itself as a leader in digital based financial services.    Setiaatmadja is currently leading the bank in digitising its processes by focusing on enhancing their digital platforms such as internet and mobile banking to meet ever-changing customer needs and to stay abreast of the competition.    His initiatives resulted in a 72% increase on the number of accounts opened online getting 6,950 transactions a day in the second quarter 2020 from 4,041 transactions a day in the first quarter of the year. The number of current and savings account (CASA) opened also grew steadily to 13% year on year (YoY) and 8.3% year to date (YtD) to $39.75 billion (IDR 586 trillion) in the first half of 2020. Account balance also rose to 18% from the pre-pandemic times.    Setiaatmadja credits the significant increase in the bank\u2019s digital banking transactions to key digital investments and its ability to turn market disruptions into opportunities.    BCA, Indonesia\u2019s largest private bank, is also Southeast Asia\u2019s largest lender by value with a market capital of about $24.5 billion.    The following is the edited transcript of the interview:    Foo Boon Ping (FBP) : Digital banking is transforming the financial services landscape in Asia with neobanks and big tech challenging the traditional banks. In your opinion, where do you think the future is headed for banks like yourself? What is the one key opportunity and challenge that your bank faces in this age of digital innovation and disruption?    Jahja Setiaatmadja (JS) : With a strong footing as transaction banking player in Indonesia, Bank Central Asia (BCA) has been expanding its digital capabilities to respond to the changing customer behaviour and heading toward digital based financial service provider. In the past few months during the pandemic, we have seen the promising results of our digital investments. The number of customers and accounts has increased steadily, and so has current and savings account (CASA). By growing CASA which entails lower cost of funds, we have the luxury to opt for good quality assets.    Time is of the essence when tapping market opportunities. We have to be agile, to learn from the market swiftly, and see what we can add more value to customers, hence turning \u2018disruption\u2019 or \u2018challenge\u2019 into \u2018opportunity\u2019. The pandemic itself could be seen as an opportunity to read market behavior in transacting as BCA is now connected to wider ecosystem compared to pre-pandemic period. BCA is a key partner for payment and settlement transactions for e-commerce and fintech players. Going forward, we expect cashless and cardless transactions to be a significant part of the \u2018new normal\u2019. Furthermore, Indonesia\u2019s young demographic also gives the benefit of embracing digital era in a faster way and be of help in educating the more senior generation when using digital channel. Once conveniently used, the chance of more people embracing digitalisation is wide open, and we see this as an opportunity to tap.    Support from the government and regulators have been tremendous during this difficult time. The banking industry is witnessing how the global health crisis has spurred customers to embrace digital services, forcing banks like BCA to catch up digitalisation at an unprecedented pace. With the rising number of online transactions, BCA has to continuously complement digital functionality with IT security systems to mitigate the potential cybercrime attacks. Investments in digital is also expensive and have to be continuous.    Expanding digital capabilities is key to growing customer base and ecosystem    FBP : What is your key strategy to succeed and the key priority pillars that support the strategy? What is your vision for your bank in toward its journey of \"reinvention\"?    JS : BCA\u2019s journey as transactional bank began with building critical mass for its payment systems and offering customer convenience as the added value. BCA has to be within the top three payment options for both individual and business purposes. We believe that generally every individual would need only two payment banks for transactions, while a company would be convenient by having maximum three to four main payment accounts. Fast forward, customer loyalty has proven that our strategy works and our achievements today suggested that continuous expansion in digital capabilities is vital especially in growing low cost funds of CASA, and particularly is aligned with the changing customer behaviour towards digital. This holds true especially during the pandemic when mobility is restricted and people become more dependent on their mobile devices.    BCA\u2019s competitive edge is in growing customer base and enriching customer experience through expanded ecosystem.    BCA mobile banking and internet banking have been our key channels to remain ahead of our peers. We are among the country\u2019s pioneers to launch internet banking in early 2000s and mobile banking in 2006. We have introduced application programming interface (API) back in 2017, connecting to major fintech and e-commerce players. Our online account opening facility which was launched in April 2019 has garnered 38% contribution of growth in the number of accounts opened during the first half of 2020.    Going forward we see that digitalisation has greater opportunity to be permanent in some areas of \u2018new normal.\u2019 Continued feature enhancements in our digital platforms such as internet banking and mobile banking are required to meet ever-changing customer needs that shift toward cashless, cardless and contactless culture.    Acceleration of digital strategy, such as moving toward open banking platform is pivotal to grow our customer base including merchants and to create banking experience. Relentless efforts are in place to ensure convenient and secured transactions supported by system stability.    FBP : What are your views about a cloud and open architecture based platform as a service (PaaS) core banking infrastructure platform that support APIs and microservices?    JS : We embrace open platform/open architecture and cloud-based infrastructure. Cloud services offer cost and space efficiency in addition to more data capacity. However, the implementation shall be within the regulator\u2019s guidelines.    Digitalisation boosted customer online transactions    FBP : What are the key digital initiatives that you have launched and talk through the background/context to why you started them and what you have achieved? What role is technology playing in the reinvention of the bank? Can you give us some examples of technologies in use and how they're supporting this?    JS : Online account opening through mobile banking was introduced in April 2019 and the results have been encouraging. During the pandemic, the peak number of account opened online surged by 72% on quarter to 6,950/day in second quarter 2020 (Q2 2020) from 4,041/day in the first quarter of the year. Account balance also increased by 18% from pre-COVID period. New online account opening contribution to total new account was 38% year on year (YoY) June 2020.    BCA now processed 31 million transaction/day rose 26% YoY in first half 2020 (H1 2020). Robust mobile banking use in the first semester also booked 73% YoY increase. Combined mobile and internet banking transaction numbers grew ~51% YoY. Mobile and internet banking transaction value contributed 47% of total transactions, outperformed branch banking of 45% contribution. Mobile banking number of transactions increase was boosted by transfer transaction (up 88% YoY) and virtual account (rose 51%).    FBP : How have they impacted your customers, your internal organisation and financial performance?    JS : CASA growth which can be a reflection of customer trust in using our digital platform also recorded an increase of 13% YoY and 8.3% year to date (YtD) to $39.75 billion (IDR 586 trillion) in the first half of 2020, supported by savings account.    We achieved BSQ (Bank Service Quality) index score of 4.86 from scale 1 to 5. HALO BCA call centre has resolved 99.84% of filed complaints last year, and continues to play an important role in our digital campaigns.    FBP : With reinvention comes risks and failures, could you talk about the risks and failures that you have experienced in your career and how they have changed you and the institution(s) that you lead? What\u2019s one professional risk you\u2019re proud of taking? How are you teaching people at your bank about risks and failures?    JS : We believe that there is no success stories without invention or re-invention. We launch a new product only after we study market or customer behaviour. As a transactional bank, BCA has the luxury of being able to observe customer operating accounts and develop potential products in the market and finally let the market decide.    Everything comes with risks, but we can say that it is always a learning process and therefore has lessons learned to keep moving on and growing endlessly.    Conservative measures and sustaining liquidity as safeguard    FBP : What are your personal aspirations for the new year? What personal advice do you have for people wanting to follow your footsteps?    JS : The impact of economic headwinds caused by the pandemic which is translated into pressured asset quality and profitability is likely to linger until next year. Particularly for Indonesia banking sector, the true asset quality condition will emerge once the loan moratorium period ends in March 2021, if not extended.    Given such uncertainties, adopting conservative measures will be in our agenda while at the same time sustaining ample liquidity as the buffer for any unforeseen events.    FBP : What is your personal assessment of how this crisis will play out and the outlook for the industry?    JS : This crisis is different from the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The 1997 crisis was a combination of political turmoil with public distrust in the banking system, while the 2008 crisis only lasted for a short cycle. Today Indonesia banking systems are more prudent and we have seen government initiatives to protect the economy.    Observing the recent digital trends especially during the current pandemic, banking industry will change towards open banking, that is, more collaboration with non-banks financial service providers such as e-commerce and fintech players. IT role will be more important especially in the area of data analytics and cyber security.    Margin will be in downward trend affected by lower interest rate environment and loan restructuring which postpone interest income recognition.    Asset quality to worsen as economic growth trending down and recovery trajectory is still very fluid. Periodic review are required to obtain a better view of debtor recovery capabilities especially after the relaxation period ends.    Having ample liquidity is a must to anticipate uncertain conditions. Forced merger/consolidation might be on the table for banks with limited buffer on liquidity, asset quality and capital.    The good news is that the government and regulators have been very supportive to the industry. A series of stimulus were launched to address the challenges in the economy, health and financial sector which include loan restructuring relaxation.    FBP : How exactly is the banking industry in the region being affected in your view?    JS : Banking sector is a proxy of economy, any economy downturn will cause banks to slow down while credit risk is increasing.    FBP : Would you say that your bank is \u201cready\u201d for this crisis, and if so how?    No one is prepared for this COVID-19 crisis. What we are focusing on now is to prioritise the safety of our staff and optimise convenient services within our large ecosystem. During the pandemic, we introduced among others #Bankingfromhome campaign, Payment Link, QRIS feature enhancements for ease of transactions. On the lending front, we pay more attention on credit restructuring and monitoring to see debtor recovery capabilities. As always, BCA will stand by our customers to go through this challenging time and uphold customer satisfaction and loyalty in the long run.    FBP : What were some of your bank\u2019s first line responses to the crisis (both for customers as well as to staff)?    JS : BCA ensures the adherence to health protocols as the safety of our customers and staff comes first. Various measures are taken such as working from home, virtual meetings, provision of health necessities (sanitisers, surgical masks, body temperature checks, etc,).    For the community, through BaktiBCA programs, we provide assistance in the form of masks, APD (personal protective equipment), ventilators and foods.    FBP : How do you think this crisis will change your bank and the industry in the long term?    JS : It is too early to talk about the long term because we do not know how long the crisis will last.    FBP : Thank you for doing this interview with us.

''The Antitrust Impulse.'' ''Antitrust in an Expanding Economy.'' Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. ''This is my command post,'' said Lina Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It's nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.</p><p>  The retailer overwhelmingly dominates online commerce, employs more than half a million people and powers much of the internet itself through its cloud computing division. On Tuesday, it briefly became the second company to be worth a trillion dollars.</p><p>  If competitors tremble at Amazon's ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon's customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it.</p><p>  But then, until recently, no one worried about Facebook, Google or Twitter either. Now politicians, the media, academics and regulators are kicking around ideas that would, metaphorically or literally, cut them down to size. Members of Congress grilled social media executives on Wednesday in yet another round of hearings on Capitol Hill. Not since the Department of Justice took on Microsoft in the mid-1990s has Big Tech been scrutinized like this.</p><p>Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination. That is beginning to change, and one significant reason is Ms. Khan.</p><p>  In early 2017, when she was an unknown law student, Ms. Khan published ''Amazon's Antitrust Paradox'' in the Yale Law Journal. Her argument went against a consensus in antitrust circles that dates back to the 1970s -- the moment when regulation was redefined to focus on consumer welfare, which is to say price. Since Amazon is renowned for its cut-rate deals, it would seem safe from federal intervention.</p><p>  Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy.</p><p>Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: ''The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon's rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.''</p><p>  The paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.</p><p>  She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan's proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label ''Hipster Antitrust.'' Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes.</p><p>  Ms. Khan was born in London to Pakistani parents who emigrated to the United States when she was 11. She is now 29, an Amazon critic whose Amazon account is largely inactive, newly married to a Texas doctor who uses his Amazon Prime account all the time. Ms. Khan was supposed to move this summer to Los Angeles, where she had a clerkship with Stephen Reinhardt, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge and liberal icon, but he suddenly died in March. Instead, Ms. Khan is set to start a fellowship at Columbia this fall, and is considering other projects as well. There is no shortage of parties that want her advice on how to reckon with Big Tech.</p><p>  ''As consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,'' she said. ''But as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.''</p><p>  At the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June.</p><p>  Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes.</p><p>  The hearings will begin on Sept. 13 at Georgetown University Law Center. Two panels will debate whether antitrust should keep its narrow focus or, as Ms. Khan urges, expand its range.</p><p>  ''Ideas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,'' she said. ''We're finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it.''</p><p>  Genuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. ''It's rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,'' he said. ''Nothing about her career is typical. You don't see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly.''</p><p>  Then: Rockefeller. Now: Bezos.</p><p>  Ida Tarbell, the journalist whose investigation of Standard Oil helped bring about its breakup, wrote this about John D. Rockefeller in 1905:</p><p>  ''It takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller's most impressive characteristics is patience. ... He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.''</p><p>  When Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos.</p><p>  Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan's view, a company like Amazon -- one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done -- has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition.</p><p>  ''The long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation -- factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,'' she wrote.</p><p>  The issue Ms. Khan's article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined.</p><p>  ''It's one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,'' said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn't agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. ''It's a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking 'bigness.' ''</p><p>  As Mr. Crane writes in a forthcoming law review article: ''Antitrust law stands at its most fluid and negotiable moment in a generation.''</p><p>  The resistance is fierce and prominent. Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, wrote that if companies like Amazon are targeted simply because their low prices hurt competitors, we might ''quickly drive the economy back into the Stone Age, imposing hysterical costs on everyone.''</p><p>  Timothy Muris, a former chairman of the F.T.C., and Jonathan Nuechterlein, a former F.T.C. general counsel, published a paper in June that was a response to Ms. Khan and the antitrust reform movement. Called ''Antitrust in the Internet Era,'' it was about the A.&amp;P. grocery chain.</p><p>  A.&amp;P. essentially invented the modern supermarket in the 1920s. With its low prices, wide range of products and penchant for disruption, the chain became the leading retailer of its era. It owned 70 factories and eliminated middlemen, which allowed it to keep costs down. Yet, Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein wrote, ''A.&amp;P.'s very popularity triggered a backlash.'' The government pursued A.&amp;P. on antitrust grounds during the 1940s, egged on by competitors that could not compete. After decades of decline, A.&amp;P. shut its doors for good in 2015.</p><p>  The analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don't let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&amp;P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned.</p><p>  ''Amazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,'' they wrote. ''It is a brilliant innovator'' whose ''breakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers.''</p><p>Amazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn't surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: ''We approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story'' of A.&amp;P., ''and we gratefully acknowledge its support.'' They added at the end of footnote 85: ''The authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues.''</p><p>Amazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement.</p><p>  ''We operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,'' the company said. ''Retail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail.''</p><p>  'We're at the Very Beginning of Solutions to This'</p><p>  The first time Ms. Khan held power to account involved a Starbucks in suburban New York that was banning students from sitting down. Ms. Khan decided to write an article about the policy; Starbucks wouldn't answer her questions, but she managed to interview the employees. The New York Times picked up on the tempest, leaning on her reporting. Ms. Khan was 15, a correspondent for her high school newspaper.</p><p>  Her father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything.</p><p>  ''We were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,'' said Amanda Korman, a classmate.</p><p>  Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization's Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. ''It's so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,'' said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist.</p><p>  Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work.</p><p>  In the summer of 2017, Open Markets was ejected from New America amid messy accusations that it displeased Google, a prominent funder, after the company was rebuked by European regulators for anticompetitive behavior. The think tank is now independent.</p><p>  ''Polls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, 'Do we have a monopoly problem?' they answer, 'I don't know,' '' said Mr. Lynn. ''They don't have the language for it.''</p><p>Amazon's $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods in the summer of 2017 -- a startling move into physical retail -- was almost a watershed, but not quite. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, called for hearings but did not get them.</p><p>  ''The whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,'' Mr. Cicilline said. ''Wages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we're trying to do is create a level playing field, and that's harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors.'' He added, ''We're at the very beginning of solutions to this.''</p><p>  Somewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen's ''Persuasion,'' because he hadn't reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy.</p><p>  'The New Brandeisians' Lacks a Certain Something</p><p>  The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan's strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn't give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else.</p><p>  That presented an opening for the reformers' critics, who have tried with a limited degree of success to popularize the term ''Hipster Antitrust.'' Konstantin Medvedovsky, an antitrust lawyer in New York, came up with the label last summer in a tweet that was responding to a tweet that was responding to a tweet by Ms. Khan.</p><p>  ''Antitrust Hipsterism,'' he wrote. ''Everything old is cool again.''</p><p>  Mr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan's article ''the face of this movement,'' said the term was designed to be ''playful rather than pejorative.''</p><p>  Admirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than ''Hipster Antitrust.''</p><p>  The April issue of the journal Antitrust Chronicle, edited by Mr. Medvedovsky, features a drawing of a bearded man on the cover right above the words ''Hipster Antitrust.'' In the middle of an article by Philip Marsden, a professor of competition law and economics at the College of Europe in Bruges, there's a photograph of a bearded man taking a selfie next to the chapter heading ''Battle of the Beards.'' It is perhaps relevant that only one of the 12 authors or experts in the issue is female.</p><p>  The Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment.</p><p>  Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about.</p><p>  Mr. Chopra, with Ms. Khan's assistance, pushed the argument further on Sept. 6 with a 14-page official comment that suggested the F.T.C. bring back a tool buried in its toolbox: the ability to make rules.</p><p>  Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would ''advance clarity and certainty'' about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition.</p><p>  These rules would not be ''some inflexible prescription'' but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic.</p><p>  There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan's notion that the past can help rescue the future.</p><p>  ''These are new technologies and new business models,'' Ms. Khan said. ''The remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles.''</p><p>  Antitrust Foot Soldiers</p><p>  Big Tech's great strength is that it is everywhere. Hardly anyone can live without it. But that omnipresence can be a weakness too. Just ask Facebook. It was the only global social media network, an enviable position -- until it wasn't. Ideas for regulating Facebook that were once unimaginable are now on the table.</p><p>  Ms. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. ''Amazon is not the problem -- the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,'' she said.</p><p>  From Amazon's point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility ''could make sense.'' She also said it ''could make sense'' to treat Amazon's e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network -- all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis.</p><p>  Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them.</p><p>  Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. ''What is really interesting to you?'' her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up -- yes, there are such things -- that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer's tight grip. ''Amazon is scary!'' she exclaimed.</p><p>  This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan's paper.</p><p>  ''I finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,'' Ms. Tsuna said. ''Lina Khan gave me the confidence I needed.'' The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus.</p><p>  That's the way movements begin. Little things grow.</p><p>  ''This is a moment in time that invites a movement,'' said Ms. Khan. ''It's bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It's about whether the laws serve democratic ends.''</p><p>  It was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all.</p><p>  ''Amazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,'' said her husband, Dr. Ali. ''I learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed.''</p><p>  ''I throw myself into things,'' Ms. Khan agreed. ''My life is spread out now.''</p><p>  With some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information.</p><p>  Somewhat to her surprise, she is becoming a public figure. Before beginning her stint at the F.T.C., she said the news of her working there might be no more than a sentence or two at news sites that cover policy intensively. Instead it was a full-fledged story. The Information, a tech news site, declared: ''Amazon Antitrust Push Slowly Gains Ground.'' Politico just named her one of the Politico 50, its annual list of the people driving the ideas driving politics.</p><p>  Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible.</p><p>  ''I don't think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I'm also wary of hubris,'' Ms. Khan said. ''Nobody has been expecting this to succeed. I'm awed by the challenge.''</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

At this point, only a major rewrite of the industrial era antitrust statutes can bring the tech titans to heel.</p><p>The outlines of such a revision are contained in a number of written submissions made to the House antitrust subcommittee, including one by a dozen of the country's top antitrust economists and lawyers who conclude that \"current antitrust doctrines are too limited to adequately protect competition ... or stop anticompetitive conduct.\" They lay out a series of changes in the law to reverse a series of court rulings that have opened the door to over-consolidation in virtually every sector of the economy, nowhere more so than in tech, where there is a natural tendency of customers to want use the same software, communicate on the same network or transact business on the same platform as everyone else.</p><p>While this \"network effect\" explains much of the winner-take-all competition in the tech sector, mergers and acquisitions have also played a role. The four companies represented at Wednesday's hearings, along with Microsoft, have collectively bought 720 companies over the last 30 years, according to testimony from the American Antitrust Institute. </p><p>Google's purchase of YouTube and Waze, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's purchase of Zappos and Ring - all of these were given the green light by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Hundreds of other deals were too small even to be reviewed. In only one of those 720 did the government move to block the deal - Google's purchase of travel software firm ITA - only to be rebuffed in court.</p><p>\"We went from an antitrust culture [in the 1970s] where \"the government always wins\" to one where enforcers almost always lost, or where fear of losing caused the government not to act at all,\" wrote Bill Baer, who headed the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Obama administration, in his submission to the House subcommittee.</p><p>The economic premise behind the decades-long retreat from antitrust enforcement - much of it originating at the economics departments of the University of Chicago and the law school at George Mason University - is that three firms are sufficient to provide competition in any market, monopolies are only temporary and that mergers create efficiencies that are reliably passed on to consumers in lower prices. Business practices restricting customers or disadvantaging competitors -bundling products, exclusive contracts, pricing restraints and withholding services from rivals - once considered anti-competitive, are now assumed to be pro-consumer. And in deciding whether to block a merger or outlaw business practices, judges no longer take a broad look at the competitive landscape, but rely on technical economic analyses of how much prices will go up or down.</p><p>A reformed and modernized antitrust law would reject all of these presumptions, reverse those rulings and make clear that under-enforcement of the antitrust laws is a greater risk to the vibrancy of the American economy than over-enforcement.</p><p>For starters, there should once again be some bright lines  that should rarely, if ever, be crossed. Companies with more than 40 or 50 percent market share should be prevented from buying any direct competitor, no matter how small, to protect current and potential competition. </p><p>Dominant firms in highly concentrated markets should also be barred from buying any company in an adjacent market, particularly ones that are also high concentrated. Such a provision would have prevented pharmacist CVS from buying health insurer Aetna, the AT&amp;T phone company from buying the cable company Time Warner and Ticketmaster buying concert promoter Live Nation.</p><p>In highly concentrated markets, the legal burden should be with the companies to demonstrate that a merger or business practice would not reduce competition, rather than on the government to prove that it would - a huge difference in the world of antitrust litigation. In arguing its case, the government would be required to show only that a merger or business practice poses a credible risk of reducing competition, well short of the current burden to prove that competitive harm is likely or probable, or all but certain.</p><p>A 21st century antitrust law would also make clear to judges that the purpose of antitrust law is to protect and enhance competition not only because it lowers prices, increases choice and improves quality for consumers, but also because it stimulates innovation, reduces income inequality and reduces the concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>Recent court decisions, more narrowly, have declared that competition is enhanced by anything that benefits consumers, and what benefits consumers is lower prices. But in an economy in which some companies give away their services free (think Facebook and Google), a merger or business practice can reduce competition without raising prices. And in markets where companies serve multiple sets of customers (think credit card companies and their cardholders and merchants), what benefits some customers might harm others. Judges need to be reminded that economic efficiency is not the holy grail.</p><p>\"In the search for quantification and scientific precision, economists have taken to defining too narrowly what competition means and how it should be measured,\" said John Kwoka, an economist at Northeastern University.</p><p>A broader analysis of competition would require judges and regulators to consider how U.S. prices compare to foreign prices and how profit margins company valuations compare to those similar industries. It would also look at the pace of innovation in the industry, the degree of competition among suppliers and distributors, the frequency with which companies enter the market, the power companies have over workers and suppliers and the prevalence of restrictive business practices.</p><p>In a more aggressive antitrust environment, firms justifying acquisitions on the basis of operating efficiencies and lower prices would be required to provide annual updates on whether those efficiencies and price declines were realized. That would allow judges and regulators to assess the reliability of such claims, which in most cases are grossly exaggerated. And judges should be given the authority to appoint independent economists to evaluate the economic analyses submitted by companies and regulators.</p><p>This would not be the first time that Congress has been needed to step in to revive and update the antitrust law - it happened in 1914, 1936, 1950 and 1976. Given our polarized political environment, it will take a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress to do it again.</p><p>There is urgency to this project. As we dither, European regulators have already taken the lead in trying to rein in the business practices of the tech giants, imposing billion-dollar fines and prompting complaints that their aim is to hamstring their transatlantic rivals. As we are discovering with other policy issues, the dysfunction of our public sector has begun to seriously erode the capacity of our private sector to adapt and innovate. The rest of the world is not about to wait while we get our act together.</p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>Uber-Postmates merger will only deliver bad tidings for restaurants, customers</p><p>Big agencies and studios have a lock on Hollywood.

It's powerful because, more often than not, it's wrong. When investors get heated about a stock and a trade gets crowded, there's a often money to be made on the other side of it. (That's one of the tenants of<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-key-tools-contrarian-investor.html\">contrarian investing</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But don't just take my word for it. The data backs it up too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last decade, buying the most hated and heavily shorted large- and mid-cap stocks (the top two quartiles of all shortable stocks by market capitalization) would have beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 9.28% each and every year. That's some material outperformance during a decade when decent returns were very hard to come by. So how do you cash in this month?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-toxic-stocks-sell-now.html-5\">&gt;&gt;5 Toxic Stocks to Sell Now</url></p><p>When I say that investors \"hate\" a stock, I'm talking about its short interest. A stock with a high level of shorting indicates that there are a lot of people willing to bet on a decline in its share price -- and not many willing to buy. Too much hate can spur a short squeeze, a buying frenzy that's triggered by short sellers who need to cover their losing bets. And with the S&amp;P 500 within grabbing distance of all-time highs, you can probably guess that there are lots of losing open short bets feeling the squeeze right now.</p><p>One of the best indicators of just how high a short-squeezed stock could go is the short interest ratio, which estimates the number of days it would take for short-sellers to cover their positions. The higher the short ratio, the higher the potential profits when the shorts get squeezed.</p><p>It's worth noting, though, that market cap matters a lot -- short sellers tend to be right about smaller names, with micro-caps delivering negative returns when the same method was used.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-ready-breakouts.html-1\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Ready for Breakouts</url></p><p>Today, we'll replicate the most lucrative side of this strategy with a look at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/short-squeezes-for-the-week-ending-march-25/\">five big-name stocks</url>that short sellers are piled into right now. These stocks could be prime candidates for a short squeeze in the months ahead.</p><p>Cerner</p><p>Large-cap health care IT firm Cerner Corporationis the biggest name on our list -- the firm tips the scales with a $20 billion market capitalization. But a blue-chip valuation isn't enough to spare the firm from short sellers. With a short interest ratio of 11, it would take two full weeks of buying pressure for short sellers to exit their bets against this stock.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-big-tech-stocks-trade-gains.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Big Tech Stocks to Trade for Gains</url></p><p>More than a third of U.S. hospitals use Cerner's Millennium platform to store everything from patient medical data to financial records. It's not just hospitals either. From pharmacies to physicians' offices, CERN's software and hardware is found in more than 9,300 medical facilities globally. Cerner's platform makes a lot of sense for health providers. Because of its huge footprint in the industry, transitioning new employees with medical office experience takes less time, and the firm benefits from economies of scale in developing new feature sets.</p><p>Another big incentive for facilities is getting paid quicker. Cerner's offerings cut down the administrative steps needed to get practices and hospitals payments from either insurance companies or government programs. That helps lessen the blow of a costly medical IT package. Because use of computerized medical records is now mandated by legislation, Cerner's products are a cost of doing business, not a luxury.</p><p>Between secular tailwinds in the medical industry and new pushes into lower-priced options for smaller medical practices, CERN has open runway ahead of it for growth. Look for a possible short squeeze catalyst in earnings next month.</p><p>Illumina</p><p>Illumina has been a short seller's worst nightmare in 2014. Since the calendar flipped to January, shares of this $19 billion life science stock have rallied more than 33%. That's compared with a broad market that hasn't even rallied a full point over that same period. Zoom out to the past full year, and Illumina's gain widens to a neck-craning 180%. But none of that has stopped short sellers from betting against ILMN; if anything, it's emboldened them.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-rocket-stocks-buy-stocks-test-highs.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Rocket Stocks to Buy as Stocks Test New Highs</url></p><p>With a short interest ratio of 12.58, it would take two and a half weeks of nonstop buying pressure at current volume levels for shorts to get out of their bets on ILMN.</p><p>Illumina manufactures tools for genetic analysis, a space that's been growing quickly in the last few years. Best of all, most of Illumina's products are both high-end and consumable -- they're used to collect and analyze genetic material, and then they're discarded. That, in turn, drives recurring revenues at big fat margins. As more commercially successful genetic therapies come to market, it should help to fuel big boosts in genetic R&amp;D spending, and big boosts in orders for Illumina's offerings.</p><p>From a financial standpoint, Illumina is in good shape, with $164 million in net cash on its balance sheet. To be clear, this stock is far from cheap. It trades for a whopping 172 times trailing year's earnings right now, and that's a big part of why shorts feel so confident in betting against it. But being short ILMN is such a crowded trade that any hint of positive news could set off a squeeze this quarter.</p><p>M&amp;T Bank</p><p>Investors hate M&amp;T Bank right now. There's no other way to explain the hefty short interest ratio of 19.14 in shares right now. At current volume levels, it would take a full month of buying for shorts to cover -- and between one of the industry's bigger dividend payouts and the threat of rising interest rates coming from the Fed right now, short sellers should be feeling pretty uncomfortable heading into the second quarter.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-hot-stocks-trade-or-not.html-11\">&gt;&gt;3 Hot Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url></p><p>M&amp;T Bank is a regional bank with a more-than-regional footprint. The Buffalo, N.Y.-based firm has more than 750 branches spread along the East Coast and an asset base that makes it one of the country's 20 biggest banks. Like other regionals, stricter underwriting standards helped to limit write-offs in the wake of the real estate bubble, and as a result, the firm had a fraction of the underperforming loans that its big bank peers did.</p><p>Regulators have liked MTB's strength from early on -- the fact that the firm got a 2.3% dividend yield approved is evidence of that. If interest rates really do show upward mobility in the intermediate term, so too will the spreads that MTB is able to charge for its services. That's good reason for short sellers to tread lightly in 2014.</p><p>Fastenal</p><p>Don't accuse Fastenal of having an overly-exciting business -- the $14 billion industrial supplier built its business by carrying more than 410,000 different types of fasteners. But the most boring stocks can often be the most lucrative ones, and as the industrial sector heats up, so too do Fastenal's sales.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-stocks-rising-big-volume.html-9\">&gt;&gt;3 Stocks Rising on Big Volume</url></p><p>Fastenal's catalog goes far beyond its namesake fasteners: The firm carries some 585,000 maintenance and repair products in 2,400 retail locations, an inventory and footprint that makes FAST a one-stop shop for its customers. Because of its huge scale, Fastenal can compete on price better than smaller rivals in the fragmented industrial supply industry. And don't think that innovation doesn't exist in this business. New distribution models, such as vending machines in customers' facilities that help better track purchasing, have been a big contributor to Fastenal's year-over-year growth.</p><p>Right now, Fastenal's short interest ratio comes in at 17.27. That's a good indication that short sellers are counting on a slowdown in those revenue and profit growth rates. Since 2010, profits are up more than 67%. But being short FAST looks like a crowded trade in March. Look out for earnings on April 11 as a possible squeeze trigger.</p><p>Coach</p><p>Last up is luxury handbag maker Coach , a company that was the poster-child for organic growth in the void of the Great Recession five years ago. Coach has built a business out of hitting the sweet spot between luxury and price, offering customers attainable luxury without diluting its brand vale. That's a tough tightrope to walk (many once-premium brands have failed at it), and the fact that Coach made it to the other side should secure the firm's growth trajectory for years to come.</p><p>Coach makes and sells handbags and other accessories (such as wallets and umbrellas) through a network of around 550 North American stores and a large presence online and in third party channels like department stores. Emerging markets have been a huge source of growth more recently, as a burgeoning middle class looks to acquire aspirational brand-name merchandise.</p><p>Financials don't get much better than Coach's. The firm carries a nearly $1.3 billion cash and investment position, and no debt. That means that there's enough wherewithal on COH's balance sheet to pay for nearly 10% of the firm's outstanding shares at current price levels.
