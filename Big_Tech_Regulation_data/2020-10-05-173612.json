Open Now[1]  AI has the potential to improve human lives and a company's bottom line, but it can also accelerate inequality and eliminate jobs during the worst U.S. recession on record since the Great Depression. It's that dual promise and peril that led members of the House Budget Committee to hold a hearing today in Congress to discuss the impact of AI on economic recovery, the future of work, and the federal budget. Expert witnesses recommended approaches today ranging from giving people lifelong learner accounts for upskilling to creating regional investment districts or portable benefits. </p><p>Daron Acemoglu warned the committee about the dangers of excessive automation[2]. The MIT professor and economist recently found that every robot replaces 3.3 human jobs[3] in the U.S. In a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Acemoglu detailed how excessive automation looks for ways to replace workers with machines or algorithms but produces few new jobs. Companies are currently incentivized by a U.S. tax code that taxes capital at a lower rate than human labor, policy he said incentivizes companies to replace humans with automation. In practice, this can be an action as simple as replacing a McDonald's worker with a touchscreen. He argues automation has been a drag on the U.S. economy, potentially slowed market productivity[4], and has failed to lead to higher wages for low- and middle-class workers. 'AI is a broad technological platform with great promise. It can be used for helping human productivity and creating new human tasks, but it could exacerbate the same trends if we use it just for automation,' he said. 'Excessive automation is not an inexorable development. It is a result of choices, and we can make different choices.' Also shaping the nature of automation in the economy are Big Tech companies with business models that focus on replacing human labor with algorithms, and priorities enshrined in U.S. government funding. Acemoglu said Congress must also consider factors unseen in data such as the loss of self-worth suffered by a person without a job or how employment impacts the likelihood a person becomes involved in their community. Rep. Bill Flores (R-TX) cautioned against changes to how the government treats capital and labor, saying 'I think we as policymakers need to be very careful about trying to get into adjusting the mix of capital versus labor, because as you said early on chairman Yarmouth[5] the government moves slowly, and I think we as policymakers could end up being well behind where the economy is if we're not careful with that.' It's unclear whether testimony delivered today could influence any particular upcoming piece of legislation but it could impact how members of Congress shape policy related to funding in areas like research and development, national defense, and job retraining. The McKinsey Global Institute predicts AI will drive GDP growth around the world in the decades ahead[6], but studies also find that automation in the workplace is expected to particularly impact Black or Latinx people, who make up a larger percentage of the service economy than other groups. Certain cities, states, and regions[7] are also expected to be disproportionately impacted by the proliferation of AI. About one in three jobs in the U.S. may require some form of retraining due to automation, according to the OECD[8]. On the business side, KPMG report released last[9] year urged company executives to take AI-driven job loss seriously and consider ways to retrain or reskill workers. High-speed broadband access received bipartisan support in the hearing as a way to close the digital divide and ensure widespread access to education, job training, and remote job opportunities. A bill with nearly $80 billion in broadband funding was approved by the House of Representatives in July, but the Senate has not yet taken up the legislation. Helping workers find job or skill training will be an important part of addressing the instability and job loss brought on by AI, said Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) associate director Susan Athey, but historically the United States hasn't done a great job of helping displaced workers impacted by automation. Athey is currently working with the Rhode Island state government on using AI to help people find work. Making people feel comfortable and confident in upskilling recommendations will be an important part of helping people fulfill job training programs and acquire new skills. 'They need to have confidence that if they do make that effort and take that scarce time and money, they will be able to use that to get a new job,' she said. 'I'm optimistic about the future, but we have to be intentional about it, and we actually have to execute and follow through on promises.' Stanford HAI is only a little over a year old, but the organization led by former Google Cloud chief scientists and ImageNet creator Dr. Fei-Fei Li has made multiple policy proposals to Congress. Last fall, Stanford HAI urged the federal government to invest $120 billion[10] in the U.S. AI ecosystem over the next decade with $2 billion in funding for entrepreneurs and innovation, $7 billion for AI research, and $3 billion for education. In June, Stanford HAI joined companies like AWS, Google, and Microsoft to urge the federal government to create a national AI research cloud bill.[11] As is standard in congressional hearings about artificial intelligence, competition between China and the U.S. came up on multiple occasions. Jason Matheny is director of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University and serves on the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), a temporary body formed to provide Congress with military and national security policy recommendations. The group asserts that AI dominance by the United States is vital to U.S. national security Matheny said immigration of highly skilled workers was key to the U.S. winning World War II and the Cold War and that the U.S. maintains an asymmetrical advantage over China today because more AI research talent wants to live and work in the U.S. than they want to live and work in China. National Science Foundation (NSF) data shows that more than half of Masters and Ph.D. level computer scientists[12] in the U.S. today were born abroad. He also named immigration an important part of addressing worker shortages brought on by Baby Boomers leaving the workforce[13]. Matheny named the United States' lead in the semiconductor hardware used to accelerate AI a key advantage over China. 'It will be very difficult for China to match us if we play our cards right,' Matheny said. 'We shouldn't rest on our laurels, but if we pursue policies that strengthen our semiconductor industry while also placing the appropriate controls on the manufacturing equipment that China doesn't have and that China currently doesn't have the ability to produce itself, and is probably a decade away from being able to produce itself, we'll be in a very strong position.' He continued to say in the hearing that the U.S. is still too reliant on semiconductor hardware from abroad and called Intel potentially working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company[14] on advanced manufacturing advanced semiconductors outside the United States 'extremely worrying.' The NSCAI first recommended that Congress invest in public-private partnerships to bring more semiconductor hardware back to the United States[15] earlier this year. On the subject of AI talent or retraining, earlier this summer, the NSCAI recommended creating a government university to produce more trained AI talent that works in the federal government.[16] The NSCAI will issue a final list of recommendations to Congress in spring 2021. For markedly different reasons, members of Congress voiced some criticisms at the hearing today. In her questioning, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX) said 'We're all speaking to haves because the have nots are not in the room,' she said in reference to the fact that the witness list did not include the voices of people impacted by job dislocation or inequality. Last fall, for example, the Federal Trade Commission received a complaint about AI-powered hiring tool HireVue[17] alleging unfair practices and intrusive collection of biometric data. In response to a question from Jackson-Lee, Brookings Institution director of governance studies Darrell Westsaid investment in broadband, telemedicine, and education could help address inequities in tech. 'We're almost in a situation where technology is helping to fuel the inequality in the sense that the haves are doing better and getting tax breaks and have programs that support them, and people at the lower end aren't even in the game. They don't have access to the digital economy,' he said. In his critique, ranking member Steve Womack (R-AK) called the hearing focused on AI interesting and important but said the budget committee would be better served by focusing on how to reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit. Updated projections released by the Congressional Budget Office Wednesday found that the deficit now stands at $3.3 trillion, more than triple what it was in fiscal year 2019 and the highest percentage of debt compared to GDP since 1945[18]. When asked by Rep. Womack how the federal government should prioritize research and development funding, Matheny suggested a focus on areas where private businesses may be likely to underinvest. This includes basic research carried out by groups like DARPA and the National Science Foundation, and testing and evaluation by agencies like the National institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Numerous witnesses testifying before the committee today said the government can use AI to improve government efficiency. 'I do believe it is a good time to start thinking about modernizing federal government infrastructure,' Athey said, adding that cybersecurity, fraud protection, and administrative services are ways the federal government can deliver services. A joint NYU-Stanford study examining federal government use of AI found that only 15% of federal agencies currently use advanced forms of artificial intelligence today.[19] Some government use of AI might result in job loss, but Athey said that job loss could lead to better allocation of human resources for society. 'While that loses a piece of employment for the worker sitting behind the counter, maybe there's other things your government could be doing: More childcare, more eldercare, there are other services that are underprovided where the human workers can be better deployed if we use technology to do things where the human is kind of getting wasted on both sides of the table,' she said. In other recent government regulation and AI news, the Portland City Council passed the strictest facial recognition ban in the United States Wednesday[20]. Businesses and government agencies who fail to comply can face fines of $1,000 per day for each violation of the law.

This is really an independent action by the states, said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, speaking for the 49 other attorneys general also backing the probe. Were not reacting to Congress; were not trying to lead Congress. Were trying to do what we think is right by our consumers. </p><p>But some lawmakers on the other side of the street didnt see it the same way. After months of circular debate on the need for privacy legislation, increased antitrust scrutiny of big tech, and the moderation of online content, they hope the aggressive state actions announced against both Google on Monday and Facebook last Friday will finally light a fire under Congress. I hope it will be a wake-up call to this building to do something on tech, said Sen. Josh Hawley, who as Missouris attorney general opened his own investigation into Google in 2017. There are a lot of things we could do. Ive made a lot of proposals; others have. Its time we move forward. And as lawmakers in both chambers grapple with the role of antitrust law in reining in big tech, experts anticipate the efforts now being pursued by the states will accelerate congressional activity on that issue. I dont think that [lawmakers] want the states to be driving the bus entirely, said Hal Singer, an antitrust expert and economist at Econ One Research. They dont want to play second fiddle; they dont want to be upstaged. Congress has little direct influence to wield when it comes to the conduct of the states antitrust probes into Google and Facebook. But from sharing information to exerting pressure on federal regulators to tightening federal antitrust laws, there are a number of ways that Capitol Hill can still have a significant impact. A number of congressional offices and committees are now engaged in their own antitrust investigations into the tech industry. Chief among them is the probe led by House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, whos promised a top-to-bottom review of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. On Monday, Cicilline told reporters his office would be reaching out shortly to the attorneys general spearheading the state investigations. To the extent that its appropriate to share information, or to learn from what theyre collecting in the course of their own investigationsto the extent that theyre permitted to do that, obviouslyit would be beneficial to our work, he said.  The congressman suggested such collaboration could be a two-way street, with information gathered by his office also being funneled back to the states.  Matt Stoller, a fellow at the progressive Open Markets Institute and an advocate of tougher antitrust enforcement against the tech giants, expects cooperation between the states and Congress to be wide-ranging as both investigations continue.  Theres a kind of synergy there, said Stoller, who suggested the collaboration will extend into congressional hearings where industry officials are present.  Theyre going to ask the witnesses, Why are you saying one thing here and another thing in your antitrust case? he said. Theyre going to ask questions that are really directed to eliciting information that could be helpful to the [AG] investigation. Some lawmakers expect those hearingswhere tech industry representatives are dragged in front of the dais for an hours-long browbeatingto increase in frequency and intensity as a result of the state investigations. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who last month introduced legislation imposing harsher antitrust penalties on tech companies, said the new state probes should spur the Congress to have additional hearings, and to be very aggressive in this area. The same goes for congressional oversight of the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. Blumenthal suggested that Congress should hold those agencies feet to the fire for their inability to act as expeditiously as the states on the antitrust concerns posed by big tech, as well as their failure to publicly join state-led efforts. The federal agencies with responsibility hereboth the FTC and the Department of Justiceshould feel the heat of states in effect leaving them in the dust, Blumenthal said.  Bruce Hoffman, the director of the FTCs Bureau of Competition, is slated to appear at a Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on digital platforms and competition later this month.  Finally, theres an expectation that Congress will scrutinize the state effort against Silicon Valley and search for areas where national antitrust law comes up short.  State attorneys general are so far focusing on Googles alleged discriminatory actions in advertising, where its services are clearly priced. If regulators choose to also examine the consumer-facing side of the tech platformswhere the product is ostensibly freethey may have trouble preparing a successful case.  And its there that congressional assistance, in the form of new antitrust laws, could prove invaluable. If I were in Congress, I would say, Its obvious to me that antitrust can only go so far and weve got an obligation to fill the remaining gaps, Singer said. So Im hoping that thats where theyll come in.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-681410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1N-3391-JBNW-32F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

This year, however, government interest in oversight has spiked: In February the Federal Trade Commission launched a task force[1] to monitor competition in technology markets and review past mergers, and the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice have reportedly reached an agreement[2] to split jurisdiction over the Big Four, with the FTC taking responsibility for any investigations of Facebook and Amazon and the DOJ taking Google and Apple. On the legislative front, the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law has announced a series of hearings[3] on competition in digital markets, promising a 'top-to-bottom review of the market power held by tech giant platforms.' And last Tuesday, DOJ Antitrust Division head Makan Delrahim told the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference in Tel Aviv, Israel[4] that the DOJ was equipped under existing law to combat anticompetitive activity in the digital economy, stressing the particular harms of collusion, exclusivity and tying arrangements, and acquisition of nascent competitors.The uptick in scrutiny follows increasingly aggressive investigation and enforcement actions from European antitrust agencies. </p><p>In 2017, the European Commission fined Google billions of dollars[5] for favoring its own vertically-integrated comparison-shopping service in search results. Last July, after a three-year investigation (which we previously covered[6]), the European Commission levied additional billions in fines[7] for tying Google search services to the Google-developed Android operating system; paying phone manufacturers and networks for exclusive pre-installation of Google search; and barring manufacturers from using versions of Android not approved by Google. And in March, the Commission fined Google billions more[8] after concluding its use of exclusivity or 'Premium Placement' clauses in advertising service contracts illegally impaired competitors' ability to compete.Google is not the only target of European regulators. In February, the German Federal Cartel Office ordered Facebook[9] to stop requiring users to agree that Facebook may aggregate their data collected from Facebook, Facebook-owned platforms like Instagram, and third-party websites; the Office concluded that these mandatory terms illegally leveraged market power to further strengthen Facebook's dominance. Germany is also investigating[10] Amazon's potential abuse of market dominance to impose unfavorable terms on sellers, and both the European Commission[11] and Italy[12] are probing whether Amazon is exploiting its role as host for third-party vendors to its own advantage. And Spotify has filed a complaint[13] with the European Commission alleging that Apple's App Store unfairly advantages developers who use Apple's proprietary payment system.Until recently, oversight of the Big Four in the United States has not focused on alleged antitrust concerns. Rather, enforcement efforts have focused on data security and alleged privacy violations\u2014for example, the FTC has been investigating Facebook[14] for violations of a 2011 privacy consent decree after user data was accessed without authorization by Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook is reportedly readying to pay a fine[15] of between $3 and $5 billion. The express focus of these newly invigorated oversight and investigative efforts is concentration and competition, but it remains unclear to what extent existing antitrust laws will be implicated and what types of conduct, if any, may be targeted for investigation.As to Congress, the House Antitrust Subcommittee has thus far only held a hearing[16] on the consequences of concentration for 'press freedom'\u2014not in itself a traditional focus of the antitrust laws\u2014at which publishers testified that large online platforms' market power permitted them to dictate lower prices for content, and their advertising services enabled platforms to profit off publishers' content while driving traffic to news aggregators. Legislation introduced earlier this year[17] and promoted at the hearing would exempt news content creators from antitrust laws, permitting content creators to cooperatively negotiate content prices with the largest digital platforms.The FTC and DOJ's specific focus, while non-public, is broadly evident from public announcements and news reports. The FTC is reportedly making direct outreach[18] to smaller technology companies for reports of anticompetitive conduct and evidence of anticompetitive mergers. And the past enforcement actions Assistant Attorney General Delrahim invoked in his Tuesday remarks may suggest some of his agency's particular priorities: He cited United States v. Dentsply, which held unlawful a dominant manufacturer's exclusive dealing arrangement with 30 independent dealers because it limited competitors to low market share, and the 1998 prosecution of Microsoft for, among other things, illegally tying its web browser to its operating system. It may be no coincidence that Google was faulted by the European Commission for allegedly 'tying' Google search to Android and imposing exclusivity terms in contracts involving both Google search services and the Android OS. In fact, the DOJ is reportedly already preparing its investigation[19] of Google's 'business practices related to its search and other businesses.'The DOJ may also be guided by the FTC's earlier, 2011-2012 investigation of Google, during which FTC staff preliminarily concluded[20] that, among other things, Google (1) favored its own sites over those of competitors, although it was unlikely a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act given potential procompetitive justifications; (2) unlawfully disadvantaged competitors in the search and search advertising space by imposing contractual restrictions preventing advertisers from using rival advertising platforms; and (3) entered into unlawful, monopoly-enhancing exclusive agreements with websites for search and search advertising services. That investigation, however, ultimately resulted in no enforcement action[21]. As noted above, the European Commission made a different decision in 2017, fining Google billions for favoring its sites at the expense of competitors'.We'll continue to monitor these House hearings, legislative proposals, and DOJ and FTC investigations and provide updates as they unfold.

The companies are four of the six largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S., are considered to dominate their respective markets, and are worth nearly $5 trillion combined.Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, faced some of the most stringent questionings from Antitrust subcommittee members. </p><p>Newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal have recently investigated allegations that the company is pushing independent sellers out of the market by using seller data to develop competing goods. During the Antitrust subcommittee hearing, lawmakers pressed Bezos for answers about whether Amazon ever uses seller data for its own benefit. 'I can't answer that question yes or no,' Bezos said, explaining that Amazon has a policy against using seller data to aid its own private label business, 'but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.'Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, faced a different line of questioning. Lawmakers focused on whether the behemoth search engine company ever favors its own pages and products when returning search results, or whether the company ever uses content from competing services.Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, faced questions about the company's $1 billion acquisition of the Instagram app in 2012. Tim Cook of Apple had to answer allegations that his company uses the Apple App Store to edge out or punish rival companies.The July 29, 2020 hearing was a preliminary step to closing a Congressional antitrust investigation that began a year earlier, in July 2019. The stated purpose of the investigation is to determine whether big tech companies are using monopolistic tactics that lead to a loss of genuine competition and result in public harm.Although the tenor of the hearing made it clear that lawmakers have identified several instances where the four companies may have discriminated against rival companies or bought up the competition, it is less clear whether such actions are significant enough or damaging enough to be considered antitrust violations. Due in August or September of this year, the subcommittee's final report will finalize the subcommittee's investigative findings and its takeaways from the July hearing.The report is expected to answer two questions that remain open-ended after the July hearing. Are Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon engaging in anticompetitive behavior? And, if so, what does the subcommittee recommend Congress do about it? Observers have noted that the subcommittee may recommend heightened regulation or even splitting the tech giants into smaller companies. These actions could have a measurable impact on consumers of the tech giants' services. They could set an essential precedent for assessing the behavior of tech titan companies in the future. For now, it is clear that the tech titans are under scrutiny, and that the companies themselves and general observers alike await the outcome of this scrutiny, which will be conveyed in the findings and recommendations of the subcommittee's final report. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411159787595994925876100249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MP-WMX1-JCMN-Y53J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><timeReceived>10:26 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For the executives, the issue of the companies' market dominance comes at a delicate time \u2014 amid an economic catastrophe that has wiped out businesses large and small while adding billions to the coffers of an industry that critics have dubbed Big Tech. In addition, the hearing on Wednesday culminates a year-long investigation by the House Judiciary Committee into the foursome, which were America's largest companies by market value even before the coronavirus pandemic reached U.S. shores in February.   \"How they interact with smaller vendors and rivals on their platforms, the practices that they use to maintain their market position \u2014 all of that is now under the microscope,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. \"The last hearing was in January, pre-COVID, and I will be particularly interested in how the COVID pandemic will weave through the conversation.\"  For Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, it will be his first time appearing before Congress, while Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai will be making repeat appearances. Although each faces slightly different issues, they will all have to answer charges that their companies reduce competition and harm consumers.   \"All four feel free to crush anyone on their platform that's offering very good competition against them. This has happened again and again,\" said Eleanor Fox, a law professor at New York University who specializes in antitrust and competition policy in summarizing the case against Big Tech. \"They get huge amounts of data from the businesses on the platform, they take more data than they need to conduct business, and they use that to find out what is the new best thing and then they appropriate that thing. They use it to suppress innovative competition of the businesses using the platform.\"  Of late, meanwhile, Amazon has been lifted by the pandemic. The online retailer notched record sales in the first quarter, pulling in the equivalent of $10,000 a second   But for years, more than half of its sales have come from products other people sell on Amazon's platform\u2014 not products it sells itself. That has led to accusations that Amazon plays hardball with small businesses, extracting high fees and using data it gleans from third-party sellers to undermine them.   A coalition of labor unions last week filed a complaint against Amazon with the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that the ecommerce company controls prices on its platform, ties product rankings to whether sellers purchase other products and uses their data to promote its own products. The FTC is reportedly investigating Amazon, as are at least two states, according to media reports.   \"Amazon's ability to mine information from sellers that gives it a competitive advantage is a dynamic that's just not in keeping with the notion of a fair and open market,\" Stacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, said in a recent phone call. Mitchell is calling for Amazon to split its marketplace from its direct-sales platform.   For its part, Amazon maintains that it does not compete with its sellers, last week releasing a report highlighting the number of small businesses that use and benefit from its platform.  The last time Sundar Pichai, the head of Alphabet-owned Google, spoke before Congress, the questioning focused on allegations of political bias in the search company's products and whether Google planned to launch a product in China, which the CEO denied.  This time, the focus is likely to be on the company's role in advertising. That's the main thrust of a lawsuit the Department of Justice is reportedly considering against the search giant. Google controls about 80% of the market for search advertising, according to eMarketer, and has been accused of stifling competition from other ad placement services.   \"It's like a broker for advertising next to the search results, and it won't let anyone else be that broker,\" Fox said.  Google has rebutted such assertions, noting that there are \"thousands\" of companies that sell advertising.   Facebook, too, will likely have to answer lawmaker questions about advertising. The company takes in more than 80% of social-media ad spending and nearly 60% of political spending, according to eMarketer.   Facebook has also drawn fire for declining to on its platform, instead pointing out that such spots aren't as popular   Lawmakers will also likely scrutinize Facebook's recent acquisitions, including the GIF-sharing platform Giphy, which it purchased for $400 million in May, as well as its user privacy practices.   Unlike Amazon and Facebook, Apple has mostly managed to avoid allegations of unfair competition and abusive data collection practices. But software developers have accused the company of demanding heavy concessions in order to sell their products in its popular app store. Apple demands between 15% and 30% of a developer's sales, although it maintains that cut is in line with market prices.   Congress' investigation into Big Tech is running in parallel with probes by the Trump administration as well as efforts by state attorneys general. The House antitrust committee could use its findings to lean on the administration; alternatively, it could pass laws to rein in tech companies.  A wholesale breakup is unlikely because such an effort would likely end up in court, where the bar to prove market dominance is high, Fox said. Since the 1980s, courts have considered antitrust cases chiefly in terms of whether a company's behavior harms consumers, in particular by raising prices. Without tangible proof that a company is doing so, showing that its behavior is anticompetitive becomes difficult.   \"In court, [tech companies] have a really good chance of saying, 'We don't have any duties to people on the platform, let them go somewhere else,'\" Fox said. \"They have a chance of winning even on that point because of how conservative the Supreme Court is.\"   Congress also could seek to more tightly regulate tech companies without breaking them up, said Moss of the American Antitrust Institute. \"The most considered proposal would be something along the lines of creating a digital technology act.\"  \"What we're seeing here is the emergence of a real multidimensional problem. The platforms raise not just economic problems, but social issues,\" she said. \"Antitrust is absolutely a tool when it comes to competition issues, but it may not be the best tool for privacy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42702925191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FW-YM61-F07F-832C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CBS News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They will present their testimonies virtually, according to sources familiar with their plans.</p><p>The panel is questioning the companies as part of its probe into whether they actively work to harm and eliminate smaller rivals, while not always making the best choices for their customers.</p><p>The high-profile hearing, which will bring together Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai, will be a key moment in the growing backlash against Big Tech in the U.S. and is likely to set up a faceoff between the executives and skeptical lawmakers from both parties.</p><p>Apple is likely to be quizzed about the way it manages its app store after facing criticisms it hurts newcomers. Apple told Reuters it will argue it does not have controlling market share for apps. The iPhone maker views its store as a feature designed to ensure the security and reliability of its phones.</p><p>Apple will address issues such as the approval process for the app store - long a sore point with developers who have said their apps are held up without warning - and allegations it does not share key functions such as data about the phone's location.</p><p>The other companies will also contend they still face plenty of competition.</p><p>A source said Amazon's Jeff Bezos is likely to talk about the options consumers have for online purchases and how the coronavirus pandemic has boosted e-commerce overall - including for large retail rivals such as Walmart.</p><p>He is also expected to talk about small sellers on its third-party marketplace platform and \"how they have continued to thrive despite competition from Amazon,\" the source added. Amazon has come under scrutiny on how it uses data from small sellers to benefit its own business.</p><p>Bezos could also address allegations the company took advantage of the pandemic by limiting inventory sold by small sellers but will stay away from bringing up contentious issues such as the conversation around breaking up the company, the source said.</p><p>Facebook's Zuckerberg will follow a similar tack, another source said. He is expected to argue that the company has strong competitors, including Google and Amazon on the advertising side and Twitter and Tik-Tok in social media.</p><p>Zuckerberg is expected to renew Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized.</p><p>Details of Google's likely arguments were not available. But in recent weeks the firm has published blog posts and a white paper asserting that it still faces plenty of competition and that the fees it charges ad buyers and sellers are justified.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google declined comment.</p><p>\"There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics ... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,\" said Carl Szabo at industry lobby group NetChoice.</p><p>Some industry observers disagreed.</p><p>The U.S. does not have regulations to deal with the practices employed by large tech companies and the hearing is a key step in that direction, said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p><p>Reuters !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

They will present their testimonies virtually, according to sources familiar with their plans.</p><p>The panel is questioning the companies as part of its probe into whether they actively work to harm and eliminate smaller rivals, while not always making the best choices for their customers.</p><p>The high-profile hearing, which will bring together Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai, will be a key moment in the growing backlash against Big Tech in the U.S. and is likely to set up a faceoff between the executives and skeptical lawmakers from both parties.</p><p>Apple is likely to be quizzed about the way it manages its app store after facing criticisms it hurts newcomers. Apple told Reuters it will argue it does not have controlling market share for apps. The iPhone maker views its store as a feature designed to ensure the security and reliability of its phones.</p><p>Apple will address issues such as the approval process for the app store - long a sore point with developers who have said their apps are held up without warning - and allegations it does not share key functions such as data about the phone's location.</p><p>The other companies will also contend they still face plenty of competition.</p><p>A source said Amazon's Jeff Bezos is likely to talk about the options consumers have for online purchases and how the coronavirus pandemic has boosted e-commerce overall - including for large retail rivals such as Walmart.</p><p>He is also expected to talk about small sellers on its third-party marketplace platform and \"how they have continued to thrive despite competition from Amazon,\" the source added. Amazon has come under scrutiny on how it uses data from small sellers to benefit its own business.</p><p>Bezos could also address allegations the company took advantage of the pandemic by limiting inventory sold by small sellers but will stay away from bringing up contentious issues such as the conversation around breaking up the company, the source said.</p><p>Facebook's Zuckerberg will follow a similar tack, another source said. He is expected to argue that the company has strong competitors, including Google and Amazon on the advertising side and Twitter and Tik-Tok in social media.</p><p>Zuckerberg is expected to renew Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized.</p><p>Details of Google's likely arguments were not available. But in recent weeks the firm has published blog posts and a white paper asserting that it still faces plenty of competition and that the fees it charges ad buyers and sellers are justified.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google declined comment.</p><p>\"There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics ... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,\" said Carl Szabo at industry lobby group NetChoice.</p><p>Some industry observers disagreed.</p><p>The U.S. does not have regulations to deal with the practices employed by large tech companies and the hearing is a key step in that direction, said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The iPhone maker views its store as a feature designed to ensure the security and reliability of its phones.</p><p>Apple will address issues such as the approval process for the app store - long a sore point with developers who have said their apps are held up without warning - and allegations it does not share key functions such as data about the phone's location.</p><p>The other companies will also contend they still face plenty of competition.</p><p>A source said Amazon's Jeff Bezos is likely to talk about the options consumers have for online purchases and how the coronavirus pandemic has boosted e-commerce overall - including for large retail rivals such as Walmart.</p><p>He is also expected to talk about small sellers on its third-party marketplace platform and \"how they have continued to thrive despite competition from Amazon,\" the source added. Amazon has come under scrutiny on how it uses data from small sellers to benefit its own business.</p><p>Bezos could also address allegations the company took advantage of the pandemic by limiting inventory sold by small sellers but will stay away from bringing up contentious issues such as the conversation around breaking up the company, the source said.</p><p>Facebook's Zuckerberg will follow a similar tack, another source said. He is expected to argue that the company has strong competitors, including Google and Amazon on the advertising side and Twitter and Tik-Tok in social media.</p><p>Zuckerberg is expected to renew Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized.</p><p>Details of Google's likely arguments were not available. But in recent weeks the firm has published blog posts and a white paper asserting that it still faces plenty of competition and that the fees it charges ad buyers and sellers are justified.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google declined comment.</p><p>\"There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics ... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,\" said Carl Szabo at industry lobby group NetChoice.</p><p>Some industry observers disagreed.</p><p>The U.S. does not have regulations to deal with the practices employed by large tech companies and the hearing is a key step in that direction, said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This must end.\"</p><p>It is not clear what antitrust actions may come out of the hearings, which were heated at times and ranged in topic from claims of anti-conservative bias among social media platforms to unlawful acquisitions and the spread of misinformation. The hearings were conducted partially in person on the Hill and partially over video messenger amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>                   The questions                   </p><p>Much of the questioning of Mark Zuckerberg focused on Facebook's history of acquiring or copying main features of competitor platforms. Jerry Nadler of New York argued in his questioning that Facebook's acquisition of Instagram had all the hallmarks of an antitrust violation.</p><p>\"This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent, and this should never have happened in the first place. It should never have been permitted to happen. It cannot happen again,\" he said.</p><p>In one particularly intense exchange, Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, asked the CEO if Facebook had ever \"threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company\".</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that it had not. Jayapal followed up by reading evidence that suggested the Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom felt he had no option but to sell his platform to Facebook.</p><p>\"Facebook is a case study, in my opinion, in monopoly power,\" Jayapal said. \"Because your company harvests and monetizes our data, then your company uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire and kill rivals. Facebook's very model makes it impossible for new companies to flourish separately, and that harms our democracy, it has harms mom-and-pop businesses and it harms consumers.\"</p><p>Criticisms of Amazon focused primarily on third-party sellers on the online retail platform. Lucy McBath, a Georgia Democrat, played emotional testimony from a woman who said her bookstore on Amazon was throttled by the company's anti-competitive behavior when she was delisted from the site.</p><p>McBath also questioned Apple over allegations the company has removed competitors' apps from its App Store. She said creators of screen time management apps alleged that Apple removed their apps from the store right after launching its own, similar app. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, denied the allegation.</p><p>\"The timing of the removals seems very coincidental,\" McBath pointed out. \"If Apple wasn't attempting to harm competitors in order to help its own app, why did Phil Schiller, who runs the App Store, promote the Screen Time app to customers who complained about the removal of rival parental control apps?\" </p><p>Sundar Pichai of Google was targeted with questions about the company's advertising methods, data practices and use of other companies' content for its own pages. Jayapal asked Pichai how Google could be anything but a monopoly if it controlled more than 90% of the global online search market.</p><p>Cicilline accused Google of stealing content from small businesses, calling the practices \"anticompetitive\". He described Google as a \"walled garden\" that traps users.</p><p>\"I disagree with this characterization,\" the CEO responded, noting that Google \"supports\" 1.4m small businesses.</p><p>                   The non-answers                   </p><p>For as much ground as was covered on Wednesday, the tech executives also gave many non-answers. Zuckerberg initially claimed not to know about Facebook's controversial \"Research\" app and later had to amend his statement on the record.</p><p>Bezos frequently claimed not to know Amazon policies on data collection and other issues he was asked by Congress members. The failure to answer or give details on Amazon's actions on Wednesday revealed Bezos \"seemed to be unaware of the widespread harms that Amazon inflicts\", said Dania Rajendra, director of Athena, a non-profit group of activists against Amazon's centralized power.</p><p>\"Today's non-answers from Jeff Bezos prove that he lacks the will or competence to change Amazon through his own leadership,\" Rajendra said. \"It is now up to the subcommittee to take what they've learned and issue a strong set of recommendations to meaningfully check Amazon's out-of-control power. The future of our economy and our democracy depend on it.\"</p><p>                                        Republicans take on Silicon Valley's politics                                      </p><p>Meanwhile, many Republican lawmakers used the hearing as an opportunity to air grievances about what they perceive as bias against conservatives in the tech industry.</p><p>The stage was set for such questioning early in the day, when Jim Jordan, a Republican of Ohio, dedicated his opening statements not to antitrust topics but to concern over bias.</p><p>\"I will just cut to the chase - big tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said. </p><p>Several lawmakers asked Zuckerberg about a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/29/tech-hearings-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-amazon-jeff-bezos-apple-tim-cook-google-sundar-pichai-congress\">viral video</url> that, without offering proof, suggested hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus and had been taken down from Facebook. Zuckerberg reiterated that Facebook's policies \"prohibit content that will lead to imminent risk of harm\", including unproven health treatments.</p><p>Later in the hearing, Jordan asked each executive what he thought of \"cancel culture\" and the idea that differing viewpoints are now shot down or discouraged. All executives agreed that a diversity of viewpoints is important.</p><p>Republicans' insistence on returning to the topic of anti-conservative bias led to some clashes with Democratic lawmakers. A verbal scuffle broke out when Representative Mary Gay Scanlon opened her questioning with a sharp criticism of Congressman Greg Steube and other Republicans.</p><p>\"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64822624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-JT41-JCJY-G0Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1062\"/><timeReceived>2:47 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

NRB is alarmed \"at the ever growing examples of censorship of Christian and conservative viewpoints online, largely at the behest of small yet dominant groups of cultural elites,\" said CEO Jerry Johnson. NRB sent letters to Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter asking they use the same standards for speech as the First Amendment, drawing the line only at speech that \"threatens violence\" or \"spews obscenity\" without \"trampling on free speech liberties.\"</p><p>Former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell, former Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, support the effort. Big tech is \"behaving like the petty tyrants on college campuses,\" Cruz said, suggesting Congress should cease treating companies like Facebook as impartial public forums that aren't liable for the speech and users they host. The companies are acting as \"political players,\" Cruz said.</p><p>\"Twitter as a platform is impartial, and we believe strongly in impartiality,\" a representative said. The other companies and the Internet Association didn't comment.</p><p>Johnson cited Twitter for blocking an advertisement from Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., in which she talked about fighting Planned Parenthood and blocking the sale of infant body parts. Twitter eventually reversed the block and allowed the ad, which was announcing Blackburn's Senate campaign launch, to play. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, defending against net neutrality rule change criticism (see 1712070069), also has lamented this (see 1712060058). \"Diverse perspectives are present every day and treated equally so users can see every side, and the Twitter Rules apply to everyone equally,\" Twitter's rep emailed. NRB cited Facebook's news feed curation, the pulling of a Christian app from the iTunes store, and age restrictions on conservative YouTube videos.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley has the power to put its thumb on the scale,\" said Cruz, in a speech on the importance of freedom of expression and freedom of religion. If tech companies are censoring conservative content on their platforms, they aren't neutral public forums, and rules that protect such forums from legal liability should no longer apply, Cruz said.</p><p>Speakers distinguished their concerns from those in the FCC's upcoming action on net neutrality. Cruz condemned the previous administration's classification of the internet under Communications Act Title II as a \"lawless\" attempt to regulate the internet, and said tech companies supported it because regulations favor entrenched incumbents. By shining a light on tech actions, NRB will help market forces motivate the companies to cease interfering with access to conservative content, McDowell said.</p><p>\"I'm wary of the government trying to come in and balance speech on any issue,\" McDowell said, cautioning NRB it would be a bad idea to seek government action to correct the matter. \"We are not at this time calling for new laws or regulations; indeed we are very cautious about heavy-handed government regulations dangerous to speech and innovation,\" said Johnson.</p><p>By temporarily blocking Blackburn's ad, Twitter limited access to exactly the kind of speech that should be \"sacrosanct,\" an announcement of political candidacy, Reed said. \"She was referring to her attempts to enforce the law.\" Free speech is essential to conduct of a healthy democracy, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R4F-3931-JC8G-81Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 08, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NATIONAL RELIGIOUS BROADCASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>CHRISTIAN COALITION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, Congressional Democrats are offering up an Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, an expansive and ambitious new take on how to regulate automated decision-making. Whether or not it becomes law, it's a necessary effort to reassert human control as opaque algorithms take over bureaucratic processes.</p><p>Algorithms are being used everywhere: in credit decisions, mortgages, insurance rates, who gets a job, which kids get into college, and how long criminal defendants go to prison to name a few proliferating examples. Messy, complicated human decisions are being made, typically without an explanation or a chance to appeal, by artificial intelligence systems. They provide efficiency, profitability, and, often, a sense of scientific precision and authority.</p><p>The problem is that this authority has been bestowed too hastily. Algorithms are increasingly found to be making mistakes. Whether it's a sexist hiring algorithm developed by Amazon, conspiracy theories promoted by the Google search engine or an IBM facial-recognition program that didn't work nearly as well on black women as on white men, we've seen that large companies that pride themselves on their technical prowess are having trouble navigating this terrain.</p><p>And if that's what we know about, imagine what we don't. Most of the critically important algorithms in use have not been opened up for scrutiny, in large part because of laws protecting intellectual property.</p><p>The Democratic bill, introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives last week, would give the Federal Trade Commission power to require and monitor procedures by big companies to keep track of their algorithms and audit them for fairness and accuracy. It would apply only to companies with at least $50 million in annual revenue and would pertain even if intellectual property rights are involved, although it looks like the companies would have leeway in terms of whether they make the audits publicly available.</p><p>The idea is that obvious mistakes, or indeed subtle detours around existing anti-discrimination law, should be caught before they're embedded in computer programs for deployment. (To its credit, Amazon.com Inc. didn't use its sexist hiring algorithm.) Instead of assuming the best, in other words, companies will be required to provide evidence to the FTC that they follow relevant laws against discrimination. The inquiries would be done via third party auditors. (Disclosure: I run an algorithmic auditing company.) Companies would need to provide evidence that new algorithms are fair and accurate before being allowed to use them. This would be a huge step forward in terms of accountability, and is far from the case today.</p><p>Whatever the legislative fate of the Democratic bill, it's an indication of what is to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-0000016a-301c-d444-a5fb-bbfe68260000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX8-WB41-F06X-W1XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

''We should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, and perhaps we will,'' President Trump recently declared. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has made the breakup of tech companies a central plank of her campaign. Even Silicon Valley-friendly contenders like Pete Buttigieg have called for curbs on the industry's power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If Americans buy into the idea that the tech industry is an entrepreneurial, free-market miracle in which government played little part, then the prospect of stricter regulation is ominous. But that isn't what actually happened. Throughout the history of the tech industry in the United States, the government has been an important regulator, funder and partner. Public policies -- including antitrust enforcement, data privacy regulation and rules governing online content -- helped make the industry into the innovative juggernaut that it is today. In recent years, lawmakers pulled back from this role. As they return to it, the history of American tech delivers some important lessons. </p><p>  Advocates of big-tech breakup often point to precedent set by the antitrust cases of the twentieth century. The three biggest were Microsoft in the 1990s, IBM in the 1950s through the 1980s, and the moves that turned AT&amp;T into a regulated monopoly in 1913 and ended with its breakup seven decades later. Microsoft and IBM didn't break up, and even AT&amp;T's dissolution happened partly because the company wanted the freedom to enter new markets.</p><p>  What made these cases a boon to tech innovation was not the breaking up -- which is hard to do -- but the consent decrees resulting from antitrust action. Even without forcing companies to split into pieces, antitrust enforcement opened up space for market competition and new growth. Consent decrees in the mid-1950s required both IBM and AT&amp;T to license key technologies for free or nearly free. These included the transistor technology foundational to the growth of the microchip industry: We would have no silicon in Silicon Valley without it. Microsoft dominated the 1990s software world so thoroughly that its rivals dubbed it ''the Death Star.'' After the lawsuit, it entered the new century constrained and cautious, giving more room for new platforms to gain a foothold.</p><p>  Bill Gates observed recently that a ''winner take all'' dynamic governs tech, encouraging only one product -- IBM mainframes, Microsoft Windows, the Apple iPhone -- to monopolize its market. History shows that he's right, and that the actions of government have been a critical countervailing force.</p><p>  Enforcement, however, needs to be savvy about the technology itself. When Congress first took up the issue of computer privacy in the 1960s, its focus was on the information-gobbling mainframe computers of the federal government. Lawmakers paid little attention to what private industry was doing, or could do, with personal data. And they had little inkling of what could happen when such databases became part of a networked communications system.</p><p>  Had they paid closer attention to some of the experts on computing at the time, they might have acted differently. Paul Baran, a pioneering computer scientist, warned at a 1966 hearing about the dangers of networked computers. ''Even a little information improperly used can do irrevocable harm,'' he said. ''Information is readily counterfeited. It can be quickly reproduced and widely transmitted very cheaply.'' Baran knew what he was talking about; a few years later, he helped design the internet. The detailed prescriptions he offered that day -- basic encryption of all files, random external audits, mechanisms to detect abnormal information requests -- could have altered the trajectory of the online world.</p><p>  Technology will always move faster than lawmakers are able to regulate. The answer to the dilemma is to listen to the experts at the outset, and be vigilant in updating laws to match current technological realities.</p><p>  Which leads to a final point: The rules governing the internet made sense in the dot-com era. They don't anymore. Today's online world was built largely in the early 1990s, when the government opened up the internet to commercial activity and wrote rules governing its infrastructure. This included Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which said that no internet provider or platform could be considered the publisher or speaker of any information placed on its site by a third party.</p><p>  The measure came out of another intensely partisan moment. Bill Clinton was in the White House; Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House. Internet policy was close to the only thing on which the rivals could agree. This was thanks, in large part, to the persuasive power of Silicon Valley, which then was the outsider, lobbying Washington lawmakers to protect their electronic frontier from the greedy designs of large cable and telecom companies. Don't regulate us, dot-com leaders cried. Let us regulate ourselves. Lawmakers agreed.</p><p>  Before then, the American government had tightly regulated other communications media like radio, television and telephony. But Congress chose not to hold the small, still developing 1990s-era internet to the same standard. That was a wise move then. Google and Facebook didn't exist when Section 230 went into effect. Amazon's website had been up less than a year. As online platforms become more powerful than all other media, it is time for policymakers to step back in. But they should do so with care, and with history in mind.</p><p>  Silicon Valley's story isn't just one of freewheeling entrepreneurs and farsighted technologists. It's about laws and regulations that gave the men and women of the tech world remarkable freedom to define what the future might look like, to push the boundaries of what was technologically possible, and to make money in the process.</p><p>  Washington's hands-off approach ultimately permitted a marvelous explosion of content and connectivity on social media and other platforms. But the people designing the rules of the internet didn't reckon with the ways that bad actors could exploit the system. The people building those tools had little inkling of how powerful, and exploitable, their creations would become.</p><p>  The tech world likes to look forward, not backward. But reckoning with its past is essential in mapping out where it goes next.</p><p>  Margaret O'Mara (@margaretomara) is a professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of ''The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America,'' from which this essay is adapted.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Driving the Day    FIRST IN MT: MORE Q\u2019S FOR TECH CEOS \u2014 Members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee said they walked away from last month\u2019s historic tech hearing unimpressed by what they heard from the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google. Now, they\u2019re looking for more answers. In follow-up inquiries to Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, obtained or reviewed by MT, committee members are demanding additional information on everything from the companies\u2019 business dealings to their content moderation practices. Here\u2019s a breakdown:   \u2014 For Zuckerberg: Has Facebook buckled to bias complaints? Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland is asking whether the company has made any \u201cconcessions\u201d to political officials or organizations \u201cto address perceived political or ideological bias on Facebook.\u201d And he wants to know whether pressure to tackle the bias charges has affected the company\u2019s hiring. Republicans at the hearing aired allegations of an anti-GOP bias by the tech giants, which the companies flatly deny and Democrats dismiss as political theater.   \u2014 For Bezos: Can Amazon make sure its Covid-19 gear is safe and legit? Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado is pressing the Amazon chief to spell out how the company plans to \u201censure the safety\u201d of the personal protective equipment sold on its platform, writing that during the Covid-19 pandemic, \u201cprices on e-commerce platforms for these desperately needed products have skyrocketed while e-commerce platforms have failed to guarantee product safety and have failed to remove counterfeit products.\u201d Amazon has faced heightened pressure in Washington to crack down on fake goods, and particularly of medical tools, amid Covid-19.   \u2014 For Pichai: How are Google\u2019s data practices affecting publishers? Raskin voices concern that Google and other major platforms can scrape \u201ccontent from newspaper websites, host significant portions of news stories in their curated news service, and pass back none of the ad revenue they generate.\u201d And he presses for more information on whether Google profits from the data it collects off scraped material without sharing any of it with publishers. Google (and Facebook\u2019s) effect on the news industry has been a major focus of the subcommittee\u2019s tech investigation .   \u2014 For Cook: How is Apple making money off iPhone location data? Buck wants to know \u201chow frequently\u201d iPhones report user location data to the company \u201cfor advertising purposes.\u201d House Judiciary lawmakers have long voiced concern that the tech giants\u2019 vast troves of user data give them a massive competitive edge over smaller rivals.   \u2014 Other lines of inquiry: Raskin asks whether Facebook will commit to \u201cremoving Holocaust denial content\u201d on its platforms, and he has more questions about Amazon\u2019s negotiations with WarnerMedia over its HBO Max service. Buck wants more information on Google\u2019s potential dealings with the Chinese government.    DEMOCRATS AND SILICON VALLEY: WHAT A DIFFERENCE FOUR YEARS MAKE \u2014 When Hillary Clinton took the stage at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, it was a different era for the party\u2019s relationship with Silicon Valley.   \u2014 Flashback: In her primetime speech , Clinton touted a 100-day plan to pass a major investment package focused in part on jobs in \u201ctechnology and innovation.\u201d It was her sole tech mention that night in Philadelphia, where few could have foreseen the reckoning looming over the industry\u2019s handling of foreign meddling, user data and more. The party, after all, had for years cultivated a cozy relationship with industry leaders , seen as bastions of American innovation.   \u2014 Fast forward to 2020: Now, scrutiny of those same leaders and their companies has gone mainstream in the Democratic Party, with several of its top presidential contenders urging the government to break up the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies or revoke its liability protections . This week\u2019s virtual convention will feature speeches from some of the party\u2019s harshest Silicon Valley critics, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tonight, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Wednesday. Even Clinton, slated to deliver a speech Wednesday, has grown increasingly blunt in her rebukes of Facebook and its peers.   \u2014 What\u2019s changed: Democrats\u2019 once-snug relationship with Silicon Valley has fractured over mounting concerns about misinformation and harmful content, privacy abuses, treatment of tech workers and allegations of anti-competitive conduct, ushering in a wave of calls for new regulation and stricter oversight.   \u2014 What hasn\u2019t changed: Party leaders are still pushing for major government investments in key tech areas, much like Clinton in 2016. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden \u2014 who has skewered social media companies for tolerating political misinformation during the 2020 campaign \u2014 has pledged a $300 billion investment into research and development for 5G wireless technology and artificial intelligence.   \u2014  How the party platform has changed on tech: In 2016, Democrats added an antitrust plank back into the platform for the first time since 1980. Back then, the party pledged to \u201cmake competition policy and antitrust stronger\u201d by reinvigorating the FTC and DOJ. Today, their draft platform mentions neither agency, instead talking about reducing concentration in health care, agriculture and telecom \u2014 still with no word on tech. On privacy, Democrats\u2019 2016 platform focused on federal surveillance. Now in 2020, the platform calls for updating the Obama-era Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and \u201cadding strong national standards\u201d to protect against data breaches.   \u2014 Meanwhile: The Trump campaign is hoping to flood the web this week with a massive counterprogramming advertising blitz that its digital director boasts has \u201cUnheard of scale &amp; saturation.\u201d According to The New York Times , \u201cthe Trump campaign will be taking over the banner of YouTube for 96 hours starting on Tuesday, the second day of the convention, an expensive and far-reaching digital gambit.\u201d   PAI TO CONGRESS: LET FCC LEAD ON BROADBAND \u2014 Pai is offering a suggestion to lawmakers: Perhaps forget about loading the Department of Agriculture with cash to subsidize broadband buildout and supply the FCC with those funds instead?   \u2014 \u201c If the goal is to avoid overbuilding and other duplicative efforts , Congress should allocate funding solely to one agency \u2014 the FCC, which has long been primarily responsible for promoting broadband deployment in the United States,\u201d Pai told Senate Commerce Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in his written responses to the panel following a June 24 oversight hearing.   \u2014 Pai\u2019s recommendation comes as many lawmakers look to USDA as a natural place to run broadband subsidy programs, even as the FCC runs its own universal service subsidy fund of many billions of dollars. House appropriators are this year proposing to expand USDA\u2019s ReConnect broadband program , clearing legislation through the chamber to give the department hundreds of millions of dollars.   \u2014 But the Pai exchange underscores jurisdictional administration jockeying on broadband, which will be worth watching if Congress ever reaches a bigger deal on infrastructure and amid Covid-19 connectivity discussions.   TECH QUOTE DU JOUR \u2014 \u201cWhatever.\u201d That\u2019s how President Donald Trump responded on Friday when asked by reporters about the concerns voiced by other U.S. companies that his executive order against TikTok and WeChat could undermine their business interests. \u201cI've got to do what's good in terms of the security of our country,\u201d he continued. Later Friday, Trump hit TikTok parent-company ByteDance yet again , issuing an executive order that gives it 90 days to divest its U.S. operations.   \u2014 But wait, there\u2019s more: \u201cPresident Donald Trump said on Saturday he could exert pressure on more Chinese companies such as technology giant Alibaba after he moved to ban TikTok,\u201d via Reuters .   \u2014 Related reading: \u201cPresident Donald Trump has joined Triller, a rival to the video sharing app TikTok that he wants ban in the US,\u201d via The Verge .

The approach being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch. That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data \u2014 where they've been, what they view, who their friends are \u2014and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit. </p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the 'Holy Grail' for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, 'non-progressive' federal statute.Senior executives from AT...Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate 'inconsistent' state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing. Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be 'high enough in the federal legislation' to provide meaningful consumer protections. The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that 'will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.'President Donald Trump signed a bill in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT...Comcast and Verizon share that information. Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire 'life cycle' of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the 'possible unintended consequences' of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data. The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.'A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,' the Internet Association said in a recent statement. The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. 'A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.' The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.The goal is a policy 'that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,' White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. 'We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.'

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p>However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>President Donald Trump signed a bill in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement. The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-270637dec20111e8b8eb9da28705dc06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TD3-X8Y1-JBKM-D0M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a bill that would force transparency on companies that trade in user data. The bill, known as the Dashboard Act (Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broader Oversight and Regulations on Data), would affect tech platforms with more than 100 million monthly users, defining these companies as \u201ccommercial data operators.\u201d Companies over that monthly user threshold would be required to tell users once every 90 days what types of data they collect as well as disclose that data\u2019s monetary value.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those companies would also be required to report the total value of user data collected on an annual basis, including disclosures around third-party relationships. As part of the disclosure, tech platforms would be forced to provide the opportunity for users to delete all of parts of their data, \u201cincluding any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.\u201d Companies that refuse to comply would face penalties from the FTC.</p><p>\u201cFor years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that\u2019s not true\u2014you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\u201d Warner said.</p><p>\u201cThese \u2018free\u2019 products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,\u201d Sen. Hawley echoed in a press release. \u201cEven worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\u201d</p><p>Warner and Hawley contend that the bill would help the Securities and Exchange Commission craft methods for assessing the value of user data on tech platforms across varying business models.</p><p>For its part, big tech seemed cool on the idea of these specific disclosures, though not altogether uncooperative\u2014yet.</p><p>On Monday, the Internet Association, the lobbying group representing most of the platforms targeted by such legislation, said that it was \"encouraged\" by lawmaker interest in consumer privacy, though would clearly prefer those regulations to be broader rather than laser focused on big tech.</p><p>\u201cThe internet industry supports a comprehensive, economy-wide federal privacy law that covers all companies\u2014from social media sites to local grocery stores to data brokers\u2014to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies,\u201d Internet Association President Michael Beckerman said in a statement on the bill.</p><p>Facebook echoed that cooperative sentiment, though it declined to supply details about how and if the social giant could cooperate with the proposal. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our ongoing conversations with the bill\u2019s sponsors,\u201d Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said of the legislation. Amazon and Google did not respond to The Daily Beast's request for comment.</p><p>As far as threats on the horizon go, the Dashboard Act is pretty tame. Last week, Hawley introduced a very different bill to wield against big tech, though one with a far less coherent solution for tempering the industry\u2019s power. That bill, dubbed the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, seeks to sever internet companies from a critical legal provision known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. If Hawley\u2019s new bipartisan legislation with Warner is a fairly common-sense step down the center, his own bill would unravel the internet as we know it\u2014throwing the baby out with big tech\u2019s bath water and then some.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2245950824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDT-HSP1-DY0W-43P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">The chief executives of the four US tech giants - Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet's Google and Apple - whose companies are worth a combined $5.5trillion, will testify before Congress in late July as part of an ongoing antitrust probe into the companies, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Apple's Tim Cook will appear as part of an antitrust probe being done by the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, the sources said.</p><p>The companies did not immediately comment when asked to respond by DailyMail.com.</p><p>The four men, whose personal net worth is estimated to be a combined $240billion, will appear together before lawmakers for the first time ever in what is expected to be a highly anticipated event.</p><p>The CEOs' joint appearance is a result of painstaking, months-long negotiations between the House of Representatives and the tech giants who at first refused to allow their executives to be grilled by lawmakers individually.</p><p>The House antitrust panel led by House Rep David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, threatened to subpoena Bezos, the world's richest man whose personal fortune is estimated by Forbes to be worth $166.3billion.</p><p>Zuckerberg is the seventh richest man in the world with a net worth of $85.4billion, according to Forbes.</p><p>Cook's personal net worth is estimated at $625million, which Pichai's fortune is pegged at around $600million. </p><p>Amazon representatives told the House panel that it would be willing to make another executive available to testify, though it would not commit to having Bezos do so, according to Politico. </p><p>Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Pichai said they would agree to appear before Congress to answer questions about their companies' competitive practices, though only on condition that they would appear together at the same time.</p><p>Cook, the CEO of Apple, initially declined to make the same pledge, but ultimately relented, according to Politico. </p><p>Cook and Bezos were at one point so reluctant to testify that the House panel threatened to force them by way of subpoena, it has been reported. </p><p>According to the reported understanding between the executives and lawmakers, if one of the four backs out, the others will do so as well. </p><p>As of Thursday morning, the last remaining tech giant that has drawn federal scrutiny for alleged antitrust practices, Microsoft, is not scheduled to be represented at the hearing.</p><p>DailyMail.com has reached out to Microsoft for comment. </p><p>In February, the federal government said it was ramping up its year-long investigation of the five dominant tech companies, who were asked to provide information on their acquisitions dating back to 2010.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel have been investigating the conduct of big tech companies and whether they aggressively bought potential rivals to suppress competition and hurt consumers. </p><p>Some critics have pointed to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, for example, as deals that should be questioned.</p><p>The popular messaging services are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has enabled it to snuff out competition.</p><p>The regulators' action could fuel expectations that as a result of the investigations, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier acquisitions and divest companies.</p><p>'This initiative will enable the (FTC) to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector, and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition,' FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said in a statement.</p><p>The agency is asking the companies for information and documents on the terms, scope, structure and purpose of acquisitions made between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019.</p><p>Google faced antitrust scrutiny more than a decade ago over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a competitor in digital advertising.</p><p>Apart from the government and congressional investigations, state attorneys general from both political parties are conducting antitrust probes of Google and Facebook. </p><p>In the Google investigation, the attorneys general have asked the company for internal documents related to how it sells ads and tracks the behavior of people who use its search engine and other products.</p><p>Spokespeople for the companies couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Cicilline, who is leading the panel's probe, has said that Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the big tech companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. </p><p>He has suggested that legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>'It is far too common to hear horror stories from startups and other small businesses about how a dominant platform's abrupt changes have destroyed their business,' Cicilline said at a January hearing at which executives from small and medium-sized tech companies testified. </p><p>The executives of four small and medium-sized tech companies urged Congress to curb what they call the monopolistic power of the four giant firms in the industry. </p><p>Sonos CEO Patrick Spence, PopSockets CEO David Barnett, Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson and Tile General Counsel Kirsten Daru took the stand and told Democratic and Republican lawmakers about their struggles to gain a foothold in a marketplace dominated by the giant firms. </p><p>Big Tech firms often co-opt ideas for new products first developed by the smaller companies and then use their dominant position in the marketplace to undercut their competitors on price, the executives told lawmakers in January.</p><p>In April 2019, Tile.com, which helps users find lost or misplaced items, suddenly found itself competing with Apple Inc, after years of enjoying a mutually beneficial relationship with the iPhone maker.</p><p>Apple carried Tile on its app store and had sold its products at its stores since 2015.</p><p>It had even showcased Tile's technology at a big event in 2018. </p><p>The startup had sent an engineer to Apple's headquarters to develop a feature with the company's voice assistant, Siri.</p><p>Then, in early 2019, Tile's executives read news reports of Apple launching a hardware product, along with a service that resembled what Tile sold. </p><p>In June, Apple stopped selling Tile's products in its stores and has since hired its engineer.</p><p>The smaller companies are seeking to urge Congress to look at how big tech use their considerable clout to hurt rivals.</p><p>'After thoughtful consideration and months of bringing our concerns to Apple through regular... channels, Tile has made the decision to continue raising concerns over Apple's anti-competitive practices,' Tile's general counsel Kirsten Daru told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing.</p><p>An Apple spokesman said the company has not built a business model around knowing a customer's location or the location of their device.</p><p>PopSockets, a seller of collapsible phone grips, testified against Amazon. </p><p>The company's chief executive, Barnett, said the firm started as a seller on Amazon's third-party marketplace and then sold items directly to Amazon as a vendor, but decided to end its relationship with the company after two years in 2018.</p><p>Barnett said Amazon required PopSockets to pay almost $2 million in marketing so it could market its products as originals in the face of a wave of counterfeits. </p><p>The online retailer 'frequently lowered their selling price of our product and then expected and needed us to help pay for the lost margin,' he said.</p><p>'On multiple occasions we found that Amazon Retail was itself sourcing counterfeit PopGrips and selling them alongside our authentic products,' he told lawmakers.</p><p>Amazon spokesman Jack Evans said PopSockets was free to choose which retailers it supplies and could choose to stop selling via Amazon. </p><p>Third party sellers continue to sell the product on the platform. </p><p>'We've continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit,' Evans said.</p><p>Basecamp, which sells an online project management tool, complained about Google allowing competitors to bid to have their own ads run when its trademarked name was typed into the search engine.</p><p>It said the practice allowed competitors to purchase ads that made it hard for consumers to reach Basecamp's website, co-founder Hansson told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing. </p><p>The company has opened multiple trademark infringement investigations with Google but the process is 'onerous and slow,' he said.</p><p>'Google's monopoly on internet search must be broken up for the sake of a fair marketplace,' Hansson said. </p><p>Basecamp is now forced to run a more than $70,000 annual advertising campaign to counteract the effect, he said.</p><p>Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said for trademarked terms like names of a business, the company's policy balances the interest of both users and advertisers.</p><p>Google allows competitors to bid on trademarked terms because that offers users more choice when they are searching, but if a trademark owner files a complaint, Google blocks competitors from using their actual name in the text of the advertisement, Castaneda said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The chief executives of four of the most prominent technology firms in the world \u2013 Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook \u2013 are expected to answer questions about their business practices and market dominance. Though their businesses represent new-age innovations, including search engines, smartphones and social media, the criticisms they face bring to mind those lodged by \"trustbusters\" against late 19th-century industrial barons.      Since last June, the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust issues has been investigating \"the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\" as a joint statement from committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., put it. The panel is one of several fronts on which the tech industry is battling against the prospect of government regulations.      Critics of the technology giants welcomed the scrutiny in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. The hearing \"comes on the heels of a yearlong investigation that is looking deeply into the market power and the business models and the conduct of these four corporations,\" said Sarah Miller, co-chair of the advocacy group Freedom From Facebook &amp; Google. \"And that is something that has not really been done in decades.\"      The subcommittee members could go beyond the topic of antitrust regulation and digital monopolies. The four companies are implicated in a host of other issues \u2013 including labor practices, domestic surveillance and online censorship \u2013 some of which have become increasingly contentious in an election year that has had both parties taking shots at Big Tech.      When Zuckerberg testified before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees in 2018, for instance, the discussion touched not only on data privacy \u2013 the focus of the hearing \u2013 but also on disinformation, political bias and even the basics of Facebook's business model.     The scope of the House hearing could easily expand because the four CEOs lead radically different companies. With all four being questioned at once \u2013 and remotely \u2013 some have worried that the committee members won't be able to question the witnesses as aggressively or in as much depth as they otherwise might.      \"The weirdness of the hearing is that we'll have all these four CEOs together,\" Fordham Law School associate professor Zephyr Teachout said on the press call. \"I think of the great 1950s hearings into the mob ... having the heads of four families all lined up together on a livestream, all answering questions at the same time.\"      All four companies face complaints of monopolistic behavior, though the practices in dispute vary greatly.      Facebook is criticized for its acquisitions of other social media and messaging firms, expanding laterally with strategic purchases of platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Giphy. It's also drawn fire for practices viewed as unfairly targeting competing platforms, such as copying core features of photo-messaging app Snapchat or preventing users of a short-lived video app, Vine, from using Facebook data to find their friends.      Google and Amazon are under scrutiny for their roles in specific online marketplaces \u2013 Google with its various digital advertising services and Amazon with its massive shopping platform, where it also sells its own goods in competition with third-party retailers.     The swipes at Apple are more narrow, concerning the company's dual role in both selling hardware such as iPhones and operating the marketplace for software for the devices. In May 2019, the Supreme Court cleared the way for lawsuits against Apple for compelling its users to buy apps through its App Store, and taking a 30% commission in the process.      \"U.S. antitrust authorities need to consider whether these or other digital service companies are protected by barriers constructed by anti-competitive behavior, and take appropriate remedial action where required,\" wrote Marc Jarsulic, chief economist at the liberal Center for American Progress.      Notably absent from the proceedings will be Microsoft. The company and CEO Satya Nadella have escaped some of the \"techlash\" of recent years. However, the messaging platform Slack recently filed an antitrust complaint in Europe over Microsoft's competing platform Teams, and hasn't ruled out pursuing action in the United States.      Europe has aggressively regulated tech platforms. The European Union launched antitrust investigations into Apple's Apple Pay platform and App Store in June, has also targeted Amazon and Facebook, and hit Google with a $2.6-billion antitrust fine.      As concern has grown among Democrats and Republicans about the power and scale of the tech giants, the House Judiciary Committee has not been the only governmental body hinting at aggressive regulations of the industries.      Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission issued orders to all four companies as well as Microsoft for information on their acquisitions of start-ups between 2010 and 2019, suggesting concern that the tech giants bought up potential competitors early to keep the playing field clear.      Last summer the Department of Justice began another antitrust investigation, citing widespread concerns about reduced competition and innovation in the online \"search, social media, and some retail services\" sectors. And state attorneys general across the country also have opened joint investigations into potentially monopolistic behavior at Google and</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42713131921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFW1-F07F-84NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Miami Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC00023S9</classCode><className>MILLER CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Zuckerberg, who has testified repeatedly before Congress along with his competitors, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on March 30 that the U.S. should consider tightening Internet rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability.\u201cWe need a more active role for governments and regulators,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cBy updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what\u2019s best about it \u2014 the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things \u2014 while also protecting society from broader harms.\u201dHis opinion drew mixed reactions from policymakers. Some analysts and Democratic lawmakers have suggested previously that Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors want a federal privacy rule merely to undercut strict new policies in states like California.The Facebook CEO \u201cdoesn\u2019t get to make the rules anymore,\u201d warned Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. \u201cFacebook is under criminal and civil investigation. It has shown it cannot regulate itself,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDoes anyone even want his advice?\u201dOthers took a softer approach. \u201cZuckerberg is right,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., posted on Twitter. \u201cTech companies must be accountable for safeguarding against violent extremists and foreign adversaries. There must be strict legal limits on how platforms use our data. It\u2019s time for Congress to set clear and common-sense rules.\u201dSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a leading critic of tech companies, urged the social media giant to work alongside Congress on a legislative solution. The industry needs \"effective legislative guardrails,\" he said, and \"the largest platforms, like Facebook, are going to need to be subject to a higher level of regulation in keeping with their enormous power.\"But when it comes to controlling content, a crucial topic for a company that struggled to keep up with viral reposts of a video from a mass shooting in New Zealand in March, Facebook may still have to make many decisions on its own. As a business, it has constitutional latitude that Congress lacks.\u201cOutsourcing censorship to the government is not just a bad idea, it would violate the First Amendment,\" said Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican.Betsy Page Sigman, a Georgetown University professor who studies social media, said Zuckerberg\u2019s proposal raises more questions than answers.\u201cIn general, it\u2019s hard for social media executives and social media so-called experts to even keep up with and have a wide understanding of this constantly morphing force in this country that\u2019s called social media,\" she said. \"I\u2019m wondering how on earth government is going to, first, get an understanding of it and, second, devise a way to control it.\"Zuckerberg\u2019s embrace of government oversight could be a maneuver to protect his company\u2019s interests, particularly as the future of Silicon Valley\u2019s titans is also being thrust into the 2020 presidential campaign. In a blog post last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for a breakup of Internet titans and lamented their outsize power.\u201cThere have been numerous public concerns about social media, and so the company could not do nothing,\u201d said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey had to call for some action. They probably are hoping it\u2019s going to take a while for the regulators to agree on what to do.\u201dBipartisan criticism of Facebook and other big tech companies reached a fever pitch after the 2016 presidential election, when intelligence agencies said the Russian government exploited platforms to sway voters. The company also came under fire after the disclosure that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that worked with the Trump campaign, improperly harvested personal data from 50 million Facebook users. West said Zuckerberg is likely hoping for light-touch regulation, but acknowledged reaching consensus in Congress would not be an easy task.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult generating a majority, because you have different businesses that make money in very different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have lots of differences across sectors in terms of how tech plays out, so it won\u2019t be easy to actually pass legislation.\u201dSigman urged government stakeholders to proceed with caution in the wake of Zuckerberg\u2019s call.\u201cHe was being a natural CEO who wants to defend his company and grow it \u2014 that\u2019s what a CEO naturally wants to do,\" she said. \"Government should be very careful when they come up with regulation for the Internet.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2205406076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW0-RP81-JBHT-D0NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

There's so much going on \u2014 so much you need to know \u2014 that it's hard to keep up. After weeks of the same ol', same ol', 2020 dumped a veritable ton of information all in one day. And we're not just talking the 272 companies reporting earnings today. </p><p>No sir! First up, we've got a monetary policy statement from the Federal Reserve. Good ol' Jerome Powell is expected to flex his muscle as chairman and hold the line. Powell promised to do whatever it takes to fix the economy[1] and keep the market stable. So far, Jerome's 'unlimited stimulus' is working for the market. But as for the average Joe that remains to be seen. I didn't expect anything new from today's Fed statement, and I wasn't disappointed. Next, we have the Big Tech antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill. CEOs from the four biggest tech companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 were grilled by the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee today. Congress reportedly has more than one million documents related to its antitrust investigation, and it wants answers. I imagine the exchange going something like this: Congress: Big Tech, did you create a monopoly? Big Tech: You want answers? Congress: I think we're entitled to them. Big Tech: You want answers?! Congress: We want the truth! Big Tech: You can't handle the truth! Congress, we live in a world ripe with technology and profit, and that profit has to be guarded by companies with gigabytes of personal data. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Rep. Cicilline? We have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.  You weep for 'Freedom of speech' and data privacy and you curse Big Tech. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know \u2014 that data privacy's death, while tragic, probably saved profits.  And our existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves profits. It clearly wasn't that dramatic I don't think. But one can dream Big Tech's real approach centered on pushing how satisfied its customers are[2], and how many jobs it provides for the U.S. economy. Fair points, but when Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN[3]) CEO Jeff Bezos whipped out internal poll numbers for Amazon's brand, I was inclined to call bull$#%&amp;#38; (Bless me, sorry about that. I don't know what came over me.) In the end, Congress will do very little. It simply can't act right now. The House and the Senate are divided along party lines. The investing angle here is clear. More of the same for Big Tech. Continued gains interrupted by bouts of heavy volatility. Congress will threaten to act, leading to rapid price swings, but it won't amount to much for the time being. All I know is that, to me, you look like you're having fun. Open up your portfolio arms, watch out here volatility comes. Now, if you're tired of being spun right round (baby), right round like a record (baby), Great Stuff has your Dramamine right here If you want to move in just a little bit closer, take every bit of profit out of both sides of the volatility pendulum, set your sights on One Trade \u2014 nothing else will do. One Trade is the peak form of simple, volatility-beating strategies, letting you spin round (right round) and adjust your bullishness or bearishness on a dime. All that greatness with just One Trade on one ticker once a week. No frills, no fuss, no mess, no more tears. Click here for the One Trade you need.[4] Good: Go Online, Young Man! And you thought the dot-com era was the internet's big 'gold rush?' Pshaw. It's nothing compared to the e-commerce rush right now. Practically every mom-and-pop operation is moving to online sales during the pandemic. And Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP[5]) shows them how it's done. The online e-commerce enabler just posted quarterly earnings[6] of $0.29 per share, blowing past last year's loss and Wall Street's estimates. Revenue soared 97% to $714.3 million, and gross merchandise volume more than doubled to $30.1 billion. What's more, Shopify believes that this is just the start of a permanent retail shift toward online platforms. The only hitch in Shopify's giddyap is the 'magnitude and duration' of COVID-19. As such, the company joined hundreds of others in not providing current-quarter or full-year guidance. If you've watched SHOP along with Great Stuff, you know the company is being conservative here. However, real investors don't chase rallies. Wait for a dip in SHOP or a round of profit-taking before taking the leap.Better: Micro Is the New Macro Oh, how the turn tables. With Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC[7]) struggling cash in its chips, there's a new king in the semiconductor market: Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD[8]). The crown was handed over by default with Intel unable to match AMD in making next-generation seven-nanometer chips. But after last night's quarterly report, AMD earned its position. AMD beat the consensus estimates for both earnings and revenue in the second quarter. The company also lifted its outlook for the third quarter and the full year. All this at a time when many companies are afraid to give any hint at all on future performance. Third-quarter sales are expected to arrive between $2.45 billion and $2.65 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimate for $2.31 billion. Full-year guidance was lifted to $8.88 billion \u2014 up 32% year over year and above analyst expectations for $8.4 billion. Now, regular readers know that I'm not one to chase a rally \u2014 I mean, I just told you that in the last section! But AMD has amazing potential. Use your own judgment, do your due diligence and find a price point that works for you. You won't regret it. Finally, investors in Great Stuff Picks sit on a gain of more than 160% with AMD right now! Congratulations! You see, this is why you need to read Great Stuff every day. You never know what opportunity (or really bad pun) you'll miss. For now, Great Stuff recommends that you continue to hold AMD. With next-generation game consoles releasing this holiday season, and AMD's Epyc server chips gobbling up market share in the same data center space that Intel's eyeing down. There are more gains to be had here.Best: Gotta Photograph, Picture of Look at this photograph, every time I do it makes me laugh. Remember when Kodak was red? And what the hell has gone to investors' heads? Why? Why did you tease me with Def Leppard and then give me Nickleback? Evil! You're evil! Well I thought the stark contrast between the two would adequately convey the utter insanity of Eastman Kodak Co.'s (NYSE: KODK[9]) 1,260% rally just this week! Seriously. KODK closed at $2.62 on Monday. Today, it trades north of $34. Did traders go insane? Kodak hasn't made film in nearly a decade. It actually went bankrupt in 2012. What gives? President Trump (Ah say no more! That explains it.) announced on Tuesday that Kodak would produce generic drug ingredients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Defense Production Act, Trump authorized a $765 million loan[10] to Kodak. For a bit of perspective, $765 million was roughly 5.6 times Kodak's entire $115 million market cap at Tuesday's open. Holy cats now that's a loan! As per the Food and Drug Administration, Kodak will begin producing crucial pharmaceutical ingredients facing chronic shortage. 'Kodak is proud to be a part of strengthening America's self sufficiency in producing the key pharmaceutical ingredients we need to keep our citizens safe,' said Kodak Executive Chairman Jim Continenza. Let's just hope that Kodak is as good at making drug components as it was with film before the digital revolution. If so, then there may be some substance behind the stock's recent rally. I mean, aside from quintupling KODK's market cap in two days, that is. I'm tempted to recommend shorting KODK at this point \u2014 irrational exuberance and all. But rationality is a losing game in this market, and Kodak has a real chance to use this cash to return to some semblance of its former greatness.If you've stuck with 'Stuff for any length of time, you'll know we've kept a close eye on Big Tech's continued run-ins with the antitrust fun-busters. (See also: FAANG vs. the World[11].) I mean, by this point, Congress should just enlist these same Big Tech CEOs as counsels to help the less-tech-inclined regulators cover the antitrust beat \u2014 who else knows the ins and outs of building monopolies than Bezos and the boys? You know it's that whole 'make an insider trader help the SEC clean up insider trading' Joseph Kennedy method. That has clearly worked out well right? Anyway, in our Poll of the Week, we're bringing it back around to Big Tech (and its CEOs) \u2014 or, as The New York Times elegantly describes them: 'the captains of the New Gilded Age.' That's right it's time to pin the tail on the monopoly! We've got all the best in Big Tech in the game, who will it be?

What happens next? <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">R.S.V.P. here</url> to find out at 11 a.m. Eastern. (Want this delievered to your inbox each day? <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">Sign up here</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u2018Emperors of the online economy\u2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more than five hours yesterday, U.S. lawmakers grilled Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg over <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">the power that their companies command</url> and the potential for abusing that power. Talk about <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">Zoom fatigue</url>. (Or, technically, Cisco Webex fatigue.)</p><p>The chairman of the antitrust subcommittee set the tone early. Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, called Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google \u201cemperors of the online economy\u201d that \u201cenjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors.\u201d</p><p> These moments stood out to us:</p><p> Jeff Bezos of Amazon faced questions about his company\u2019s relationships with third-party sellers. When Representative Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat who represents Amazon\u2019s district in Washington, asked him whether the company misused sales data to develop products that competes with those merchants, a rattled Mr. Bezos said, \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no.\u201d</p><p> Tim Cook of Apple was confronted over his company\u2019s iron-fisted control of its App Store and whether its demands of other developers were unfair. When Representative Jerry Nadler of New York asked whether Apple\u2019s pressing Airbnb and ClassPass for additional commissions for sales made through their apps <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">constituted \u201cpandemic profiteering,\u201d</url> Mr. Cook said the tech giant would \u201cnever\u201d do that \u2014 but said some such cases would require additional payouts to Apple.</p><p> Sundar Pichai of Google confronted several questions about his company\u2019s dominance in advertising. The hearing began when Mr. Cicilline said documents showed the tech giant sought to create \u201ca walled garden that increasingly keeps users within its sites.\u201d Mr. Pichai responded, \u201cI\u2019m really focused on giving users what they want.\u201d</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook was presented with <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">awkward emails that he sent in 2012</url> to Facebook\u2019s C.F.O. about acquiring smaller competitors, including Instagram. \u201cOne way of looking at this is that what we\u2019re really buying is time,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Less than an hour after sending that email, the Facebook founder sent another noting that, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that we\u2019d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\u201d Mr. Nadler pressed him hard on this.</p><p>How they rated. The C.E.O.s appeared virtually, beamed into the hearing room where socially-distanced, masked lawmakers sat on a wood-paneled stage. The Times\u2019s Mike Isaac gave Mr. Bezos <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">the best marks</url> for the quality of his setup: \u201c8/10 for the cool Pacific Northwest dad office vibes. Two points subtracted for his connectivity issues.\u201d The Times\u2019s fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">rated their attire</url>, noting that they \u201clooked more like four guys dressed up in their first graduation suits \u2014 serious, sincere, a little uncomfortable \u2014 than the four horsemen of the digital apocalypse whose planetary power was a threat to one and all.\u201d</p><p>By the numbers. Mr. Cook drew fewer questions from lawmakers than the others, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">as compiled</url> by The Times\u2019s Kellen Browning. But Apple\u2019s chief stood out for the number of times he shifted attention to competitors, or to China, arguing that their market power was more pressing: He employed this tactic 13 times during the hearing, twice as often as Mr. Zuckerberg, according to Kellen\u2019s calculations.</p><p>What the C.E.O.s didn\u2019t say. The website Protocol listed <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">all the questions</url> that the executives responded to with some variation of \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that.\u201d Kellen notes that Mr. Pichai did this the most, 13 times, versus seven times for Mr. Zuckerberg and three each for Mr. Bezos and Mr. Cook.</p><p> Today, the executives will be on safer ground, as all four report quarterly earnings after the market closes. Will they stick to discussing income statements and balance sheets, or will they push back on what was said during yesterday\u2019s proceedings?</p><p>Here\u2019s what is happening</p><p>Pandemic unemployment benefits are set to expire on Friday. The extra $600 a week that many jobless workers in the U.S. <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">have relied upon</url> are likely to vanish after <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">President Trump undercut</url> Senate Republicans\u2019 effort to negotiate a coronavirus aid package with Democrats.</p><p>TikTok\u2019s C.E.O. tried to reduce the political heat. Kevin Mayer, the video app\u2019s American chief, offered to <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">open up some of its core algorithms</url> to address concerns about its treatment of user data and ownership by a Chinese tech giant. Republican lawmakers say a separate plan for TikTok to sell a majority stake to Western investors <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">wouldn\u2019t allay their concerns</url>.</p><p>Big European corporates reported earnings. It was a mixed bag: Airbus reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">a big loss</url> for the first half and vowed to conserve cash; AstraZeneca reported a <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">26 percent rise in earnings</url> for its first half as sales of new drugs beat forecasts; Credit Suisse<url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">beat expectations</url>, thanks to a surge in trading revenue; trading also aided Shell, which reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">a smaller-than-expected loss</url>, and Total, which disclosed a surprise profit; and Nestl\u00e9 announced an <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">18 percent rise in first-half profit</url> but warned of slowing growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>Qualcomm struck a patent deal with Huawei. The U.S. chip maker announced that it had <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">settled a long-running licensing dispute</url> at a time when the Trump administration has cracked down on the Chinese tech giant. Shares in Qualcomm jumped 12 percent on the news.</p><p>Ashley Judd can sue Harvey Weinstein for sexual harassment. A panel of judges <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling</url> that the actress could not sue Mr. Weinstein for sexual harassment under California law because Ms. Judd and the movie producer did not have a specific business relationship at the time that she said the misconduct took place.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be bad</p><p>The Commerce Department will today publish a preliminary estimate of U.S. economic output for the second quarter. It\u2019s expected to be the worst result since quarterly G.D.P. statistics were first compiled more than 70 years ago.</p><p>How bad? The headline number is expected to show that G.D.P. fell 35 percent in the second quarter. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the economy shrank by more than a third in just three months, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">The Times\u2019s Ben Casselman explains</url>. The U.S. reports these statistics using annualized rates, which amplify short-term changes. In fact, G.D.P. is expected to be about 10 percent smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first. (That would be about the same as Germany, which reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">a 10.1 percent decline</url> in its G.D.P. this morning.) Still terrible, but not quite as eye-popping.</p><p>\u201cThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.\u201d Underscoring the economy\u2019s fragility, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">the Fed chairman Jay Powell noted</url> at a news conference yesterday that containing the coronavirus was the \u201cfundamental\u201d factor that would determine the path of growth in the future. That path is \u201cextraordinarily uncertain,\u201d he said, adding that a rebound in the labor market was \u201cgoing to take a while.\u201d In the meantime, the central bank is \u201cnot even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates.\u201d (Compared with his last news conference, that\u2019s an extra \u201cthinking about.\u201d)</p><p>The not-so painful C.E.O. pay cuts</p><p>As the pandemic hit, prompting waves of furloughs and layoffs, many corporate leaders showed solidarity by cutting their pay. As it turns out, it often wasn\u2019t much of a sacrifice.</p><p>Two-thirds of C.E.O.s who reduced their pay took only a 10 percent hit at most, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">The Times\u2019s Peter Eavis reports</url>, citing a study by the research firm CGLytics. The reductions typically hit executives\u2019 salaries, which form only a small part of their total pay. (Stock awards and bonuses are usually much bigger parts of their pay packages.)</p><p>Here\u2019s how some C.E.O.s fared, compared with what they earned in 2019:</p><p> Ed Bastian of Delta Air Lines took a 5.35 percent cut.</p><p> Oscar Munoz of United Airlines took a 3 percent cut.</p><p> Bob Iger of Walt Disney took a 3.3 percent cut.</p><p> Arne Sorenson of Marriott took a cut of less than 2 percent.</p><p> Glenn Kelman of the real estate brokerage Redfin took a $284,000 cut, worth 100 percent of his 2019 pay.</p><p>What\u2019s up with Kodak?</p><p>Its stock price, for starters. Shares in the erstwhile photography pioneer soared in recent days as it <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">won a federal loan</url> to produce ingredients for coronavirus treatments. But the timing of the trading has aroused suspicion.</p><p>Kodak\u2019s stock jumped more than 15 times higher this week, representing a potential second act for a company that has struggled to find a new direction. Momentum begets momentum, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Kodak shares have become <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">a favorite of speculative day traders</url> on the Robinhood app, where nearly 79,000 users added the stock to their portfolios in just 24 hours.</p><p>Some have cried foul, pointing to heavy trading volumes ahead of Kodak\u2019s official announcement about the government loan. The Wall Street Journal reports that there is an explanation: Kodak<url normalizedValue=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/dealbookdebrief0730/newsletter\">had briefed news outlets</url> in its hometown, Rochester, N.Y. \u2014 but neglected to say that the information was not for public reporting at the time.

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House Antitrust, Commercial &amp; Administrative Law Subcommittee, said on Fox News Sunday.</p><p>Cicillines committee is set to hold its first hearing on the dominance of Big Tech on June 11, part of a wider probe of the industry that the lawmaker said may lead to legislation. The goal, he said, is to bring more competition to the space.</p><p>The companies provide platforms for consumers and gather information that is then used by advertising companies, political parties and other groups. Its become controversial, particularly after private information from Facebook was mined by a British political consultancy tied to Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>The data thats collected is used to generate revenue, so theyre not really free, Cicilline said.</p><p>Consumer advocates and a newspaper trade group are scheduled to testify on the effect of digital platforms on news media organizations, possible anti-competitive conduct of dominant firms, and whether current laws and enforcement policies are adequate, a person familiar with the hearing has said.</p><p>The U.S. government is ramping up its antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech on several fronts. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission recently signaled that formal investigations may be forthcoming by divvying up antitrust oversight for Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>Cicilline has also said recently that concentration in the digital markets industry has resulted in anti-competitive behavior, breaches of privacy and consumers losing control of their own data. The antitrust subcommittee will seek company records and gather testimony from corporate officials through depositions and hearings, Cicilline told Bloomberg Television in an interview last week.</p><p>In the past few years, there have been calls from some lawmakers to at least rein in, if not break up, technology companies that are seen by some as having become too big and powerful in many ways. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made perhaps the most detailed case for breaking up and regulating the four companies, but the Massachusetts Democrat, a 2020 presidential hopeful, isnt alone in her aggressive views on the industry.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/14/report-trump-still-owes-d-c-7-million-for-inauguration/\">        Report: Trump still owes D.C. $7 million for inauguration     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/13/rep-hunters-wife-pleads-guilty-to-corruption-charge/\">California GOP Rep.

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House Antitrust, Commercial &amp; Administrative Law Subcommittee, said on Fox News Sunday.</p><p>Cicillines committee is set to hold its first hearing on the dominance of Big Tech on June 11, part of a wider probe of the industry that the lawmaker said may lead to legislation. The goal, he said, is to bring more competition to the space.</p><p>The companies provide platforms for consumers and gather information that is then used by advertising companies, political parties and other groups. Its become controversial, particularly after private information from Facebook was mined by a British political consultancy tied to Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>The data thats collected is used to generate revenue, so theyre not really free, Cicilline said.</p><p>Consumer advocates and a newspaper trade group are scheduled to testify on the effect of digital platforms on news media organizations, possible anti-competitive conduct of dominant firms, and whether current laws and enforcement policies are adequate, a person familiar with the hearing has said.</p><p>The U.S. government is ramping up its antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech on several fronts. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission recently signaled that formal investigations may be forthcoming by divvying up antitrust oversight for Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>Cicilline has also said recently that concentration in the digital markets industry has resulted in anti-competitive behavior, breaches of privacy and consumers losing control of their own data. The antitrust subcommittee will seek company records and gather testimony from corporate officials through depositions and hearings, Cicilline told Bloomberg Television in an interview last week.</p><p>In the past few years, there have been calls from some lawmakers to at least rein in, if not break up, technology companies that are seen by some as having become too big and powerful in many ways. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made perhaps the most detailed case for breaking up and regulating the four companies, but the Massachusetts Democrat, a 2020 presidential hopeful, isnt alone in her aggressive views on the industry.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/14/report-trump-still-owes-d-c-7-million-for-inauguration/\">        Report: Trump still owes D.C. $7 million for inauguration     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/14/h-1b-visa-congressman-seeks-to-kill-opt-work-permit-for-foreign-students/\">        H-1B visa: Congressman seeks to kill OPT work permit for foreign students     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/13/rep-hunters-wife-pleads-guilty-to-corruption-charge/\">California GOP Rep.

Enjoy the flexibility of a schedule built for working professionals. Learn More.      Like a lot of you, last week I watched the congressional testimony from the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google -- and there were a lot of apparent things that were problematic.    One is that there are folks in Congress that likely shouldn't be in Congress (and if you watched the testimony you know who I'm talking about), and another is that each company has some serious issues they haven't dealt with. Though, I think Apple seemed to get through this pretty cleanly.  However, at the same time, Arizona stepped up and took a decent shot at Apple regarding throttling older iPhones -- and that tended to drop Apple into the same mess as everyone else.    Given the remedy that seemed to be favored is breaking up the companies, which I think is akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face, I'm going to suggest a different path.    We'll close with my product of the week -- an instrumental Microsoft 365 third-party app that could free up more of your time to binge watch videos.   Power Corrupts   If you were to step back from the grilling, a common theme was an abuse of power.  This position was highlighted differently in each of the companies:    Amazon -- for aggressively abusing their selling partners, highlighting stories consistent with what I have also heard;  Apple -- for abusing their app store vendors and allegedly using slave labor to build their devices;  Google -- for taking the majority of ad revenue, putting the U.S. press at severe risk of failure, and for allegedly not complying even with their internal privacy directives; and  Facebook -- for buying up all of their competition and assuring none could emerge.    It did seem like, with some noted and embarrassing exceptions, that the men and women empaneled were laser focused on these firms abusing U.S. citizens, and the firms did not present themselves well.    Example after example of abuse of power was brought forward from the year-long congressional investigation into the firms' practices; and the evidence was pretty damning, as a strong case was being built for abuse of monopoly power that could be applied to all four companies.    But, like a lot of things out of government, the suggested remedy to break up the firms is overly tactical and likely will do the nation more harm than good.   Breaking Up Isn't Just Hard - It's Dangerous   I've studied government responses to antitrust problems over the years, and generally, they do a different kind of damage.    For instance, the breakup of Standard Oil removed the U.S. as a leader in the petrochemical industry and replaced it with the oil cartels (mostly Arabian).    The breakup of RCA took consumer electronics and gave the industry to Japan.  The consent decree with IBM critically weakened the company. It did eventually lead to the rise of Apple, Intel, and Microsoft, but it was a very close thing as Japan and England were clearly in the hunt for that industry.    Microsoft was able to recover from their consent decree as well, suggesting that this, if it is enforced, can be a better way to deal with the problem and not pass the industry on to another country. But the decree has to be enforced, and the typical use of internal audit for this has proven problematic because that function, in most companies, has either declined or never been powerful enough in the first place.    Regardless of the approach, the effort has to go beyond the initial remedy and assure the intended outcome.  You can't just kill a U.S. company and assume that other U.S. companies will benefit.  We are in a world market, and other countries will step up and fund the emergence of competitors who will then take away the crippled company's business and power.    So you not only have to restrict the misbehaving company but also make sure whatever remedy is enforced and then fund the competition that you want to emerge to assure that it doesn't emerge in another competing country.    If you don't take those extra steps, you won't address the bad behavior effectively, or you are more likely to cause the nation to lose another industry -- and each company needs a different remedy.       The Ombudsman Approach   When the problem is an abuse of excessive power, the one remedy that can work is to mitigate that power with more powerful oversight.  Complaints are routed to that entity, who then aggregates them and decides on a response based on the nature of the complaint.  The position has to be staffed well enough to be able to deal with the complaints and have enough authority to assure that the resulting punitive remedy, if the complaint holds up, is strong enough to change the underlying behavior.    The goal of the effort, either put in place by ruling or consent decree, is to remove the power imbalance that is at the heart of the bad behavior but not cripple the company so it can't compete.  The ombudsman (but applied to the private sector) should have the apparent power not only to fine the company but also the individuals in charge.    Besides that, the ombudsman should have the authority to set the amount of the fines as well as provide financial remedies for those harmed by the bad behavior.  A special effort, in the case of Google, to better balance income between the information aggregators and those producing information, is also necessary if the nation's free press is to be sustained.    In other words, the approach needs to be surgical because you don't want to kill the patient; you want it to start behaving in a way that isn't damaging the country or its citizens.   Wrapping Up   In watching the testimony, I agree that the firms have all been misbehaving and doing harm because they lacked sufficient oversight.  You wouldn't fix a misbehaving child by carving them up, but instead by giving them adequate oversight, punishments, and incentives.  That is more the role of an Ombudsman.    If we look at Microsoft's recovery from their antitrust issues, they came out of the process not only more successful than they went into it, but with what appears to be sustained behavior modifications where they favor things like open source and interoperability rather than fight it.    But given this is a recurring problem, perhaps part of the remedy is to empower the Federal Trade Commission to more aggressively oversee all large companies with enough clout to make it so large firms don't screw up in the first place.  The cost to the country of killing large numbers of small innovative companies is high and more aggressively preventing that should be part of the remedy.    Often in these cases, the small companies that initially complain are long gone by the time the eventual remedy is put in place. That is a loss of capability that almost assures the next tech wave will occur someplace else.  Assuring that doesn't happen should also be a far higher priority than it is.       I just ran into ActiveWords last week, and it is a fascinating and rather simple productivity booster for folks that write a lot.    It allows you to create your macros very quickly for phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or pages you use a lot in writing.    You can also train it to launch apps with a couple of letters, open web pages, act on selected tests, carry out scripted sequences, date and time stamp, and AutoCorrect and Auto Text when needed.    For someone who writes a lot, it could take hours of repetitive typing out of your workday, allow you to get far more done in a given period, and work faster.    Now, the only group that seems not to like this app are people that are paid by the hour; and the groups that love the app are those paid by the word, by the project, or salaried.     ActiveWords 4    The product costs US$30 a year for an individual, but you can try it free for 60 days to see if it helps the way you work.

The medium of the event itself \u2014 like so many pandemic-era events, it's expected to take place via internet videoconference \u2014 is a sign of how profoundly the tech industry has reshaped public life. Background: The last time Congress took on Big Tech at this level was in April 2018, when Zuckerberg appeared before committees from both House and Senate[1] to defend Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal and questions about its role in the 2016 election. </p><p>Pichai also testified[2] before House Judiciary in Dec. 2018 about charges Google is biased against conservatives.Cook testified about Apple's taxes[3] before the Senate's Permanent Committee on Investigations in 2013. Bezos has never before appeared on the Hill. These CEOs follow in a long line of powerful industry leaders who have volunteered to take their lumps before lawmakers in hope of forestalling punitive legislation and winning over the public. Bank CEOs and pharma CEOs both testified before Congress in group panels in 2019.In 2008, CEOs of the big three U.S. automakers showed up for several hearings related to financial-crisis bailouts, and faced criticism for flying in on private jets. Oil CEOs defended record profits at a 2005 hearing.In previous eras, Congress hauled in[4] John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. The appearances don't always pay off. Bill Gates' defiant, sometimes contemptuous Senate testimony in 1998 helped ensure that Microsoft would end up targeted with a federal antitrust lawsuit.When seven tobacco company CEOs told Congress in 1994 that cigarettes aren't addictive[5], they cemented a reputation for deception. How it will work: The format for the tech hearing has not yet been finalized, according to several sources, but the most likely scenario right now is testimony from all four CEOs on the same panel, rather than one after another. We're unlikely to see photos of the CEOs lined up in front of microphones with congressional inquisitors arced around them. Instead, they'll be in the same video rectangles the rest of us get to inhabit today.The plans are already drawing criticism. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) demanded that the hearing be held before the full committee, rather than the antitrust subcommittee, in a letter to committee chairman Jerrold Nadler Tuesday. Of note: Microsoft, the target of Washington's relentless scrutiny 20 years ago, is no longer grouped with the other companies as a target for inquiry. This is either a sign of Microsoft's latter-day success at finding accommodation with regulators and the public, an indication that the company isn't the dominant force it once was \u2014 or, most likely, a bit of both. Our thought bubble: Steve Jobs never testified before Congress.

Google was a no-show. For years, I have called for anti-trust legislation, as social media is the new public square. Even Jack Dorsey admitted at the hearings today that Twitter is the 'public square.'[1] And while all are hailing today's hearings, I am not nearly as optimistic. </p><p>The premise of these hearings are false. Lawmakers called for greater federal regulations to ensure the United States does not repeat the mistakes of the 2016 presidential election, where Russia played a key role in infiltrating these social media sites. The left, responsible for this war on free speech, is orchestrating this farce. It is absurd and dangerous. When will the GOP stop prostrating themselves before their destroyers? Time to turn the tables. The hearing, titled 'Foreign Influence Operations' Use of Social Media Platforms[2],' comes with the 2018 U.S. midterms just two months away. Numerous tech companies have already announced the discovery of foreign influence campaigns, including Facebook, which has cracked down on what it called 'coordinated inauthentic behavior[3].' Wednesday's hearing is the biggest for the tech industry since April, when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced almost five hours of questions[4] from the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. A few ads did not influence the elections. Google could face some blowback over its no show. Many senators seemed legitimately angry that the company had not sent a senior executive. Here is what these hearings should be addressing:[5] If 'knowledge is power' and 'The pen is mightier than the sword,' entities controlling what pens you see are powerful indeed. Facebook and Google 'account for 75% of all the referrals major news and entertainment sites now receive,' according[6] to a [2016] Politico report. Facebook boasts[7] a 40 percent share of the social media market and 1.5 billion users worldwide, making this Internet 'nation' more populous than any country on Earth. Upwards[8] of 40 percent of American adults get news from the site. Google accounts[9] for 64 percent of all U.S. desktop search queries. In Europe, the figure is a whopping[10] 90 percent. The company also owns YouTube, the world's most popular video-sharing website. How is this power used? Earlier this year, ex-Facebook employees admitted[11] they routinely suppressed conservative news and were ordered to place relatively unpopular but company-favored (read: liberal) stories in their 'trending' news section. And trending means mind-bending because people are influenced by what's 'popular.' Make an article appear more or less so and you can cause some readers to embrace it as 'consensus' or dismiss it as a fringe view. It snowballs, too: prominent placement makes a piece more popular, which makes it more prominent, which makes it yet more popular, which makeswell, you get the idea. Now the social-media site \u2014 dubbed[12] 'Fakebook' by many \u2014 states[13] it will label and essentially bury 'fake news,' using as fact-checkers liberal outlets such as Snopes.com, Politifact and ABC, which themselves have peddled falsehoods (see here[14], here[15] and here[16]). And Google? In its June piece 'The New Censorship,' U.S. News and World Report lists nine blacklists Google maintains. The site asks, 'How did Google become the internet's censor and master manipulator, blocking access to millions of websites?' Moreover, the search giant announced[17] last year that it was considering ranking sites not just based on popularity (which reflects the market), but on 'truthfulness' \u2014 as determined, of course, by Google's Democrat-donating[18] techies. Blacklisting can be devastating, too, as what befell two normal businesses illustrates. As U.S. News also reported, 'Heading into the holiday season in late 2013,an online handbag business[19]suffered a 50 percent drop in business because of blacklisting. In 2009, it tookan eco-friendly pest control company[20]60 days to leap the hurdles required to remove Google's warnings, long enough to nearly go broke.' Likewise, stigmatize a media website with blacklisting or, more deviously, by burying its result on the eighth search page (Web users generally examine only the first few pages), and you could dry up its revenue \u2014 and readership. Thus, this tactic sends politically incorrect views to Internet Siberia, where few will hear the dissenters except their fellow Google-gulag inmates. One victim was combative PC Magazine columnist John Dvorak, whose website and podcast site were blacklisted[21] in 2013. This prompted him to ask, 'When Did Google Become the Internet Police?' Answer: a long time before. In 2006, the company terminated[22] its news relationship with some conservative news sites critical of Islam. So is it time to break up Facebook and Google? In principle, I may object to such things. But here's the issue: if antitrust laws are unjust, eliminate them. But if we're going to have them, they should be applied where most needed. As for Google, most people admits it's 'a de facto monopoly.' Libertarian tech investor Peter Thiel and ex-Microsoft CEOSteve Ballmer both think so, and even 'Google chairman Eric Schmidt has admitted 'we're in that area.' Congress Wants Tighter Regulation of Social Media Giants Ahead of Midterm Elections Facebook, Twitter in hot seat at congressional hearingBy Adam Kredo, WFB, September 5, 2018:Congress is eying a series of new regulations to tighten federal oversight of social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter amid fears that foreign governments and rogue regimes will attempt to sway the 2018 midterm elections. Top leaders from Facebook and Twitter participated in a congressional hearing with the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday morning, where they faced an onslaught of questions about the ways in which these tech giants handle the personal information of millions of Americans. The leaders defended their practices of censorship and sharing personal data with third parties as lawmakers called for greater federal regulations to ensure the United States does not repeat the mistakes of the 2016 presidential election, where Russia played a key role in infiltrating these social media sites. Wednesday's hearing, the fourth of its kind, comes just weeks after Facebook and Twitter discovered and removed hundreds of fake accounts run by Iran. Lawmakers on the committee described the current situation as a major national security threat that must be dealt with in the short-term. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey both appeared before the intelligence committee, while Google declined to allow its chief official, Larry Page, to attend the hearing, a move met with consternation by lawmakers. Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) grilled Twitter and Facebook about the ways in which they share personal information with advertisers and others. 'The prospect of that data being shared with shady businesses, hackers, and foreign governments is a massive privacy and national security concern,' Wyden said. 'The Russians keep looking for more sophisticated ways of attacking our democracy. Personal data reveals not just your personal and political leanings, but also what you buy and even who you date.' 'My view is personal data is now the weapon of choice for political influence campaigns and we must not make it easier for our adversaries to seize these weapons and use them against us,' Wyden said while discussing ways Congress can assist in this issue. Sandberg and Dorsey both agreed with Wyden that the issue should be viewed as a top national security priority. Sandberg was not particularly forthcoming about findings in a series of audits outlining how Facebook shares Americans' personal information. Those findings have remained secret, though Wyden is pushing for their public release. In one instance, Facebook was found to be sharing personal information with smartphone manufacturers and Chinese companies such as ZTE. 'The American people deserve to see this information,' Wyden said. 'Will you commit to making public the portion of your audits that relate to Facebook's partnerships with smart phone manufacturers?' Sandberg bristled at the question, but said the company would attempt to do so at some point in the future.

During the hear...</p><p>Congress proves how shallow and absurd its anti-tech agenda is. Political preening, petty grievances, and a terrifying cluelessness ruled House lawmakers' Thursday questioning of the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google .   During the hearing, Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee took turns offering a series of stern looks and fiery (if unsupported by anything more than anecdote) allegations about the illegal, un-American, cop-hating, Communist-supporting, Russian disinformation-spreading, election-throwing, child-abuse-enabling, small-business-quashing, app-suppressing, mob-like, conspiracy-minded, all-powerful behaviors of America's most valuable companies.   Lawmakers barely let the tech CEOs\u2014Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg\u2014get a few words out between their wild accusations. And they quickly glossed over any complicated issues, clearly preferring to spend their allotted questioning time getting good video clips of themselves.   As Reason 's Eric Boehm and Robby Soave explained in posts yesterday, lawmakers spent the time \"using the threat of antitrust action to try to force tech firms to take sides \" in political battles and couldn't even keep straight which companies they were mad at for which things.   It was almost enough to make you feel for Zuckerberg, even (almost). Certainly, poor Cook didn't belong there. And\u2014whatever legitimate (and diverse) issues there are with some of the ways their companies do business\u2014none of them deserved the insults and inanity they were subjected to yesterday.   The telehearing stretched on for hours, over the course of which it became abundantly clear that Democrats and Republicans are often diametrically opposed in their grievances while acting like satisfying them is only a matter of tech leaders choosing to do the Right Thing. Neither side admitted that acting as it wished would run afoul of the supposedly simple and common-sense things their opponents wanted \"Big Tech\" to do.   The most dramatic of these tensions involves web content moderation. It's not that far off to say Democrats want these companies to suppress more content and Republicans want them to allow more content without question.   Democrats are worried about \"hate speech\" and disinformation; Republicans are worried about being labeled as hate speech or disinformation.   Was just thinking this. There's no way they can win. Each member is demanding they do opposite things. Wtf <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/CyoXZttfvo\">https://t.co/CyoXZttfvo</url>   \u2014 Shoshana Weissmann, Sloth Committee Chair ???? (@senatorshoshana) July 29, 2020   Even within the same side and sometimes the same individual, there were contradictory complaints about tech companies and implications about what they should do.   For instance, when it came to marketplaces like Apple's app and podcast stores, or Amazon more broadly, some committee members acted as if it was dangerously anti-competitive for these companies to reject many podcasts, apps, goods, etc., or to give preferential treatment to their own products and services. Yet Bezos and Cook were also excoriated by lawmakers for failing to completely weed out misleading, offensive, or counterfeit items.   Rep. McBath complains that Apple can exclude apps from the app store.   So like\u2026 any other product at any other store?   My favorite restaurant eliminated my favorite dish a couple of years ago. I'll be contacting Rep. McBath's office directly for help.   \u2014 Patrick Hedger (@PatHedger18) July 29, 2020   Neither Republicans nor Democrats on the committee would acknowledge the huge tension between expecting tech platforms to be open marketplaces in order to foster competition, avoid discrimination, eschew bias, and satisfy (a perverted version of) antitrust law while simultaneously expecting them to actively thwart spammers, scammers, fakers, foreign influence, sex ads, bigotry, and all the other bad things.   And neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed at all keen on letting these private companies make business decisions as they see fit, with politicians from both parties describing their basic business activities (like trying to improve products, keeping up with current tech trends, etc) as nefarious conspiracies.   gop: fuck your business  dems: fuck the concept of business at the conceptual level   \u2014 Mike Solana (@micsolana) July 29, 2020   If these companies were truly monopolies, then they wouldn't have to keep changing their products to keep the market happy. Yet over and over the Reps seem mad that these companies keep innovating to keep up with the market\u2026   \u2014 Mike Masnick (@mmasnick) July 29, 2020   \"Undoubtedly, the motivation for many politicians on both sides of the aisle\" with anti-tech stuff \"is to score political points for standing up to big corporations. Such a David and Goliath narrative plays well on the campaign trail,\" notes Casey Given at the Washington Examiner .   In order for them to be the good guys, they need tech leaders to be bad guys.   But keep in mind that this wasn't just some lark\u2014 the committee launched this investigation \"more than a year ago,\" with the alleged objectives of \"document[ing] competition problems in the digital economy\" and evaluating \"whether the current antitrust framework is able to properly address them.\"   If yesterday was any indication, it is not.   None of the tech-company docs they dug through or other investigative measures seem to have yielded new or damning information about Apple, Amazon, Facebook, or Google. A handful of gripes from these companies' competitors or customers was almost all Congress offered by way of \"evidence.\" And most of yesterday's questions weren't even about antitrust concerns but election integrity, Section 230, content moderation, stopping crime, protecting civil liberties, etc.   Lawmakers yesterday repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding about communications law as it exists and how tech products work.   Rep Cicillene: \"If a TV station airs a false political ad they're held responsible for that\u2026\" This is absolutely false. They are specifically shielded from liability by law for false political ads.   \u2014 Julian Sanchez (@normative) July 29, 2020   Hahahahahahah. @RepGregSteube is complaining that his campaign emails are going to spam (which he thinks only happens to Republicans). Uh, no dude. YOUR RECIPIENTS MARKED THEM AS SPAM.   \u2014 Mike Masnick (@mmasnick) July 29, 2020   Here is your reminder that EVERY major company collects data to create private-label brands. It is entirely legal.   Have these politicians been to Trader Joe's? Walmart? CVS? <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/ye6B9B9a0A\">https://t.co/ye6B9B9a0A</url>   \u2014 Billy Binion (@billybinion) July 29, 2020   Congressional hearings are where politicians insult and ridicule successful business people for not being as stupid as they are. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/2sv9gxywjk\">https://t.co/2sv9gxywjk</url>   \u2014 Angry Husky (@Angry_Husky) July 30, 2020   Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked if any of them opposed \"American values\" and demanded a pledge to continue working with police.   Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R\u2013N.D.), bless his heart, was the only member who asked how tech companies are going to protect user data from the police. Armstrong also pointed out that privacy laws can actually help big, entrenched businesses and burden or stop smaller competitors.   Anyway, if you want some quick and potent evidence that this was all about partisan mudslinging, scapegoating, and trying to use search engines, social media, and tech marketplaces to their respective party's advantage, check out the House Judiciary Democrats and House Judiciary GOP Twitter feeds.   Stories from competitors are anecdotes not evidence. With all these documents and time, we'd expect a solid case against these businesses.   Calling someone a monopoly (especially when sitting next to direct competitors) doesn't make it so.   No consumer harm shown. No antitrust. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/38q23nKAqy\">https://t.co/38q23nKAqy</url>   \u2014 Carl Szabo (@CarlSzabo) July 29, 2020   The bottom line, as Boehm wrote yesterday: \"Wednesday's hearing of the House Judiciary Committee was more about theatrics than seriously considering the use of antitrust law. Perhaps that's because it's somewhat ridiculous to argue with a straight face that Google or Amazon are actually monopolies, or because it's quite obvious that consumers who dislike Apple's or Facebook's products are perfectly free to give their time, money, and business to competitors on or off the web.\"   One more thing: in all the culture war and political posturing, we often overlook the fact that media businesses\u2014emphasis on the business part there\u2014are pushing political investigations and government regulations out of animosity toward tech companies cutting into their ad revenue and audiences. We shouldn't:   REMINDER: The media is a special interest @RepJerryNadler ignores the fact that publisher revenues came from controlling local monopolies on information distribution with high capital costs.   Congress shouldn't prop up antiquated business models. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/XbxHGrDMW1\">https://t.co/XbxHGrDMW1</url>   \u2014 Jesse Blumenthal (@jessekblum) July 29, 2020  ELECTION 2020  Uh oh:   With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history.

David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the subcommittee chairman, presided over the hearing. His panel is beginning a broad re-examination of the nation's antitrust laws and how they can address the market power of the most highly capitalized corporations in the country. </p><p>This investigation has bipartisan support from the Judiciary Committee chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), and the committee's ranking member, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.).Tuesday's hearing was built around bipartisan legislation offered by Cicilline and Collins[1]. Their bill would allow news publishers to band together in order to negotiate with digital platforms like Facebook and Google that are monopolizing the online advertising market. Current antitrust laws forbid news publishers from working together in that way.'The current antitrust laws protect Google and Facebook from us,' said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade group for thousands of large and small newspapers.Chavern endorsed the chairman's bill as a short-term means of saving an industry 'in crisis.''This bill is a life support measure, not a plan for longtime health,' Cicilline agreed.Throughout the hearing, committee members shared stories about the struggles of their local papers in disparate communities, from the urban Seattle of Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) to the rural North Dakota of Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.).In the past 15 years, local newspapers have closed in more than 1,400 cities and towns[2] due to a collapse in advertising revenue. Pittsburgh supplanted New Orleans as the largest city without a daily print newspaper[3] in 2018.The problem is that over that same period of time,much of the advertising revenue that once went to print news publishers was redirected to online platforms. In even more recent years, Facebook and Google have sucked up almost all of the new online advertising dollars at the expense of all other publishers.Thisduopolization of online ad money[4]hasn't just hit local newspapers with layoffs and closures. It's also hurting online publishers like HuffPost and BuzzFeed. We should be worried about losing newspapers, the fountainheads within the local news ecosystem. It is worth considering stories that would go untold.Kevin Riley, editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution In terms of protecting the news media's long-term health, committee members and hearing witnesses discussed options ranging from using existing antitrust laws to break up the online platforms and increase competition[5], tomandating interoperability between platforms[6], to changing the liability protection granted to platforms by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[7].David Pitofsky, general counsel for NewsCorp \u2015 the media conglomerate that owns The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins Publishing and Fox News \u2015 said that Congress needs to 'follow the money' to examine how these digital giants monopolized advertising money through their control of ad tech platforms.House lawmakers are concerned about more than the damage done to a local industry. The collapse of news publishers due to the loss of ad money is causing a collapse in local accountability. Studies show that municipalities that lose their local papers see an increase in corruption and an increase in government borrowing costs[8] (possibly due to the decrease in information about and quality of the local government).Kevin Riley, the editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, testified about the blockbuster report his paper produced on standardized test cheating in Atlanta public schools. It was a report that only a local newspaper with significant resources could pull off.'We should be worried about losing newspapers, the fountainheads within the local news ecosystem,' Riley said. 'It is worth considering stories that would go untold.'

Our first witness is David Marcus, Calibra's CEO. Following his testimony, a panel of experts will share their views on Facebook's plans.</p><p>I have serious concerns with Facebook's plans to create a digital currency and digital wallet and its efforts to enlist partners that expand its reach, like Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Uber, Lyft, and Spotify. Facebook is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that is intended to rival the U.S. dollar. This venture is slated to be based in Switzerland, which has a history as a monetary haven for criminals and shady corporations. Facebook's plans raise serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns, not only for Facebook's over 2 billion users, who will have immediate access to these products, but also for consumers, investors and the global economy.</p><p>In addition, Facebook has proposed backing Libra tokens with government currencies and government guaranteed securities, and holding them in a so-called Libra Reserve, to be governed by Facebook and its partners. Ownership of government assets on such a massive scale without proper oversight threatens to concentrate government influence in the hands of a few elites. Ultimately, if Facebook's plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments.</p><p>Facebook's proposed entry into financial services is all the more troubling because it has already harmed vast numbers of people on a scale similar to Wells Fargo, and demonstrated a pattern of failing to keep consumer data private on a scale similar to Equifax. Facebook remains under a 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for deceiving consumers and failing to keep consumer data private. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook provided 50 million users' private data to a political consulting firm, the company will reportedly pay a record $5 billion fine to the FTC for data privacy failures. In addition, Facebook has allegedly: insecurely stored user passwords dating back to 2012; paid unsuspecting teenagers to download spyware; experienced a hack of nearly 50 million accounts; and experienced a software bug that granted third party access to 6.8 million users' photos. It has also been sued by HUD and civil rights groups for violations of the Fair Housing Act in what amounts to modern day redlining. Facebook also allowed malicious Russian state actors to purchase and target ads in a campaign to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>I am also concerned about the lack of diversity in Facebook's upper ranks, and fear that if these plans go forward, women and minorities and women- and minority-owned businesses may be excluded from participating fully.</p><p>In light of these and other concerns, my colleagues and I wrote to Facebook earlier this month to call on it to cease implementation of its plans until regulators and Congress can examine the issues associated with a large technology company developing a digital currency, and take action. The Independent Community Bankers of America and others support this commonsense step.</p><p>Facebook's plans also raise larger concerns about Big Tech's expansion into financial services, as it appears to inappropriately mix commerce and banking activities. So, today we will discuss a draft bill, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prevent large platform utilities like Facebook from becoming financial institutions and block them from creating their own currencies.</p><p>Today's hearing is only the first step in our oversight and legislative process. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.

The president's targets, all women of color, are fighting back, rejecting his suggestion that they hate America and should go back where they came from.</p><p>They say they disagree with the president's policies, especially the treatment of migrants coming to the U.S., and they are working to make the country a better place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): And so the first note that I want to tell children across this country is that, no matter what the president says, this country belongs to you. And it belongs to everyone. And today, that notion, that very notion was challenged. This weekend that very notion was challenged.</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI), MAJORITY MEMBER, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM: As we all know, the recent tweets and words from the president are simply a continuation of his racist and xenophobic playbook.</p><p>We cannot allow these hateful actions by the president to distract us from the critical work to hold this administration accountable to the inhumane conditions at the border that is separating children from their loved ones and caging them up in illegal horrific conditions.</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): He is launching a blatantly racist attack on four duly elected members of the United States of House of Representatives, all of whom are women of color. This is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms, or it's happening on national TV and now it's reached the White House garden.</p><p>REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA), MAJORITY MEMBER, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM: I encourage the American people and all of us in this room and beyond to not take the bait. This is a disruptive distraction from the issues of care, concern and consequence to the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now President Trump was back on Twitter during the congresswoman's news conference, tweeting, \"The Dems are trying to distance themselves from the four progressives but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing socialism, hate of Israel and the USA. Not good for the Democrats.\"</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta has more now, from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump is defending his racist attacks on Twitter, telling reporters he's not concerned that his tweets, aimed at four Democratic women of color in Congress, may appeal to white nationalists.</p><p>TRUMP: It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me and all I'm saying -- they want to leave, they can leave. Now it doesn't say leave forever. It says leave.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Referring to congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, the president tweeted that they can go back to where they came from.</p><p>But three of them were born in the U.S. The fourth, Omar, came here as a child and became a citizen. There were no apologies from Mr. Trump as he took his incendiary rhetoric one step further, telling the women they can leave the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. And that is what I say all the time. That is what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial.</p><p>A lot of people love it, by the way. A lot of people love it. But if you're not happy in the U.S., if you're complaining all the time, very simply, can you leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want. Don't come back. It's OK, too. But if you're not happy, you can leave.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): The president also fired back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who tweeted that the slogan \"make America great again\" has always been about making America white again.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, that is just a very racist statement, somebody that would say that. So Speaker Pelosi said make America white again, let me tell you, that is a very racist -- that is a very racist statement. I'm surprised she would say that.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): But the president's race-baiting rhetoric has been a cornerstone of his rise in American politics, going back to his birther attacks on Barack Obama.</p><p>TRUMP: People are trying to figure out --</p><p>[02:05:00]</p><p>TRUMP: -- why isn't he giving his birth certificate. It's not a birth certificate.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): That is racist: Obama was born in Hawaii.</p><p>Then there were his comments about immigrants crossing the Mexican border as he launched his campaign.</p><p>TRUMP: They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): That is racist, too. Then there was his equivocating over white nationalists and neo-Nazis spreading violence in Charlottesville.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest --</p><p>TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. They didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis. And you had some very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Democrats say it is all part of a pattern.</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D-TX), FORMER HUD SECRETARY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Everybody knows that the president acts like a white supremacist, he is a racist, he's made that clear on so many different occasions.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Top administration officials are hardly eager to answer for the president's racist tweets.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: What I already said is I think the president clarified his comment. I understand what the president's comment is. I'm not concerned by the president's comment and, again, that is the last comment I'm going to make on this issue.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Yet the president still has plenty of allies inside the GOP backing him up.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own country. They're anti-Semitic. They're anti-America.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ACOSTA: White House officials are more than willing to defend the president in private. A senior White House official recently told me the president was not a racist but when asked if that comment could be stated on the record, the official declined -- Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Senior political analyst Ron Brownstein joins me here, he's also senior editor at \"The Atlantic.\"</p><p>Ron, gone are the days that we could expect any kind of contrition from the president or any kind of reflection but instead what we got today was really interesting in the sense that he said, you know what?</p><p>A lot of people agree with me. And I want to talk to you about that, because while I have heard a lot from people in terms of the president doesn't believe in diversity, the president is racist, the president is a bigot, at the end of the day, you tell me what you think.</p><p>Is this not a question of the fact that he is tapping into the voter base that thinks exactly as he does?</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: He is tapping into a voter base that things exactly as he does. But he is uttering remarks that are racist and that are bigoted that probably haven't been uttered by a president since Andrew Johnson in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, by any national figure in America since George Wallace.</p><p>The challenge that he faces is the sentiment that he is expressing, are almost certainly not acceptable to a majority of Americans.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWTON: But let me stop you there, Ron, because it's a good idea to remind people about what happened in 2016 because we had lots of people write lots of inches of columns about the fact that Trump could never win with this, because he just wouldn't appeal to the independents. Guess what, the electoral college got him up there. And he won.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: And that's his vision, this has never been a presidency about trying to court a majority of the American public. This has been about holding a passionate base that he thinks will allow him to squeeze out an electoral college victory without winning a majority of the popular vote.</p><p>He's the only president in the history to go this far in his presidency without getting majority support. This is another expression of that belief.</p><p>But it is an enormous gamble, because what it means is that he is consistently, through his presidency, not only through these comments but through his policy like border separation and the border wall and the census question on citizenship and the ICE raids that he touted, he is trying to draw the line in the electorate around a different access, an access of, are you comfortable with the demographic and social changes we are remaking in America in the 20th century or do you view those as a threat to you?</p><p>And in doing that, he is consciously putting the Republican Party in a position where it is treating growing constituencies, like young people, minorities, college educated white voters and people who live in big metro areas and are U.S., for constituencies that are shrinking. Older voters, blue collar voters, a non urban voters and trying to make up the difference by squeezing bigger margins out of shrinking groups.</p><p>That is the core bet of that of Trump's political calculation, it is the bet that the Republican parties accepting and no one is saying it can't work in 2020, I agree with you, he may be able to squeeze out another electoral college victory.</p><p>But it is really drawing to an inside straight as the country continues to diversify. Don't forget, every four years, the non college whites at the center of his electoral coalition shrink by --</p><p>[02:10:00]</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: -- 2 points of a share of the national electorate and minorities and college whites, who are the most resistant to those kind of talks in the presidency grow by 2 points. So the treadmill, the angle on the treadmill gets turned up a little higher in 2020, than 2016, can you make it work?</p><p>Sure. But the latest polling, he's trailing Joe Biden by 10 points at a time where unemployment is under 4 percent.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes that is incredible when you put it that way and yet listen, the results of 2016 were incredible in their own way, when you consider how far Hillary Clinton went in terms of winning the popular vote.</p><p>Let's talk about the reaction today, so we have the reaction within the Trump cabinet -- or I would say lack of reaction. I want you to listen to Marc Short, who's chief of staff for Mike Pence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think the president's tweets were racist?</p><p>MARC SHORT, PENCE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think that since returning to the White House, one of the greatest pleasures that I've had is joining the vice president on Independence Day when he's swearing 50 new naturalized citizens.</p><p>And I wish there had been more of you guys president for those ceremonies on the National Archives. He was drawing that day by cabinet member in this administration, who came to the United States as a young child, unable to speak English, learning English and became a naturalized citizen. She still serves in our cabinet, Elaine Chao.</p><p>I don't think the president intended to be racist, I think he's tried to point out the fact that since elected it's had to find anything Ilhan Omar said that actually supports the United States of America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: You're not going to get me started on this comment, I'm going to let you take it over. Because, my God, glaring there what a member of the inner circle there had to say about Trump's behavior.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Sure and, of course, today Trump's kind of escalated because he kind of married George Wallace with Joe McCarthy, essentially following Lindsey Graham this morning, who's said, these four Democrats are communists who are anti American and hate our own country.</p><p>Pretty nimble minuet for a president who was having a bromance with the leader of Russia and winking at his interference in American elections, to accuse someone who disagrees with him of being a communist.</p><p>Can you imagine, for listeners around the world, a CEO of any major company, in any country, telling a prominent internal critic of his policies that they should go back to their home country because they disagree with him?</p><p>How long could that CEO survive before a board of directors?</p><p>And yet we have Republicans kind of twisting themselves into pretzels, not all of them, a handful, a trickle have come out and said this is racist and xenophobic, to try to explain away.</p><p>And it just underscores the extent to which the GOP has already moved in a Trumpian direction. Only about 10 percent of the House Republicans represent districts where immigrants equal or exceed their share of the rest of the population. Less than 20 percent hold seats where minorities equal or exceed the share of the national population, there are only eight Republican senators out of the 40 from the 20 states that have the highest share of immigrants, in many ways the Republican Party is now barricaded off in the parts of America that are least touched by and most hostile to demographic change in general and immigration in particular.</p><p>And that is another reason why you are not hearing much. In many ways, most, many of the Republicans are appealing to the very same constituencies that Trump is hoping to mobilize with this rhetoric and the policies that we discussed.</p><p>NEWTON: And the fact is they do believe it is a winning strategy for 2020 and that is why we are going to hear so much more of, it Ron, thanks so much I really appreciated.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: Demonstrators across the U.S. are protesting Trump administration policies targeting undocumented immigrants.</p><p>In New York, dozens of pro immigrant rights activists were arrested for blocking traffic in Manhattan. And right here in Atlanta, more than 100 protesters gathered outside an Immigration Customs and Enforcement field office. Officials say they are going after about 2,000 migrants ordered by the courts to be removed from the United States.</p><p>Amid the outrage, Mr. Trump says the raids have already been in his words, very successful. But immigrants rights groups in the meantime say there have actually been few signs that they are even underway.</p><p>This comes as the Trump administration is enacting in new rule that will drastically limit Central American migrants from claiming asylum in the United States. The rule requires migrants who have lived in or travel through a third country on the way to the U.S., to first to seek asylum in that country.</p><p>You will remember this was also very controversial in Europe and that means that most migrants passing through Mexico will now be blocked. Nick Paton Walsh has more from Mexico City.</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Trump administration has done all it can to make the journey practically of Central Americans --</p><p>[02:15:00]</p><p>WALSH: -- getting to the United States as difficult as possible. But this is a legal move to potentially make that journey entirely pointless.</p><p>What the Trump administration will do on Tuesday, is publish in the Federal Register a new rule that basically says, if you travel through a country to get to the U.S.-Mexico border, it is in that country that Central Americans should be requesting asylum.</p><p>It moves to invalidate them from getting requests for asylum in the United States. That will face obviously legal challenges, certainly, and it may get knocked down or it may certainly slow the passage of people trying to get into the U.S., because Mexico's foreign minister, a reaction, saying this will not affect Mexicans, that is entirely true.</p><p>And pledging, of course, to stand up for human rights of Mexicans, if some of them are caught in the ongoing ICE raids that happens across the United States now. But this particular legal challenge as one of the number of things that the Trump administration is trying to do to slow the passage of tens of thousands of Central Americans up through Mexico towards their border.</p><p>They did try to hatch an agreement with Guatemala to declare itself a third safe country, meaning that Central Americans passing through it would actually have to apply for asylum in Guatemala, entirely and, of course, they pressured the Mexican government to send troops, the National Guard down to the Mexico and Guatemalan border to slow the flood of people across that border as well.</p><p>But the particular legal challenge is stark, it's had human rights activists and advocates saying it will face legal challenges in the court so they've warned you are essentially pushing migrants, desperate many of them for a better life and to escape the perils of their home countries, to much more dangerous measures.</p><p>Do they potentially have to take to the seas to get around Mexico, in order to not have passed through another country and lose the U.S. asylum claim?</p><p>Lots of questions but increasing concerns, for the face of often whole families that are trying to take this particular journey and the Trump administration's clear march towards making that passage as impossible as they can -- Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Mexico City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: That safe country is already in place between Canada and the United States in the northern border, at least that is what U.S. officials have been pointing out.</p><p>Now to the Iranian nuclear agreement, it is now on shaky ground, with those who signed the deal besides the United States are still holding out.

Residents of Nepal, Bangladesh and India are trying to cope with the situation.</p><p>As you can see they're, quite difficult, more rain is unfortunately expected in the next several days. Joining us now live from New Delhi, is CNN's Nikhil Kumar.</p><p>Unfortunately this is a very grim ritual during monsoon season, particularly, what is concerning people this time around?</p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF: Paula, you are absolutely right, we see this pretty much every year, that when the rains arrive, particularly in these parts of the country, they're very rural where the infrastructure isn't very strong. We often hear about such devastation, flash flooding, landslides and the deaths that follow.</p><p>And as you said the death toll over the last few days has been steadily rising, it is about 110, now officials expect that number to continue rising, they have set up relief camps and so on to move people away from the most vulnerable parts.</p><p>And this comes after, just weeks ago we were talking about extreme heat, officials were trying to deal with that swing. And the rains as you say, still have longer to play out but already they have caused immense devastation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KUMAR (voice-over): First came the heat, killing more than 130 people across India. In Dhar (ph) state alone, more than 100 people died. The worst ever heat related death toll ever recorded.</p><p>On the other side of the country, Maharashtra state suffered its worst drought in decades. And then came the floods, just as devastating, as the climate swung like a destructive pendulum.</p><p>In the capital of Mumbai, it was hit by the heaviest rainfall in more than a decade, bringing the city to a standstill. Building walls collapsed, railway stations and highways were overrun with water.</p><p>And now, heavy downpours in Bihar and surrounding states as well as parts of neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh, have killed scores of people in recent days. Millions face devastation. Experts say the climate crisis makes such extreme swings in the weather more and more likely.</p><p>ARUNABHA GHOSH, CLIMATE EXPERT: Between the mid 1980s and the mid- 2010s, India was hit by about 300 extreme weather events. But most of those happened after 2005. So there is an increase in the intensity and the frequency of extreme weather events.</p><p>KUMAR (voice-over): Chennai, India's sixth largest city it has become a symbol of this problem. Unusually heavy rainfall in 2015 triggered widespread flooding. And this year, it has almost run out of water, following lower than usual rainfall. The city's infrastructure was simply not prepared to deal with the swings in the weather, which money warned is a nationwide problem.</p><p>GHOSH: The infrastructure's clearly not fit for purpose. So our infrastructure, whether it's in terms of storm water drains, flood defenses, protection of communities, especially the poorer communities, our transportation systems, these have to become far more resilient.</p><p>KUMAR (voice-over): Failing to do so doesn't just have an economic cost. This extreme weather places havoc with the country's infrastructure. It also puts millions more Indians in mortal danger.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KUMAR: So Paula, as you can see, even as we talk about the rising death toll in recent days and we keep tracking what happens, as the rain and the monsoon rain spread across this region, this is the largest story.</p><p>As we step back, the swing from the extreme heat to now, these floods. We spoke to an official yesterday in a state that has been badly, affected and that is what he was talking about. He was talking about --</p><p>[02:25:00]</p><p>KUMAR: -- the fact that just weeks ago, all these people, they were dealing with the heat wave, with the devastation that that has caused and now all of a sudden, they were having to shift gears to deal with this flooding, with the rains and moving people away from the vulnerable areas. And that is the larger picture here, the fallout from the climate crisis and the swings in weather that this region has been seen for the last several years, the experts tell us we will continue to see for the foreseeable future.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes it must be incredibly stressful for those who are looking for some respite and it is not going to be on the horizon anytime soon.

Now, in the CNN exclusive, Alex Marquardt details the evidence found in scores of surveillance reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, Ecuador's embassy in London turned into a command post for WikiLeaks. At its helm the Web site's founder, Julian Assange was living there in political asylum. In stunning new detail, hundreds of security reports, videos, and photos obtained exclusively by CNN and verified by an Ecuadorian intelligence official described how Assange released stolen Democratic e-mails directly from the embassy and who he met with.</p><p>World-class hackers and Russians tied to the Kremlin. The explosive material when lined up with the timeline in the Mueller report, paints a striking picture of how Assange orchestrated the game-changing document dumps from just a few rooms in the embassy. The exclusively obtained surveillance reports show that the WikiLeaks founder who had been given asylum in 2012 wielded enormous power in the building, rivaling even the ambassadors with whom he would regularly clash as these exclusive security photos show, he even got physical with the embassy guards.</p><p>The documents describe how Assange demanded and got high-speed internet, phones, even a special guest list that allowed certain visitors to not show identification or be searched. Even as it hosted him, Ecuador hired three different security companies to carry out surveillance of Assange including Spain-based U.C. Global which compiled the reports obtained by CNN. The never before seen cash of documents says Assange installed his own recording devices, and used sound machine so he couldn't be listened to. All of which may have played a role in his election interference.</p><p>Assange has denied working for the Kremlin or receiving the stolen e- mails from Russia, WikiLeaks did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is temperamentally unfit to hold in office.</p><p>MARQUARDT: It was June of 2016, Trump and Hillary Clinton were the de facto nominees, and it was looking like it was going to be a better election.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft.</p><p>MARQUARDT: That month according to the Mueller report, WikiLeaks communicated secretly with unidentified online personas who turned out to be Russian hackers. Meanwhile, the number of visits paid to Assange at the embassy dramatically picked up. The reports exclusively obtained by CNN show one frequent visitor was this man, Andrew Muller-Maguhn, a hacker whom the special counsel wrote, may have assisted with the transfer of these stolen documents to WikiLeaks.</p><p>[02:35:07] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you look at the internet from a perspective of people in power --</p><p>MARQUARDT: Muller-Maguhn had appeared on Assange's short-lived show on R.T. The Russian T.V. network that gets it marching orders from the Kremlin. The security log shows that R.T.'s London Bureau Chief Nikolay Bogachihin also visited that month twice. And during one visit that lasted only five minutes, he gave Assange a USB drive. Bogachihin defended his visits to Assange telling CNN, R.T. has produced multiple programming featuring Mr. Assange, within that process, everything that is intrinsically involved in the production of content took place.</p><p>Muller-Maguhn declined to comment to CNN but told the Washington Post he never had the hack materials before they were released. But U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded R.T. actively collaborated with WikiLeaks playing a significant role in Russia's efforts to help Trump win which R.T. denies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Russian hackers have breached the computer network of the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>MARQUARDT: On June 14th, 2016, the Democratic National Committee announced it had been hacked and accused Russia of being responsible. Trump dismissed allegations of Russian involvement instead suggesting the DNC hacked itself, five days later, according to the exclusive documents, Assange got new equipment for data transmission. The embassy security attach even helped install it.</p><p>On July 6, WikiLeaks reached out to the Russian hackers who used the names Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks. Those are covers, the Mueller report says, for Russian military intelligence. The Democratic National Convention is approaching, WikiLeaks warned the Russians and Clinton will solidify Bernie Sanders supporters behind her. Eight days later the group received encrypted files according to the Mueller report with the name big archive.</p><p>That same day Assange met again for more than four hours with Muller- Maguhn, one of at least a dozen times they met at the embassy before the election according to the security reports. On the day of the Republican National Convention kicks off, the security photos show a man in a mask and sunglasses arriving at the embassy. A guard left his post and collected a package. The documents suggest this was an arranged meeting.</p><p>It's unclear whether that was related to a message sent the same day, July 18th, when WikiLeaks told the Russian hackers according to the Mueller report, that they received the files, and would release them this week. Four days later, WikiLeaks released a trove of stolen files. And all hell breaks loose. More than 20,000 e-mails from the DNC, showing the preference of top officials for Clinton over Bernie Sanders.</p><p>When the Democratic convention opened, it was consumed by chaos. The DNC Chair had to step down and Trump pounced.</p><p>TRUMP: Russia if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.</p><p>MARQUARDT: As the election entered its final weeks, Russia, according to Mueller, wrote WikiLeaks offering more files. You won't be disappointed, the hackers wrote. After receiving several files from the Russian hackers in the immediate days prior, WikiLeaks started posting 50,000 e-mails stolen from Clinton's Campaign Chairman, John Podesta, revealing infighting and bickering.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If this was about transparency they should put them all out, so there dribbling them out.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Mueller's team suspects that transfer took place on September 19th, the same day Assange met again with hacker Muller- Maguhn, according to the security reports. In the last month before the election, WikiLeaks released batch after batch of Podesta's e- mails.</p><p>TRUMP: This just came out, WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Transcripts of Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street, staffers criticizing her terrible instincts.</p><p>TRUMP: WikiLeaks, this WikiLeaks is unbelievable.</p><p>MARQUARDT: The U.S. government decided to get involved. According to a U.S. official and documents obtained by CNN, warning Ecuador, stop Assange or there will be consequences. Just three weeks before the election, Ecuador cut Assange off. No more phones, internet or guests. Shortly after, the embassy relented on guest restrictions and at 1:00 a.m. on October 19th, the security materials obtained by CNN shows two WikiLeaks staffers showed up and took away about 100 hard drives.</p><p>Security guards wanted to examine the hard drives, but they couldn't. The WikiLeaks personnel were on that specialist of people not to be searched. One of the Ecuadorian ambassadors who worked at the embassy during Assange's stay told CNN he was never pressured by his government to give Assange special treatment.</p><p>[02:40:02] But this past April, Assange's world came crashing down. The asylum, his lifeblood, was taken away by Ecuador's new president, citing his participation in U.S. election meddling. British police carried him out of the embassy. And the U.S. Justice Department unsealed secret charges, but not for anything related to the election. Instead, it was for soliciting and publishing classified Pentagon materials in 2010.</p><p>Assange maintains his innocence. And right on cue, Russia came to Assange's defense. Top officials accusing the U.S. of violating his rights, saying the hand of democracy squeezes the throat of freedom.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARQUARDT: Julian Assange is currently in a British prison awaiting his extradition hearing, that (INAUDIBLE) takes place next February in 2020, almost a year after he was arrested. The extradition process as expected to be long and complicated. And if U.S. prosecutors get their hands on him, there is a long list of charges, including 17 counts of violating the espionage act for obtaining and publishing those classified Pentagon documents. Meaning he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.</p><p>NEWTON: And our thanks to Alex.

Is it the dominance alone that kind of engenders this kind of a backlash or something else?</p><p>PETE PACHAL, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, REVIEWS.COM: Yes, I think that's certainly a key part of it. I think Amazon is one of these things where it's not quite too big to bail but it's too big not to be a target certainly. You know, these -- all the scrutiny that's been under is partly symptomatic of what big tech is simply going through the last couple of years. And certainly, heated up ever since the Democratic primary started in earnest and there's been calls for free cups and increased regulation.</p><p>But Amazon's kind of a unique case in a lot of ways that the sheer sort of dominance of it and the scale of it is a bit scary. And also, consumers have a relationship with Amazon that's very personal. You know they, they buy things from the site whether it's a deal or not, it comes to their doorstep. You know it's kind of like Christmas. You know, you just get stuff all the time.</p><p>Well, it's an interesting point that a survey once found that Amazon as a brand is only trusted by Americans more -- it -- the only brand that's trusted more by Americans is the U.S. military. It shows sort of where people's heads are at around this company.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet trusted, and yet it's become as you said a target. Even right now, on Capitol Hill, there is large discussions about what to do about tech. And certainly, breaking it up and it is in there.</p><p>Do you think in the end that Amazon will look completely different, and let's say five to 10 years because of regulation?</p><p>[02:49:56] PACHAL: I think it's going to look different in five to 10 years, not necessarily because of regulation. I think the breakup calls -- while they're there, there are some merit there in terms of the monopolization of Amazon, Apple, Google, all these guys power, and Facebook is certainly are sort of monopolies in their own way.</p><p>There -- there's one card that the all these guys can play, and it's China, frankly. There's sort of this new tech cold war that has -- that has sort of emerged in the last several years where everyone, you know, as sort of a political fuel or a political defense for a lot of these tech companies they point to China.</p><p>So, yes, break up to Amazon. What happens to Alibaba, which accounts for 58 something percent of all e-commerce in China? And, you know, if they if Amazon -- you know, we break up Amazon, you leave it back to them. So, what rushes to fill it?</p><p>So, there's all this race to sort of beat China and the tech game, whether it's 5G, whether it's e-commerce, whether it's social media. Companies like Weibo and Tencent are huge over there.</p><p>You know the plug -- the card that tech companies plays -- you know, do you really want to leave in the vacuum here? Whether that's a valid argument or not, you know, certainly something to come fill the vacuum that isn't from China.</p><p>Maybe there's better ways to regulate. But I think that, that alone has enough of a scare factor into current today's political climate that I don't think they're going to be broken on.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet, it's interesting to see how it will evolve. I mean, we're all used to that term, Amazon, right? And in terms of it's been blamed for many things, it's principally, at first it was getting rid of the neighborhood, bookstore, it did -- those and. But so much more now.</p><p>You've pointed out, of course, they've now gone into web services. And whether that in future will involve a lot more drones or a lot more kind of intrusion into our privacy, I mean, do you think that's another reason why, you know, Amazon may look a lot different in a few years?</p><p>PACHAL: They will, but I think it's going to be begotten by their innovation. And yes, absolutely, the thing is they're talking about drones. Well, that's all regulated by the FAA. They're even talking about -- what Bezos is anyway talking about doing something with healthcare. You know, you can sort of ambition maybe sort of there's a healthcare system that's -- you know, Amazon Prime but with healthcare.</p><p>You know this is all speculative. But, you know, there he's definitely researching it. So, there you're into the FDA and any number of government agencies. So, I certainly believe Amazon in the coming years is going to be regulated more and more, so do by virtue of where they are interested in going.</p><p>The antitrust stuff, you know, I -- it's been ongoing, you know. Like their dominance, they're -- you know, their account for something like half of all e-commerce in the country. But I mean, there's no question I think that a lot of that is simply because it's a great product, it's a great experience, it's all the things I sort of mentioned at the beginning where, you know, you get this package and you have this relationship, and then, you have this trust, and then you put microphones and cameras in your house with the ecosystems and that's a seemingly a great experience.</p><p>There may be another shoe that drops with Amazon in the way it did with Facebook. And if that does happen in the next few years, the game could change radically for them.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and I'm sure the likes of Walmart that is trying to take people like Amazon on more head-on will also have something to say about all of this in the next few years. Pete, thanks so much. Really appreciated.</p><p>PACHAL: My pleasure, Paula, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NEWTON: OK, you don't want to miss the next story soaring above everyone's heads. Flying man is the envy of everyone who watched this year's Bastille Day parade. Have a look at there. Perhaps, grabbing the attention may have a seat in someone in that White House.</p><p>[02:55:15] NEWTON: OK, so the French now have something new for the U.S. President Donald Trump to envy. Yes, last year's Bastille Day parade, you may remember inspired this year's Fourth of July celebration in Washington D.C.</p><p>Jeanne Moos reports Sunday's fly board may top any military hardware.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, up in the sky, it's a bird.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a plane.</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's the fly board guy who stole the show at the Bastille Day parade in Paris.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Faster than a speeding bullet.</p><p>MOOS: Actually the Flyboard Air's top speed is around 118 miles an hour. That's the inventor and entrepreneur, Franky Zapata operating the Flyboard.</p><p>FRANKY ZAPATA, INVENTOR, FLYBOARD AIR: We have one remote control.</p><p>MOOS: French President Emmanuel Macron watched approvingly, as fans compared it to everything from Marty McFly's Back to the Future hoverboard to that flying villain, the Green Goblin.</p><p>GREEN GOBLIN, FICTIONAL SUPERVILLAIN: Hello, my dear.</p><p>MOOS: But making the Green Goblin a reality is enough to make a certain someone green with envy. President Trump loves toys. At Monday's Made in America event, he boarded a boat and got behind the wheel of a THAAD missile defense vehicle.</p><p>Remember what happened last time he watched a French parade, he liked it so much. He said, \"I'll have what they're having.\" And on the 4th of July, we had a bevy of fly byes. But now, the French have one- upped everyone. Maybe by next 4th of July, we'll see the commander- in-chief commanding his own Flyboard.</p><p>Franky Zapata's next stunt will be to fly across the English Channel since the turbine-powered engines allow for at least 10 minutes flying time. That will require mid-flight refueling. Flyboard development got a grant from the French military though some were skeptical of its usefulness and survivability. The parade featured everything from horses to robots, and even anti-drone guns, which could probably take the fly out of a fly board as well.</p><p>By the way, that rifle was reported to be unloaded or faked. And even the French haven't figured out how to kiss through a helmet. Jeanne Moos, CNN.</p><p>TRUMP: It would be like a rocketship.</p><p>MOOS: New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: All right. That story speaks for itself. Thanks for joining us. I'm Paula Newton, I will be right back with more news. You're watching CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019071619CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKD-KV31-JB20-G531-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Diseases</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>WikiLeaks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Julian Assange</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Cup</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.C.

I'm John Vause and you are watching CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: Four progressive U.S. lawmakers are fighting back against two days of racist attacks by the U.S. president, the four Democrats, all women of color, have rejected the president's suggestion that they simply hate America and they should go back to where they came from.</p><p>They say they simply disagree with the president's policies and they're working to make the United States a better place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR, (D) MINNESOTA: He is launching a blatantly racist attack on four duly elected members of the United States of House of Representatives, all of whom are women of color. This is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms or it is happening on national TV and now it has reached the White House garden.</p><p>REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA), MAJORITY MEMBER, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM: Despite the occupant of the White House attempts to marginalize us and to silence us, please know that we are more than four people. And given the size of this squad and this great nation, we cannot, we will not be silenced.</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI), MAJORITY MEMBER, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM: Sadly, this is not the first nor will it be the last time we hear disgusting bigoted language from the president. We know this is who he is.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK: He can't look a child in the face and he can't look all Americans in the face and justify why this country is throwing them in cages. So instead, he tells us that I should go back to the great borough of the Bronx and make it better. And that's what I'm here to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And during that news conference the president was back on Twitter, here is part of what he put out there.</p><p>\"The Dems are trying to distance themselves from the four progressives but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing socialism, hate of Israel and the USA. Not good for the Democrats.\"</p><p>CNN Jim Acosta has more now reporting from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump is defending his racist attacks on Twitter, telling reporters he's not concerned that his tweets, aimed at four Democratic women of color in Congress, may appeal to white nationalists.</p><p>TRUMP: It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me and all I'm saying -- they want to leave, they can leave. Now it doesn't say leave forever. It says leave.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Referring to congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, the president tweeted that they can go back to where they came from.</p><p>But three of them were born in the U.S. The fourth, Omar, came here as a child and became a citizen. There were no apologies from Mr. Trump as he --</p><p>[00:05:00]</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): -- took his incendiary rhetoric one step further, telling the women they can leave the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. And that is what I say all the time. That is what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial. A lot of people love it, by the way. A lot of people love it. But if you're not happy in the U.S., if you're complaining all the time, very simply, can you leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want. Don't come back. It's OK, too. But if you're not happy, you can leave.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): The president also fired back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who tweeted that the slogan \"make America great again\" has always been about making America white again.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, that is just a very racist statement, somebody that would say that. So Speaker Pelosi said make America white again, let me tell you, that is a very racist -- that is a very racist statement. I'm surprised she would say that.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): But the president's race-baiting rhetoric has been a cornerstone of his rise in American politics, going back to his birther attacks on Barack Obama.</p><p>TRUMP: People are trying to figure out why isn't he giving his birth certificate. It's not a birth certificate.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): That is racist: Obama was born in Hawaii.</p><p>Then there were his comments about immigrants crossing the Mexican border as he launched his campaign.</p><p>TRUMP: They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): That is racist, too. Then there was his equivocating over white nationalists and neo-Nazis spreading violence in Charlottesville.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest --</p><p>TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. They didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis. And you had some very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Democrats say it is all part of a pattern.</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D-TX), FORMER HUD SECRETARY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Everybody knows that the president acts like a white supremacist, he is a racist, he's made that clear on so many different occasions.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Top administration officials are hardly eager to answer for the president's racist tweets.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: What I already said is I think the president clarified his comment. I understand what the president's comment is. I'm not concerned by the president's comment and, again, that is the last comment I'm going to make on this issue.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): Yet the president still has plenty of allies inside the GOP backing him up.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own country. They're anti-Semitic. They're anti-America.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ACOSTA: White House officials are more than willing to defend the president in private. A senior White House official recently told me the president was not a racist but when asked if that comment could be stated on the record, the official declined -- Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Leaders are commenting on President Trump's tweets. British prime minister Theresa May called his comments \"completely unacceptable.\" And here's Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: That is not how we do things in Canada, a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian and the diversity of our country is actually one of our greatest strengths.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Now to the U.S. economy, Wall Street will start the day at new record highs, all three indexes saw minimal games on Monday, finishing off to an all-time high. Investors will keep a close eye on the big banks and tech firms this week.</p><p>Now reports coming in from China that it had its slowest quarterly growth in at least 27 years, having little or no impact on the stock markets across the U.S.</p><p>OK, so here's a snapshot from a time long since gone and it may actually sound a bit familiar. Big tax cuts especially for the wealthiest of Americas. Easy monetary policy was fueling the U.S. economy and also the stock market as well.</p><p>It was easy to get money, it was easy to buy shares. In Washington, lawmakers had embraced this laissez-faire economy, where regulations were set aside so big businesses could grow. There was no limit essentially to what big businesses could do.</p><p>There was also very little limit to immigration. A Republican White House with a policy best described as America first, raised tariffs, claiming that would protect jobs as well as industry and when other countries responded in kind, they made the calculation that the U.S. economy was strong enough to win a trade war.</p><p>Only no one actually won the trade war because eventually the global economy, because it essentially crashed and the U.S. stock market and markets around the world quickly followed. And then came the currency wars to boost exports to countries to devalue their currencies to make their products relatively cheaper on the world markets, and then put it all together and you have this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): On October 29th, 1929, reality finally caught up with the stock market and what went up came crashing back down.</p><p>[00:10:00]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Panicked investors sold 16 million shares in a single day, many for just pennies a share.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Sure there are some differences but the echoes of the Roaring '20s are being heard as we move into 2020. On Wall Street analysts say that President Trump is going to weaken the U.S. dollar to boost the economy.</p><p>It's no secret he believes the U.S. dollar is overvalued. If it is devalued, history has taught us other nations will follow suit history and that is what is called a currency war. But when it comes to this U.S. president, history is not his strong suit.</p><p>Remember the stuff about the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Great president, most people don't even know he was a Republican, right?</p><p>Does anyone know?</p><p>A lot of people don't know that, we have to build that up a little bit more. Let's take an ad. Let's use one of those PACs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Then there was Frederick Douglass, leader of the abolitionist movement, born more than 200 years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Frederick Douglass, Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You get the idea. Global business executive Ryan Patel joins us from Los Angeles.</p><p>Ryan, good to see you.</p><p>RYAN PATEL, GLOBAL BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: Likewise, good to see you. VAUSE: Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. This is a president who admits he's not a big fan of book reading. To be fair what we've done is paint with some very broad brushstrokes here but on Monday CNN reported, it could trigger a currency war, Bank of America warning recently, we think direct foreign exchange intervention by the U.S. is a low but rising risk.</p><p>This from former Sachs strategist Michael Carlill (ph). The statement to clients and went on to say Trump's sudden trade moves have created a perception than anything is possible.</p><p>And that seems in play right now with this U.S. president, what was once considered simply unthinkable or crazy or absolutely lunatic, it's on the table now, whatever it is.</p><p>PATEL: Yes. And this is probably one of the few things where I think the administration has actually thought this through, truthfully.</p><p>How could they potentially get into the currency trade war?</p><p>And you have a feeling that with the trade war with the U.S. and China that this was something of a leverage.</p><p>Now you mentioned, could the U.S. government intervene, extreme intervention, into devaluing the dollar?</p><p>That to me, personally, is kind of highly unlikely. I don't really see him going to that.</p><p>But do I see him getting away from the strong dollar policy?</p><p>Putting rhetoric out there, that could easily cause 10 percent devaluation. We saw Bank of America saying they would prefer him doing that versus trying to get into and pushing the Fed and the Treasury to do certain things that, then, to your point, would lead to countries putting higher imports on companies here in the U.S., which that would lead to American consumers buying less.</p><p>VAUSE: For years major economies around the world have promised, there's been this sort of agreement, that they would not devalue the currencies for economic advantage. The U.S. president clearly believes that not everyone is keeping that commitment.</p><p>Earlier this month he tweeted China and Europe are playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to beat the USA. We should match or continue being the dummies, who sit back and gladly watch as other countries continue to play their games, as they have for many years.</p><p>China certainly has devalued in the past its currency but a CNN analyst noted, China is not manipulated its the currency anymore, there is no evidence that the Chinese central bank interfered with its currency.</p><p>So the White House language he went on to write has to be interpreted for a pre-election perspective. Very little in this White House is done without politics as a major factor. He's in the same boat or a different category but the president is determined to do it.</p><p>PATEL: This is definitely tying to the rhetoric, you saw the analysts, not anymore, I think most economists and global analysts are looking at how China is not doing that anymore in a way that, if Trump thought this was a big deal, he would've already brought the currency war at the forefront.</p><p>Why wait now?</p><p>To this point?</p><p>I believe this is timed -- and you and I have talked about this multiple times -- what does a trade war actually lead to?</p><p>This currency conversation that we are having is because we are in a trade war with China and the U.S. is in a trade war with others potentially, maybe France, maybe U.K. This is a tool that to me is very calculated on their part, they are showing their hands so they could go down this path again.</p><p>Not sure that the U.S. wants to do it, but this rhetoric has been going on for multiple months now, so this is not new news all of a sudden but, to your point, this is real, this is not going to go away.</p><p>VAUSE: And with regard to your history as prologue, we've seen the movie before, first come the tariffs and then you get the currency inflations, I mean, the currency wars back in the 1930s happened after the crash. It didn't cause the crash but it made the depression longer and more painful than it should be.</p><p>PATEL: Yes, and, in this case are, economy is so interconnected when interest rates --</p><p>[00:15:00]</p><p>PATEL: -- go down that could be a Band-aid.</p><p>But when you are talking about importing, we are so tied globally in a trade perspective, just think about this, if the dollar gets weaker, what happens?</p><p>Companies can go overseas and they can increase their sales, the U.S. companies, could be more competitive. However what happens when you do that and the actual countries tariff them, your prices go up. And then all of a sudden the U.S. economy, the GDP of the U.S. will go down. And now we are back to square zero.</p><p>And this is where it will hurt more than the history in the past, this is what is scary about this, this will hit much more quicker in the pockets of the American consumer.</p><p>VAUSE: I hate to think there are institutions and there are mechanisms that would resolve these kinds of issues but they are dependent on the authority of the World Bank, this administration no faith in those institutions.</p><p>This threat of a currency war seems to be a logical conclusion to the path of the Trump administration.</p><p>PATEL: If you'd asked me this two years ago and said, is this a possibility?</p><p>I would've been very honest with you, I don't think so. But seeing what happened last year and six months with the rhetoric from the Trump administration and what they've set out to do in their rhetoric, I don't know how you would think that this is not a possibility.</p><p>And I think that's what they want you to believe and I believe it because you've seen a lot of different things in the last few years that I've never seen when it comes to how you use tactics and how you ignore even diplomacy ways in the past.</p><p>VAUSE: I'll just say this, a currency war, there are shortterm winners but in the short term, everyone loses.</p><p>PATEL: Always.</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks, mate, good to see you.</p><p>PATEL: Likewise.</p><p>VAUSE: Coming up, Nepal, Bangladesh, parts of India are ravaged by flooding and landslides, millions are in the region and they are suffering and it could get a lot worse.</p><p>And Amazon workers striking on one of Amazon's biggest sales days of the year, from the United States to Germany.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: The party's over at music festival in croatia. A massive fire broke out, forcing everyone to evacuate. Large plumes of smoke just behind the main stage. Organizers say that performances are now on hold and the attendees have been escorted to a nearby town. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p><p>More than 100 people have been killed in floods and landslides which were caused by monsoon rains in nepal, Bangladesh and northeast India. Tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes. The region could see another several days with periods of heavy rain.</p><p>[00:20:00]</p><p>VAUSE: Joining us now from New Delhi, CNN's Nikhil Kumar.</p><p>These monsoon rains at one point they were late arriving and now they have arrived with a vengeance.</p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF: That's right, John, only weeks ago we were talking about heat waves affecting parts of India, parts of the subcontinent and now we are talking about these floods.</p><p>And so just within weeks, the situation has changed and as you say, this is still the beginning of these rains We expect more to come but already, John, they have caused devastation for hundreds of thousands of millions of people affected in this region in Northeast India, Bangladesh and Nepal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KUMAR (voice-over): First came the heat, killing more than 130 people across India. In Dhar (ph) state alone, more than 100 people died. The worst ever heat related death toll ever recorded.</p><p>On the other side of the country, Maharashtra state suffered its worst drought in decades. And then came the floods, just as devastating, as the climate swung like a destructive pendulum.</p><p>In the capital of Mumbai, it was hit by the heaviest rainfall in more than a decade, bringing the city to a standstill. Building walls collapsed, railway stations and highways were overrun with water.</p><p>And now, heavy downpours in Bihar and surrounding states as well as parts of neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh, have killed scores of people in recent days. Millions face devastation. Experts say the climate crisis makes such extreme swings in the weather more and more likely.</p><p>ARUNABHA GHOSH, CLIMATE EXPERT: Between the mid 1980s and the mid- 2010s, India was hit by about 300 extreme weather events. But most of those happened after 2005. So there is an increase in the intensity and the frequency of extreme weather events.</p><p>KUMAR (voice-over): Chennai, India's sixth largest city it has become a symbol of this problem. Unusually heavy rainfall in 2015 triggered widespread flooding. And this year, it has almost run out of water, following lower than usual rainfall. The city's infrastructure was simply not prepared to deal with the swings in the weather, which money warned is a nationwide problem.</p><p>GHOSH: The infrastructure's clearly not fit for purpose. So our infrastructure, whether it's in terms of storm water drains, flood defenses, protection of communities, especially the poorer communities, our transportation systems, these have to become far more resilient.</p><p>KUMAR (voice-over): Failing to do so doesn't just have an economic cost. This extreme weather places havoc with the country's infrastructure. It also puts millions more Indians in mortal danger.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KUMAR: So as you can see, we are now talking about more than 100 killed but the largest story here is really these extremes of the weather, from extreme heat to rain and flooding and the devastation it causes people. And it will not go away anytime soon, the authorities need to catch up with this. Otherwise millions more people in coming years could face devastation because of this fallout from the climate crisis -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, this is the beginning of the new normal, Nikhil Kumar, thank you for the live report.</p><p>Amazon workers in the United States and Europe are on strike during the company's biggest sales days of the year. It's called Prime Day, the workers are demanding higher wages and better conditions.</p><p>Amazon claims it offers industry leading pay and a safe work experience. President and founder of Sperry Media joins us now from Los Angeles.</p><p>Scott, thank you for coming in.</p><p>SCOTT PERRY, SPERRY MEDIA: Thanks for having me, John.</p><p>VAUSE: So these industry giants, leading wages in the United States at least $15 an hour, which means an Amazon employee who puts in a 10-hour day shift, takes no vacation or sick days, takes home $59,000 a year. According to a calculation by money.com, it takes Jeff Bezos just under 9 seconds to earn what an Amazon median worker does in a year.</p><p>Is that an egregiously incredible wealth gap or a stupid comparison because Bezos wouldn't have a job?</p><p>PERRY: It's not the right comparison. It's good that Jeff Bezos makes as much money as he does for being an innovator and Amazon is paying fair market wages for warehouse workers.</p><p>But even Jeff Bezos sent off a signal last week telling people they're launching a $700 million education initiative for their employees to get out. Even at $15 an hour, these jobs will not be around in 10 years.</p><p>All the factory workers will be replaced by robots 100 percent. So it is good that people are making what they are making now even though it is not a lot of money in the big picture.</p><p>But in due time all the humans are going to be replaced anyway with artificial intelligence and robots handling all the pick package and distribution in the warehouses.</p><p>[00:25:00]</p><p>VAUSE: So a miserable, crappy job with miserable, crappy wages isn't going to last in time to leave. So Amazon does not seem to be concerned with the industrial action and the impact on this big two- day sales event. Listen to the VP from Amazon Prime.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CEM SIBAY, VP OF AMAZON PRIME: We have a lot of redundancy in place where we have over 175 fulfillment centers globally to make sure that Prime member experiences are not disrupted during this event as well. But we take, you know, concerns of our employees, obviously very, very serious as well. But I'm really actually proud of the working conditions --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, one worker from an Amazon warehouse administrator told CNN, we're humans, not robots, they are treating us like machines.</p><p>And they will be in a short amount of time, I guess. These complaints of Amazon workers are not new, some said they can't sit down at work, bathroom breaks are timed. It is all very regimented.</p><p>This is just the economic reality, people want stuff delivered quickly and they want to don't pay much for it so this is the end result.</p><p>PERRY: If people want to point any fingers, we should look at ourselves for demanding these efficiencies in the marketplace to get our products right now because of that. People are being times. Their work conditions are monotonous and boring and hot and strenuous and you're on your feet all day.</p><p>And it is not the ideal situation for any type of a job to seek any fulfillment but it is a way to put money -- put food on the table for your children but it is not a way of life.</p><p>You know, we are trying to advance beyond that stage so hopefully these people can take advantage of these education programs to learn more about artificial intelligence and programming and data analysis and international drop shipping and other means making money through the systems.</p><p>But these labor jobs pay the bills in markets where there might not be other jobs available. The pay is double the minimum wage, there are 175 distribution centers around America and 300,000 employees in American, 500,000 around the world, 90-95 percent of which are the warehouse workers and the delivery people for Amazon.</p><p>But in time, these jobs will disappear.</p><p>VAUSE: And look I should say there is dignity in work, no matter what that work is and if you need to earn a wage and provide for yourself and your family, it is not to be laughed at.</p><p>Is there a cost here to Amazon's image, its reputation, is there enough consumers out there, a significant number, who look at this and decide I don't want to use Amazon because of the way they treat their staff and then ultimately (INAUDIBLE) the workers?</p><p>PERRY: Ultimately, not really. Yes, because of social media, the way we are all connected, we are much more aware of factory conditions than we were in the time of Upton Sinclair or Charles Dickens or anything like that.</p><p>But there has always been a dirty underbelly around most labor anyway and because of their size, there are going to be a lot more accidents, because of the number of people that they hire.</p><p>But it is not going to prevent people from tapping into the convenience of purchasing from Amazon to get things they want when they need at the price they want.</p><p>VAUSE: Just quickly, Tuesday all the big tech giants will be on the commercial hot seat on Capitol Hill in Washington, some people with Facebook, Apple, the question is should they be broken up in an antitrust case?</p><p>What are these companies being accused of doing?</p><p>Amazon undercutting the competition; Google and Facebook offering free services. Anti-trust cases are built on prices (INAUDIBLE) consumers. This is a law that is going to break up phone companies as well as Standard Oil (INAUDIBLE) 100 years ago or 50 years ago, the telephone companies.</p><p>This is (INAUDIBLE) in step with the 21st century.</p><p>PERRY: Yes, it's really bizarre because if you break up these companies, then you have that many more companies to manage but then again you have all this data in the hands of a handful of companies, whether it is Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon.</p><p>And because they own the markets that they run, it is hard for any competition to come in to provide any type of real run for their money. But it is a hard thing because as Congress showed last year, they don't have a basic understanding of how the Internet works to even understand how to govern these companies to begin with.</p><p>So I'm kind of interested to see what the outcome will be from the testimony. But there needs to be some oversight, they've all said it themselves but we have to decide what that oversight is and how that information is shared between these companies and the government and how those companies are being observed for their practices.</p><p>VAUSE: It is an interesting problem for many congresspeople to really understand what these companies are doing. PERRY: Thanks, John, appreciate it.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE (voice-over): One path for those seeking U.S. asylum has been made nearly impossible because of a new rule by the Trump administration.

But this is a legal move to potentially make that journey entirely pointless.</p><p>What the Trump administration will do on Tuesday is publish in the federal register a new rule that basically says if you travel through a country to get to the U.S.-Mexico border, well, it's in that country the Central Americans should be requesting asylum. That will also invalidate them from getting a request for asylum in the United States.</p><p>Now, I mean, that will face, obviously, legal challenges, certainly, and it may get knocked down. Or it may, certainly, slow the passage of people trying to get into the U.S.</p><p>We've heard from Mexico's foreign minister, a reaction saying this will not affect Mexicans. Well, that's entirely true. And pledging, of course, to stand up for the human rights of Mexicans if some of them are, in fact, caught in the ongoing ICE raids that are happening across the United States now. But this particular legal challenge is one of a number of things the Trump administration is trying to do to slow the passage of tens of thousands of Central Americans up through Mexico towards their border. They did try and hatch an agreement with Guatemala to declare itself a third safe country, meaning that Central Americans passing through it would actually have to apply for asylum in Guatemala entirely.</p><p>[00:35:10] And of course, they've pressured the Mexican government to send troops, the National Guard, down to the Mexican-Guatemalan border to slow the illegal flow of people across that border, as well.</p><p>But this particular legal challenge is stark, as I say. It's had human rights activists and advocates saying it will face legal challenges in the court. But they've also warned that you're essentially pushing migrants, desperate so many of them, for a better life and to escape the perils of their home countries, to much more dangerous measures.</p><p>Do they potentially have to take to the sea to get around Mexico in order to not have passed through another country and invalidate themselves for U.S. asylum. Lots of questions but increasing concerns for the fate of often whole families that try and take this particular journey and the Trump administration's clear march towards making that passage as impossible as they possibly can.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Mexico City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, Turkey has acquired a missile defense system from Russia, a deal that's making its U.S. and NATO allies very uneasy. Nic Robertson explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Each of these Russian-made missiles delivered to Turkey, another potential nail in NATO's coffin.</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): As of today, the eighth plane has arrived and has started to unload. Now our goal is to co-producing with Russia. We'll do this. We'll go even further.</p><p>ROBERTSON: NATO's response since deliveries began last week has been cautious: \"It is up two allies to decide what military equipment they buy. However, we are concerned about the potential consequences of Turkey's decision to acquire the S-400 system. Interoperability in our armed forces is fundamental to NATO for the conduct of our operations and missions.\"</p><p>These careful words may prove an understatement of the dangers the 29- nation alliance faces. Before delivery the State Department warned of repercussions.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: Turkey, as you pointed out, will receive real and negative NATO consequences if they accept the S-400.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Yet at the G-20 in Japan a week or so earlier, and despite signing legislation in 2017 mandating U.S. sanctions for anyone doing business with parts of Russia's military, Trump was sounding soft on Turkey's leader.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a complicated deal. We're working on it. We'll see what we can do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I ask you one last --</p><p>ROBERTSON: The reason the deal is so sensitive is because Turkey is also in the process of buying 100 American F-35 advanced fighter jets. And if they got both American F-35s and Russian S-400s, Turkey could hand NATO's enemies a deadly advantage.</p><p>Russia would likely be the first to benefit, giving it a backdoor boost to their arms sales, as well as creating a rift in NATO's ranks, which is what they've been trying to do for decades, believing their Soviet-era enemy NATO is spreading eastward into their backyard. Indeed the 13 newest members, all since 1999, have been Eastern European states.</p><p>At the G-20, Erdogan said he believes Trump had given Turkey a pass on sanctions.</p><p>ERDOGAN (through translator): About the sanctions, Mr. Trump already clarified the issue on his statements to the press. We heard from him that there would be no such thing.</p><p>ROBERTSON: As Trump relentlessly reminds NATO, the U.S. is the alliance's biggest payer and by far its largest player.</p><p>(on camera): For now NATO seems to be listening, holding fire on further comment until they see President Trump's next move. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he expects the president to comply with the law. What Trump does do next will signal the durability of the 70- year-old alliance.</p><p>Nic Robertson, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Soaring above everyone's head, flying man is the envy of everyone who watched this year's Bastille Day parades. He's grabbing the attention of someone in the White House.</p><p>[00:40:41] VAUSE: The French have something new for the U.S. president to envy. Last year's Bastille Day parade inspired this year's Fourth of July celebration. Jeanne Moose reports now Sunday's flyboard may top any military hardware.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look up in the sky. It's a bird!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a plane!</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's the flyboard guy who stole the show at the Bastille Day parade in Paris.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Faster than a speeding bullet.</p><p>MOOS: Actually, the Flyboard Air's top speed is around 118 miles an hour. That's the inventor and entrepreneur, Franky Zapata, operating the fly board.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have one remote control.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron watched approvingly as fans compared it to everything from Marty McFly's \"Back to the Future\" hover board to that flying villain, the Green Goblin.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, my dear.</p><p>MOOS (on camera): But making the Green Goblin a reality is enough to make a certain someone green with envy.</p><p>(voice-over): President Trump loves toys. At Monday's \"Made in America\" event, he boarded a boat and got behind the wheel of a fab missile defense vehicle.</p><p>Remember what happened last time he watched a French parade? He liked it so much he said, \"I'll have what they're having.\" And on the Fourth of July, we had a bevy of fly-bys.</p><p>But now the French have one-upped everyone. Maybe by next Fourth of July we'll see the commander-in-chief commanding his own fly board.</p><p>Franky Zapata's next stunt will be to fly across the English Channel, since the turbine-powered engines allow for at least ten minutes' flying time. That will require mid-flight refueling. Flyboard development got a grant from the French military, though some were skeptical of its usefulness and survivability.</p><p>The parade featured everything from horses to robots and even anti- drone guns, which could probably take the fly out of a fly board, as well.</p><p>By the way, that rifle was reported to be unloaded or fake, and even the French haven't figured out how to kiss through a helmet.</p><p>Jeanne Moos, CNN --</p><p>TRUMP: It would be like a rocket ship.</p><p>MOOS: -- New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Before we go, for the past few days, the U.S. president has been blunt in his criticism of four elected members of Congress, because they disagree with his policies and because they've criticized him and his administration for an immigration policy they see as cruel and vindictive.</p><p>The president, who's notoriously thin-skinned, has seen that as un- American, even treasonous, so has made it clear these women, three born in the U.S., the other naturalized two decades ago, are something less, less than the Trump family, perhaps, who emigrated from Germany two generations ago.</p><p>Here's a reminder from the legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow of the values and ideals of the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDWARD R. MURROW, JOURNALIST: We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof, and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law.</p><p>We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine. And remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate, and to defend the causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM.

Secure and ubiquitous, smartphones discreetly and automatically alert those who have been exposed to coronavirus and suggest they self-isolate. Human ingenuity triumphs and the spread of the deadly virus is slowed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital contact tracing also promises a redemption story for Big Tech, too. In its pursuit of advertising dollars, Silicon Valley has invested in location surveillance. Now it gets the chance to put it to good use. Earlier this month, rivals Google and Apple teamed up to develop technical standards for accessing smartphone location data in a way that's useful for tracking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">App enthusiast Matt Hancock - who two years ago announced his promotion to culture secretary by becoming the first government minister with his own social network - clearly hopes so, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The NHS confirmed last week it will follow in the footsteps of coronavirus tracking trailblazers such as Singapore and Israel to roll out smartphone software to detect who has been in contact with whom.</p><p>NHSX, the health service's in-house digital team, is leading the work for Hancock. Gaining public trust throws up the first set of obstacles.</p><p>Documents seen by The Sunday Telegraph indicate the National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ, is being consulted closely.</p><p>The technology envisaged would detect when two smartphone owners are within two metres and check their status against a database of Covid-19 carriers. If either party triggers an alert, the other would get a warning and possibly a quarantine order, too.</p><p>The appeal of such a miracle app is enormous. Such a system might allow Hancock and NHS bosses to keep the rate of infection sufficiently low to allow Britain to get back to work.</p><p>\"All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research,\" Hancock says.</p><p>He has academic back-up. \"People have no idea who you have infected. Either you can lock everybody up and engage in social distancing, or get smart and find individuals who are at risk of transmission,\" says Dr David Bonsall of Oxford's Big Data Institute, which is advocating strongly for the technology. The Institute's modellers found that speed was essential to halting the spread of the disease and estimate the approach will be effective if 60pc of the population use the app.</p><p>Singapore's experience suggests that may be a formidable challenge. Even with its obedient culture, it is estimated the contract-tracing app TraceTogether has been downloaded by less than one in five.</p><p>Yet even if tens of millions of Britons can be convinced to install a surveillance app, expert engineers and academics have warned of profound problems. They fear the system won't be able to do what Hancock and his bullish team of data modellers claim.</p><p>Health professionals fear a blizzard of false warnings - a criticism levelled by users of Israel's app HaMagen - could make things worse and risk permanent damage to public goodwill.</p><p>The problem hardware engineers warn, is the integrity of the data on that the system would be based. Smartphones have four sources of data to help determine their location, and all have accuracy problems.</p><p>The civilian version of GPS only gives a four-metre resolution and is easily interfered with by buildings. Smartphones also use databases of Wi-Fi routers to work out where they are, but their accuracy is even worse. FON, which maintains a global database of hotspots, only claims accuracy of around 20 metres. Data from connecting to mobile masts is also less accurate than GPS, and even worse in the countryside.</p><p>NHSX has chosen to focus, instead, on the final source: the short-range wireless technology Bluetooth, which a panoply of digital devices use to talk to each other. On paper Bluetooth is promising. Fixed Bluetooth \"beacons\" in shops are already advanced enough to provide accurate location data used by retailers to track how customers move through the aisles. However, such retail beacons don't themselves move. Using a Bluetooth link between two moving targets is a big challenge.</p><p>Dr Jaap Haartsen, the inventor of Bluetooth, told a Dutch paper last week that it is too unreliable and inaccurate to be used for contact tracing and risks generating lots of false alarms. \"Work is under way to improve this, but won't be ready in time for this pandemic,\" he said.</p><p>Ross Anderson, a Cambridge professor, suggests how false positives threaten to undermine the data, too. The passengers of two buses next to each other at traffic lights might appear to have been in contact as Bluetooth would not detect the separation between them. People may be given a bogus instruction to isolate.</p><p>Nuffield's Ada Lovelace Institute last week produced a damning summary of the exuberance around digital contact tracing. \"Inaccurate, irresponsible or imprecise use of data can undermine public health strategies,\" wrote the authors. \"[They] exacerbate the spread of the pandemic or erode public trust and confidence in government.\"</p><p>Diverting resources to the technology \"may undermine the pandemic response\", the Ada Lovelace Institute warned.</p><p>Director Carly Kind suggests Britons may not adopt a contact tracing app with even the limited enthusiasm of Singaporeans. She notes that a supportive paper from Oxford's Big Data Institute was co-authored by staff from the NHS contractor Faculty - which is helping NHSX write the app - and questions its independence.</p><p>Faculty was co-founded by Marc Warner, the chief executive, whose brother Ben was recently recruited to advise the Government on data science. Ben previously modelled the Vote Leave campaign and the Tories' 2019 election campaign.</p><p>David Bonsall, of the Oxford Big Data Institute, rejects suggestions of a lack of independence and says that, while \"Faculty are working with NHSX and we're all talking to each other\" the paper is \"absolutely not pushing\" the contact tracing project.</p><p>The idea of using Bluetooth to fight a pandemic is not new and has support from serious computer scientists. Almost a decade ago Cambridge University's Prof Jon Crowcroft used the technology for the FluPhone experiment, which explored the feasibility of tracing an infectious virus. He says he was able to calibrate the system to an accuracy of around one metre, using less sophisticated tech than we have today.</p><p>Both Crowcroft and Bonsall argue there's value if we define a \"contact\" not as a brief encounter, but as a prolonged meeting, of say 15 minutes.</p><p>\"We're not proposing a magic bullet.</p><p>It's about integrating it with all the other interventions, including manual contact tracing,\" Bonsall adds.</p><p>Yet Bluetooth engineering experts remain sceptical. Many enthusiasts for contact tracing were convinced that problems could be overcome by a German experiment that placed soldiers on a kind of human chessboard. It tested whether Bluetooth signal is a reasonable proxy for proximity. They concluded it could be - but testers' phones were never kept in pockets. The real world may be very different, sceptics argue.</p><p>Elon Musk's biographer Ashlee Vance, a historian of Silicon Valley, says: \"We've been told for years that influenza can be detected from people's search queries, and heart attacks predicted by our smart watches. Yet here we are in the middle of a crisis, and the Silicon Valley brain trust has few insights to offer. It makes you wonder if having the world's top engineers spend a decade fine-tuning advertising algorithms was the right use of our time and resources.\"</p><p>The risk for Hancock - and perhaps the public at large - is that while you can live by the app, if you get it wrong you can die by it, too.</p><p>Andrew Orlowski is research director of Think of X Privacy perils Europe grapples with Big Brother In early March it looked like the European technology community had made a rare show of unity. Over one hundred technology and telecoms companies, NGOs and academic institutions, rallied around an initiative called PEPP-PT (Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing) to address privacy concerns over digital contact tracing.</p><p>\"The anonymity of data is the biggest concern,\" says one medical privacy expert. Without trust, no app will gain enough users to make it useful.</p><p>But since then the initiative has fallen apart in acrimony, over a familiar issue to EU watchers: the centralisation of data. \"Germany refused to present a decentralised version to their regulators,\" Prof Michael Veale of UCL Law, says. Others expressed concerns over the agenda of the initiative's founder, Hans-Christian Boos, a self-styled \"thought leader\" entrepreneur and a tech adviser to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.</p><p>The German, Italian and French governments remain committed to the PEPP-PT, but many of PEPPPT's initial supporters have decamped to a rival developed by academics, DPT-3T, which proponents argue offers greater privacy.</p><p>1 Technology Newsletter Sign up for your daily technology update <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk\">www.telegraph.co.uk</url>/ technewsletter</p><p>'Inaccurate, irresponsible or imprecise use of data can undermine public health strategies.

There\u2019s a strong correlation between the companies which have the most valuable brands and those which are the most profitable and enjoy the highest market capitalisation. Indeed, the firms behind the report, WPP and Kantar Millward Brown, claim that their proprietary brand value metric has proven to be a reliable predictor of success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market value of the Brandz Strong Brandz Portfolio, a subset of the top 100 list comprising essentially the best-of-the-best, has risen by 124.9 per cent over the past 12 years. The authors point out that this is a better performance than the S&amp;P 500 (up 82.1 per cent) or the MSCI World Index (a gain of 34.9 per cent) during the same period.</p><p>The value of the top 100 in 2017 is 152 per cent higher than the top 100 back in 2006. Writing the foreword to the report, WPP\u2019s David Roth said these results illustrate that \u201calthough market volatility is inevitable, the impact on brands is not\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThis data reveals the power of brand in the mind of the consumer to create a disposition to buy and, most importantly, validates a positive correlation with sales performance,\u201d he said.</p><p>The 2017 list, as one might expect, is dominated by Big Tech. The top six alone account for almost a third of the $3.2 trillion total value of the 100 constituent brands. Google remains just ahead of Apple at the summit and the pair are joined in the top five by Facebook and Microsoft. As the list includes Amazon in the \u201cretail\u201d sector rather than technology, it\u2019s not technically a clean sweep of the top five positions by the tech sector, but it\u2019s as close as makes no difference.</p><p>The report is now in its 12th year. While both Google and Microsoft were among the top ten (Microsoft was number one) when the first list was published in 2006, Apple was just 29th and Facebook didn\u2019t even make the cut.</p><p>The amount of brand value created in that time is phenomenal. Google\u2019s brand was originally valued at $37.4 billion. At $245 billion, it\u2019s now considered more valuable than the top five brands in 2006 combined.</p><p>The 2017 list, as one might expect, is dominated by Big Tech</p><p>But if the Brandz list tells us how quickly the disrupters have been able to establish dominance and capture consumer hearts, minds and wallets, it also tells the tale of how rapidly brand value can be destroyed.</p><p>One notable feature of the way things were back then is the prominence of financial services brands. The big Wall Street banks, in particular, were a conspicuous presence. Citibank was ninth and Bank of America occupied the 12th spot.</p><p>In 2006, Citi alone was worth $31 billion. The Citi and Bank of America brands combined are now worth less than $30 billion, according to Brandz. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have all dropped out of the top 100, replaced by a handful of Chinese banks such as ICBC. Reputational damage done in the wake of the financial crisis hasn\u2019t hit the sector across the board, however.</p><p>HSBC and JPMorgan are both present on this year\u2019s list and have enhanced the value of their brands since the 2006 report despite their frequent tangles with regulators, multibillion-euro fines and legal settlements.</p><p>The most valuable bank brand in the world is held to be San Francisco-based Wells Fargo at $58.4 billion. That figure hasn\u2019t changed since last year. That\u2019s a good result in the circumstances. In 2016, it emerged that Wells Fargo staff had created millions of fake bank accounts without customer consent. It agreed a $142 million settlement, though it is still facing a large class-action lawsuit and became the largest bank ever to be stripped of accreditation from the US Better Business Bureau.</p><p>The value arrived at by Brandz for its list combines the available financial information with a massive volume of qualitative research combining information held by WPP on 3 million consumers. Kantar Millward Brown combs through it to derive a number which reflects how those consumers feel about 120,000 separate brands.</p><p>So it reflects not just the figures published by the companies behind each brand, but how consumers feel about those brands and whether they are more, or less, inclined from year to year to buy their products.</p><p>By this measure, some brands seem impervious to what might appear to the untrained eye to be serious reputational (not to mention financial) hits. Or it might just be that, like the stock market indices it has outperformed over the past dozen years, it can suffer occasionally from unrealistic valuations \u2013 and that past performance is not necessarily a guide to future success.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUBUPO-390270</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUBUPO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55G2-YYK1-JCW9-22DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315448</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Post Publications Ltd.

While there has long-been variety in what we call conservatism in the United States, the most prominent strains have agreed on at least the following: Constitutionally limited government, free markets, and prudence in policy-making. You would think all of these values would be important in the Section 230 debate. It seems, however, that some are willing to throw these principles away in pursuit of a temporary political victory over perceived 'Big Tech censorship.' Constitutionally Limited Government: Congress Shall Make No Law The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states: 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.' </p><p>Originalists on the Supreme Court have noted[2] that this makes clear that the Constitution protects against state action, not private action. In other words, the Constitution protects a negative conception of free speech, not a positive conception[3].Despite this, some conservatives believe that Section 230 should be about promoting First Amendment values by mandating private entities are held to the same standards as the government.For instance, in his Big Tech and the Whole First Amendment[4], Craig Parshall of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) stated:What better example of objective free speech standards could we have than those First Amendment principles decided by justices appointed by an elected president and confirmed by elected members of the Senate, applying the ideals laid down by our Founders? I will take those over the preferences of brilliant computer engineers any day.In other words, he thinks Section 230 should be amended to only give Big Tech the 'subsidy' of immunity if it commits to a First Amendment-like editorial regime. To defend the constitutionality of such 'restrictions on Big Tech', he points to the Turner intermediate scrutiny standard, in which the Supreme Court upheld must-carry provisions against cable networks. In particular, Parshall latches on to the 'bottleneck monopoly' language from the case to argue that Big Tech is similarly situated to cable providers at the time of the case.Turner, however, turned more on the 'special characteristics of the cable medium' that gave it the bottleneck power than the market power itself. As stated by the Supreme Court:When an individual subscribes to cable, the physical connection between the television set and the cable network gives the cable operator bottleneck, or gatekeeper, control over most (if not all) of the television programming that is channeled into the subscriber's home. Hence, simply by virtue of its ownership of the essential pathway for cable speech, a cable operator can prevent its subscribers from obtaining access to programming it chooses to exclude. A cable operator, unlike speakers in other media, can thus silence the voice of competing speakers with a mere flick of the switch.Turner v. FCC[5], 512 U.S. 622, 656 (1994).None of the Big Tech companies has the comparable ability to silence competing speakers with a flick of the switch. In fact, the relationship goes the other way on the Internet. Users can (and do) use multiple Big Tech companies' services, as well as those of competitors which are not quite as big. Users are the ones who can switch with a click or a swipe. There is no basis for treating Big Tech companies any differently than other First Amendment speakers.Like newspapers[6], Big Tech companies must use their editorial discretion to determine what is displayed and where. Just like those newspapers[7], Big Tech has the First Amendment right to editorial discretion[8]. This, not Section 230, is the bedrock law that gives Big Tech companies the right to remove content.Thus, when Rachel Bovard of the Internet Accountability Project argues[9] that the FCC should remove the ability of tech platforms to engage in viewpoint discrimination, she makes a serious error in arguing it is Section 230 that gives them the right to remove content.Immediately upon noting that the NTIA petition seeks clarification on the relationship between (c)(1) and (c)(2), Bovard moves right to concern over the removal of content. 'Unfortunately, embedded in that section [(c)(2)] is a catch-all phrase, 'otherwise objectionable,' that gives tech platforms discretion to censor anything that they deem 'otherwise objectionable.' Such broad language lends itself in practice to arbitrariness.'In order for CDA 230 to 'give[] tech platforms discretion to censor,' they would have to not have that discretion absent CDA 230. Bovard totally misses the point of the First Amendment argument, stating:Yet DC's tech establishment frequently rejects this argument, choosing instead to focus on the First Amendment right of corporations to suppress whatever content they so choose, never acknowledging that these choices, when made at scale, have enormous ramifications. . . .But this argument intentionally sidesteps the fact that Sec. 230 is not required by the First Amendment, and that its application to tech platforms privileges their First Amendment behavior in a unique way among other kinds of media corporations. Newspapers also have a First Amendment right to publish what they choose\u2014but they are subject to defamation and libel laws for content they write, or merely publish. Media companies also make First Amendment decisions subject to a thicket of laws and regulations that do not similarly encumber tech platforms.There is the merest kernel of truth in the lines quoted above. Newspapers are indeed subject to defamation and libel laws for what they publish. But, as should be obvious, liability for publication entails actually publishing something. And what some conservatives are concerned about is platforms' ability to not publish something: to take down conservative content.It might be simpler if the First Amendment treated published speech and unpublished speech the same way. But it doesn't. One can be liable for what one speaks, writes, or publishes on behalf of others. Indeed, even with the full protection of the First Amendment, there is no question that newspapers can be held responsible for delicts caused by content they publish. But no newspaper has ever been held responsible for anything they didn't publish. Free Markets: Competition as the Bulwark Against Abuses, not Regulation Conservatives have long believed in the importance of property rights, exchange, and the power of the free market to promote economic growth. Competition is seen as the protector of the consumer, not big government regulators. In the latter half of the twentieth century into the twenty-first century, conservatives have fought for capitalism over socialism, free markets over regulation, and competition over cronyism. But in the name of combating anti-conservative bias online, they are willing to throw these principles away.The bedrock belief in the right of property owners to decide the terms of how they want to engage with others is fundamental to American conservatism. As stated by none other than Bovard (along with co-author Jim Demint in their book Conservative: Knowing What to Keep[10]):Capitalism is nothing more or less than the extension of individual freedom from the political and cultural realms to the economy. Just as government isn't supposed to tell you how to pray, or what to think, or what sports teams to follow or books to read, it's not supposed to tell you what to do with your own money and property.Conservatives normally believe that it is the free choices of consumers and producers in the marketplace that maximize consumer welfare, rather than the choices of politicians and bureaucrats. Competition, in other words, is what protects us from abuses in the marketplace. Again as Bovard and Demint rightly put it:Under the free enterprise system, money is not redistributed by a central government bureau. It goes wherever people see value. Those who create value are rewarded which then signals to the rest of the economy to up their game. It's continuous democracy.To get around this, both Parshall and Bovard make much of the 'market dominance' of tech platforms. The essays take the position that tech platforms have nearly unassailable monopoly power which makes them unaccountable. Bovard claims that 'mega-corporations have as much power as the government itself\u2014and in some ways, more power, because theirs is unchecked and unaccountable.' Parshall even connects this to antitrust law, stating: This brings us to another kind of innovation, one that's hidden from the public view. It has to do with how Big Tech companies use both algorithms plus human review during content moderation. This review process has resulted in the targeting, suppression, or down-ranking of primarily conservative content. As such, this process, should it continue, should be considered a kind of suppressive 'innovation' in a quasi-antitrust analysis.How the process harms 'consumer welfare' is obvious. A more competitive market could produce social media platforms designing more innovational content moderation systems that honor traditional free speech and First Amendment norms while still offering features and connectivity akin to the huge players.Antitrust law, in theory, would be a good way to handle issues of market power and consumer harm that results from non-price effects. But it is difficult to see how antitrust could handle the issue of political bias[11] well:Just as with privacy and other product qualities, the analysis becomes increasingly complex first when tradeoffs between price and quality are introduced, and then even more so when tradeoffs between what different consumer groups perceive as quality is added. In fact, it is more complex than privacy. All but the most exhibitionistic would prefer more to less privacy, all other things being equal. But with political media consumption, most would prefer to have more of what they want to read available, even if it comes at the expense of what others may want. There is no easy way to understand what consumer welfare means in a situation where one group's preferences need to come at the expense of another's in moderation decisions.Neither antitrust nor quasi-antitrust regimes are well-suited to dealing with the perceived harm of anti-conservative bias. However unfulfilling this is to some conservatives, competition and choice are better answers to perceived political bias than the heavy hand of government. Prudence: Awareness of Unintended Consequences Another bedrock principle of conservatism is to be aware of unintended consequences when making changes to long-standing laws and policies. In regulatory matters, cost-benefit analysis is employed to evaluate whether policies are improving societal outcomes. Using economic thinking to understand the likely responses to changes in regulation is fundamental to American conservatism. Or as Bovard and Demint's book title suggests, conservatism is about knowing what to keep.Bovard has argued that since conservatism is a set of principles, not a dogmatic ideology, it can be in favor of fighting against the collectivism of Big Tech[12] companies imposing their political vision upon the world. Conservatism, in this Kirkian sense, doesn't require particular policy solutions. But this analysis misses what has worked about Section 230 and how the very tech platforms she decries have greatly benefited society[13]. Prudence means understanding what has worked and only changing what has worked in a way that will improve upon it.The benefits of Section 230 immunity in promoting platforms for third-party speech are clear. It is not an overstatement to say that Section 230 contains 'The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet.[14]' It is important to note that Section 230 is not only available to Big Tech companies. It is available to all online platforms who host third-party speech. Any reform efforts at Section 230 must know what to keep.In a sense, Section (c)(1) of Section 230 does, indeed, provide greater protection for published content online than the First Amendment on its own would offer: it extends the First Amendment's permissible scope of published content for which an online service cannot be held liable to include otherwise actionable third-party content.But let's be clear about the extent of this protection. It doesn't protect anything a platform itself publishes, or even anything in which it has a significant hand in producing. Why don't offline newspapers enjoy this 'handout' (though the online versions clearly do for comments)? Because they don't need it, and because \u2014 yes, it's true \u2014 it comes at a cost. How much third-party content would newspapers publish without significant input from the paper itself if only they were freed from the risk of liability for such content? None? Not much? The New York Times didn't build and sustain its reputation on the slapdash publication of unedited ramblings by random commentators. But what about classifieds? Sure. There would be more classified ads, presumably. More to the point, newspapers would exert far less oversight over the classified ads, saving themselves the expense of moderating this one, small corner of their output.There is a cost to traditional newspapers from being denied the extended protections of Section 230. But the effect is less third-party content in parts of the paper that they didn't wish to have the same level of editorial control. If Section 230 is a 'subsidy' as critics put it, then what it is subsidizing is the hosting of third-party speech.The Internet would look vastly different if it was just the online reproduction of the offline world. If tech platforms were responsible for all third-party speech to the degree that newspapers are for op-eds, then they would likely moderate it to the same degree, making sure there is nothing which could expose them to liability before publishing. This means there would be far less third-party speech on the Internet.In fact, it could be argued that it is smaller platforms who would be most affected by the repeal of Section 230 immunity. Without it, it is likely that only the biggest tech platforms would have the necessary resources to dedicate to content moderation in order to avoid liability.Proposed Section 230 reforms will likely have unintended consequences in reducing third-party speech altogether, including conservative speech. For instance, a few bills have proposed[15] only allowing moderation for reasons defined by statute if the platform has an 'objectively reasonable belief' that the speech fits under such categories. This would likely open up tech platforms to lawsuits over the meaning of 'objectively reasonable belief' that could deter them from wanting to host third-party speech altogether. Similarly, lawsuits for 'selective enforcement' of a tech platform's terms of service could lead them to either host less speech or change their terms of service.This could actually exacerbate the issue of political bias[16]. Allegedly anti-conservative tech platforms could respond to a 'good faith' requirement in enforcing its terms of service by becoming explicitly biased. If the terms of service of a tech platform state grounds which would exclude conservative speech, a requirement of 'good faith' enforcement of those terms of service will do nothing to prevent the bias. Conclusion Conservatives would do well to return to their first principles in the Section 230 debate. The Constitution's First Amendment, respect for free markets and property rights, and appreciation for unintended consequences in changing tech platform incentives all caution against the current proposals to condition Section 230 immunity on platforms giving up editorial discretion. Whether or not tech platforms engage in anti-conservative bias, there's nothing conservative about abdicating these principles for the sake of political expediency. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20Principleshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20Principleshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20Principleshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;title=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20PrinciplesThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20Principleshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20Principleshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20Principleshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F30%2Fconservatism-and-the-section-230-debate-applying-first-principles%2F&amp;#38;title=Conservatism%20and%20the%20Section%20230%20Debate%3A%20Applying%20First%20PrinciplesThe</url> post Conservatism and the Section 230 Debate: Applying First Principles[17] appeared first on Truth on the Market[18].

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics - never mind political philosophy - isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p>Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism - what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p>There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p>Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans'willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p>There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals - mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic - believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p>First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship.</p><p>Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p>Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are antileft and those who are antistate.</p><p>For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids'heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p>Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p>Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\" If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p>This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do? At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work.</p><p>It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer.</p><p>And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p>Jonah Goldberg is editor-inchief of The Dispatch and the host of The Remnant podcast.</p><p>@JonahDispatch !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Sun Media Corporation.

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics - never mind political philosophy - isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p>Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism - what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p>There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p>Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans'willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p>There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals - mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic - believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p>First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship.</p><p>Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p>Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are antileft and those who are antistate.</p><p>For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids'heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p>Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p>Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\" If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p>This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do? At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work.</p><p>It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer.</p><p>And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p>Jonah Goldberg is editor-inchief of The Dispatch and the host of The Remnant podcast.</p><p>@JonahDispatch !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Sun Media Corporation.

By Wednesday, when <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>sat before the House, that accusation had gone viral on the right-wing Internet. At least four members of the House asked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>about them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'd like to show you right now a little picture here. You recognize these folks?\" <person><nameText>Rep.

Trump?\"</p><p>\"Well, Congressman, nothing is unsafe about that,\" <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said. He added that he'd probably know more about what happened if he wasn't preparing for a hearing on privacy.</p><p>Diamond and Silk came up again and again in the hearings. On Tuesday, <person><nameText>Sen. Ted Cruz </nameText></person>(R-Tex.) used their complaint as an example of \"a\u00a0pervasive pattern of political bias.\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.)\u00a0finished her time\u00a0by telling <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>that \"Diamond and Silk is not terrorism.\" Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) called them \"Silk and Diamond,\" before moving on to larger accusations about conservative bias at Facebook.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) read a question from a constituent: \"Please ask Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk? Facebook called them 'unsafe to the community.' That is ludicrous. They hold conservative views. That isn't unsafe.\"</p><p>In response to that question, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said the Facebook team \"made an enforcement error.\"</p><p>Diamond and Silk, already regular commentators on Fox News, were having a moment.

Thanks @tedcruzbecause many of your colleagues don't know much about the Interweb!</p><p>- Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) April 10, 2018</p><p>Diamond and Silk say someone at Facebook sent them a message\u00a0that said, \"The Policy team has came to the conclusion that your content and your brand has been determined unsafe to the community,\" which is where they first got the idea that there was bias against them. In a statement sent\u00a0to The Washington Post\u00a0Tuesday, Facebook spokeswoman\u00a0Sarah Pollack\u00a0said that the message was \"inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community,\" and that Facebook had already reached out to them with more information.</p><p>The pair first accused Facebook of wrongdoing on Friday night, in a post on Facebook to their 1.4 million followers. The post has more than 100,000 likes and 60,000 shares. Essentially, Diamond and Silk\u00a0accused the platform of hiding notifications to their followers, and showing their Facebook posts to fewer people, limiting their reach. They wrote that they spent months trying to get Facebook to explain what happened, until they received the email calling them \"unsafe.\"</p><p>Some of\u00a0what they experienced could be\u00a0accounted for by a broader series of changes to Facebook's algorithms that have reduced engagement for publishers across the entire platform.\u00a0Zuckerberg's admission of an \"enforcement error\"\u00a0also seems to strongly suggest that\u00a0something happened to their account, specifically.</p><p>But the bigger accusation - that is,\u00a0that Diamond and Silk were targeted\u00a0because of their political beliefs - doesn't have to be bulletproof to be viral: It comes in the context of a broader belief among many right-leaning online communities that there's a conspiracy among big Silicon Valley companies to censor their views. This idea stretches back years. And when a figure emerges whose experience seems to prove that accusation, that person becomes a right-wing folk hero.</p><p>In August, James Damore was fired from Google for writing a memo that, the company said, perpetuated \"gender stereotypes.\" What happened to him was, from the perspective of the right-wing Internet, a fulfilled prophecy, something they expect a company like Google to do to conservatives. And when a Damore or a Diamond and Silk cross over into the mainstream, it becomes an opportunity to evangelize.</p><p>Damore's firing - and then, tech companies' crackdown on hate speech following the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville later that month - launched a surprising movement among right-wing tech leaders to regulate companies like Facebook, which they believe are too biased against conservatives to properly moderate content on their own. This, and not Cambridge Analytica, has been the reason many conservatives wanted <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in the hot seat.</p><p>          More reading:\u00a0       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-687707da2dd84d099dad43c684f0c631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S33-R3S1-JB4M-V2GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"929\"/><timeReceived>8:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Don't forget, you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter @seanhannity, and we'll never be the Fake News Media Mob. Let not your heart be troubled. She is ramped up ready to go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Laura?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, let me just say this--</p><p>HANNITY: What's going on?</p><p>INGRAHAM: They are freaking out because the heat is being turned up on the old Obama DoJ, don't you feel it? You feel that they're getting a little close to the answers here, and so you got to really smear Barr, I'm going to get into that tonight.</p><p>HANNITY: Let me - can I say one thing? You know what kills a lot of these people? Because they're so lazy, overpaid and they don't even pick up a phone - like in the case of Nicholas Sandmann.</p><p>It's got to be killing them that a bunch of people that say that they are hosts - in other words, opinion people, in other words - well, I'm a talk show host, we did the work, they were too lazy to do. It wasn't that hard to kind of make a phone call, make some contacts, have sources. You do investigative journalism, don't we Laura?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, I think, when you have people like John Solomon, Sara Carter, Sol Wisenberg, people who have real expertise, I'll go to that well any day.</p><p>HANNITY: And you have a law degree and you went to Dartmouth.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, don't hold that against me. Everyone in town has a law degree. That doesn't mean much. But more importantly, I think the American people want actual facts in front of them, on what happened, how this happened, how it unfolded and then we got to address the problems facing the country today. Sean another great.</p><p>HANNITY: Have a great show. And your legal background is amazing. You should be so proud of that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, thanks so much, Sean. I really appreciate it. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE tonight from Washington. Another rough day for their President and Bill Barr derangement clubs, it turns out that the term spying - well, it was appropriate. We're going to explain in just a moment.</p><p>Plus when the New York Times broke a story about the Biden family scandalous ties to Ukraine, the Obama team blamed conservative investigator Peter Schweizer. Well, guess, what he's here to respond to charges.</p><p>And also tonight Congresswoman Ilhan Omar with another anti-American statement, you won't believe this one, blaming America for the current unrest in Venezuela. It couldn't be the fault of Socialism, right? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is here to respond.</p><p>But first, stunts and noise versus substance and poise, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Over the past 24 hours, social media, a lot of you - you were blowing up with expressions of conservative outrage over the Democrats' treatment of Attorney General Bill Barr.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I think history will judge you harshly. That conclusion is inescapable.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think you've made it clear that you have not looked at the evidence - we can move on.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: I've seen a lot of--</p><p>HARRIS: I think you've made it clear sir that you have not looked at the evidence and we can move on</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That you've not only put your own credibility into question but seem to be giving sanction to behavior through the language you used in that press conference you held.</p><p>SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): You lied and now we know.</p><p>Attorney General of the United States is a sacred trust. You have betrayed that trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Of course, it's all disgusting. It's incredibly nasty and it's patently unfair. But why would anyone be shocked now given that these same Democrats - what they did last September to another Trump pick, who also had a stellar legal career.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS: Are you willing to ask the White House to conduct an investigation by the FBI.</p><p>BARR: The FBI would gather witness statements. You have the witness - they don't --</p><p>HARRIS: I don't want to debate with you how they do their business.</p><p>BOOKER: She's not part of the Clinton's efforts to get some kind of revenge. She is a woman who came here with corroborating evidence to tell her truth.</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: Is that a question?</p><p>BOOKER: No, sir, it was a final statement.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: I was obsessed with - basketball player.</p><p>HIRONO: So you only have 23 seconds. So you are not as sloppy drunk and so your roommate was lying.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now remember Ms. Blasey Ford's decades-old allegations, they came to light only after some anonymous Committee Democrat leaked her letter leading, Blasey Ford, herself to reveal her identity to the Washington Post.</p><p>Well similarly on Tuesday, right before bars testimony, the Mueller letter was leaked to of course The Washington Post - stay with me here. Now the bottom line is, when the Democrats cannot win on the merits, on the substance, what do they do, they want to end the debate, go right for the jugular.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I strongly believe Judge Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration and the President should withdraw this nomination if Kavanaugh won't do it voluntarily.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I joined leader - Schumer and calling for Judge Kavanaugh to withdraw his name from consideration.</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I think the nomination should be withdrawn.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Of course, Kavanaugh remained defiant, and he refused to back down to those Democrats and now he has a lifetime tenure on the Supreme Court. The Democrats crashed and burned on Kavanaugh.</p><p>But not only did their stunts flop, their stunts actors were actually frauds and criminals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL AVENATTI, ATTORNEY FOR JULIE SWETNICK: A lot of this would be substantiated if there was an investigation, which is what we want. We're not - we are not laying out all of the facts and all the evidence right now, that's not our obligation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley referred Avenatti and Swetnick last week to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation.</p><p>NICK HANNA, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY: If convicted of the 36 crimes alleged in the indictment, Mr. Avenatti will face a statutory maximum sentence of 333 years in federal prison.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Avenatti was practically co-hosting shows on CNN, wasn't he? But seven months later here we are, and Democrats facing another brilliant legal mind, with impeccable credentials. They went back to the prop closet once again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions. He was afraid of Barry Burke, he was afraid of Norm Eisen. A Attorney General who's picked for his legal acumen and his abilities would not be fearful of any other attorneys questioning him for 30 minutes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Does he sleep with that chicken? I didn't know it was pronounced acumen, I guess, I'm wrong. Well the real chickens are the Democrats who are too afraid to admit that they got it all wrong on Russian collusion.</p><p>And know what else, they're too afraid to actually advance an agenda to defend whatever policies they want to forward now in the midst of a roaring Trump economy, that's actually hard stuff. So what do they do, they just revert to their same old sleazy tactics, which we have exposed by the way and documented for all of you.</p><p>No glee, but we've had to document it, because it's really important night after night, week after week on this show. And just like with Kavanaugh they're now calling for someone else's head on a platter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I think that Attorney General William Barr ought to recognize that he has an obligation to resign.</p><p>BOOKER: He's burned through any credibility he had in that role and he should resign.</p><p>HARRIS: I think he should resign and I think that he has made it very clear that, one, he hasn't - he is not able to perform his duties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Remember by the way, that both Kavanaugh and Barr are Bush Republicans, so when you think it's just all about Trump, so anyone who's connected to this administration. This always shifts to Trump, doesn't it? If you (inaudible) to name, they're going to go after you.</p><p>But my prediction the more Barr learns about who and what we're behind the 2016 efforts to smear Trump as some type of Russian collaborator, the nastier and more desperate the Democrats attacks on Barr will become.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR: I don't want to be too specific. I talked to Mike Horowitz a few weeks ago about it and it's focused on the FISA - the basis for the FISA and the handling of the FISA applications. But by necessity, it looks back a little bit earlier than that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Hmm, there must be a lot of Obama Democrats in and out of the Deep State who are sweating now.</p><p>They need Barr's reputation to be tarnished. That way whatever Barr ultimately concludes about the Obama DOJ, can this be written off as some mere piece of pro-Trump propaganda. They have to do that. Now it's what this is all about.</p><p>Now if Hillary and company had maybe spent more time trying to out-debate Trump on the big issues of the day rather than funding phony dossiers, paying all that money to Fusion GPS, maybe she would have fared better in the last election - I don't know.</p><p>And if Democrats today focused more on improving the lives of everyday Americans, instead of acting out their silly scenes in like a Kill Bill sequel, maybe they would have more to show for their first 100 days of house rule than just ridiculous subpoenas and character assassination.</p><p>I'm betting tonight that Americans prefer substance and poise over stunts and noise any day and that's THE ANGLE.</p><p>Joining me now with reaction Robert Ray, Former Whitewater Independent Counsel and delighted he's with us. Robert--</p><p>ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Good evening.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's good to see you. The Democrats - you get this clear sense. It just struck me today. This is a lot like what happened with Kavanaugh.</p><p>RAY: yes the politics of desperation, no shame and you know ad hominem attacks - the only place left to go of course is now to impugn the integrity of Bill Barr. They have also tried it with Rod Rosenstein on his way out the door, and it will continue.</p><p>And I think you are correct, it will get particularly pointed and more heated once Bill Barr does what he said he was committed to doing, and that is following up on the release of the IG's report Michael Horowitz, and eventually and finally going inside the Obama Justice Department, because it's clear he's headed there, as well as Jim Comey's tenure at the FBI.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, a new political headline neatly captures this moment. It says Democrats channeled their Trump outrage on Barr. And there was no better example of that than Speaker Pelosi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: He lied to Congress. As the Attorney General of the United States of America, was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well Barr did not actually lie, and she and her entire caucus know it. Robert, your thoughts on Pelosi's smear, where specifically is she wrong here?</p><p>RAY: Well, she's not even specifying what she thinks is the lie. I mean it's a serious charge you're talking about as you know, false statements to Congress or perjury which would be a crime.</p><p>But look, I kind of tend to agree if to just keep this simple, Ted Cruz was right, really what the Democrats are about here is they don't like the answers that they got. And the only thing that was with withheld from the American people was the space of three weeks when the Attorney General controlled the narrative before the release of the redacted Mueller report.</p><p>I mean at the end of the day, that's what this is all about. And the notion that we're now going to yet again try to criminalize one more thing, where Democrats don't get their way so the only resort they have, which is like how many times do you have to ring the bell before cry wolf, before people finally conclude they really don't know what they're talking about.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean the whole thing - Robert, the whole thing is that, when Barr testified on April 10, he was asked do you think Mueller disagreed with your conclusions.</p><p>RAY: Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Conclusion on obstruction, that's what I'm talking about.</p><p>RAY: Right, I mean that that was the central piece of it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And he said, I don't know.</p><p>RAY: And they completely ignored that, and I think to this day, from what it sounds like, as I reviewed the testimony, to this day I don't think Attorney General Barr to this day meaning today knows whether or not Bob Mueller agrees with his determination relative to the fact that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the obstruction, a portion of the investigation.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well yes, but in that phone call, the phone calls they have, they were like, well give us your notes. He asked Mueller, are you talking about the conclusions and Mueller said well he was focused on the media reaction that they kind of got the context wrong.</p><p>So, this - it's defamatory, let's just be very clear to the American public last night. The smear of one of the most brilliant legal minds in the United States with utmost integrity, Bill Barr, is one of the lowest moments of this US Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>And I've seen a lot, okay, I went back to (inaudible) for Justice Thomas. I saw what they tried to do to him, okay. Then - but then - and what they did to all these other great nominees along the way. This was disgusting. But as I said in The Angle, not at all surprising, given what we know.</p><p>RAY: No, not at all surprising. And when you look at it, I mean in order to try to make the claim, they do obviously things that frankly are beyond the pale like selectively parse and edit from the Attorney General's answer.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh that's what they did.</p><p>RAY: And once you do that, what credibility really do you have with the American people when you're trying to make an argument from really nothing that the Attorney General of the United States has committed a crime?</p><p>I mean, are you kidding?</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, this is all about trying to smear Barr before that IG report comes out in his new findings, about how this whole thing started with the Deep State. All right, I want to get this other piece of breaking news in, and this is again the real reason why Democrats are trying to take down Barr.</p><p>New York Times, of all places, shocking to a lot of people, reported today that the FBI indeed sent to spy to try to trap former Trump associate George Papadopoulos in London, all right. Papadopoulos himself always contended he was being spied on and he was laughed at, but the liberal media well they just dismissed him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This noise we are hearing from Papadopoulos and all the rest of them about something going on over there. It's spying, and I'm just wondering, spying seems to be a perfect word if you believe in the Deep State coming against Trump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he makes a charge like that, like what he said about the wiretapping, he makes governance difficult for himself.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go-go-gadget backpedal Jake.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the Attorney General to imply or to say that there was spying domestically, he knows the language very well and he knows the terminology and he knows what it connotes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now you see Barr has found out the dirty little secret about the spying conducted on the Trump campaign and he's not about to step on the Inspector General's forthcoming report on the malfeasance at the Obama FBI.</p><p>So, joining Robert Ray is former FBI Special Agent and spokesperson John Iannarelli. He's been all over this issue. John, how big of a black eye is this for the FBI, New York Times bombshell?</p><p>JOHN IANNARELLI, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: It's certainly a black eye for the people that were in charge and did this. This is unlike anything I saw in the FBI during my career. The spy at a Presidential campaign is unprecedented and how they can deny this took place is unbelievable.</p><p>Robert Ray, this is something. So Papadopoulos said he was set up.</p><p>RAY: Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's ridiculed. All these civil libertarians, by the way, Robert, like where are they tonight? All these people, these Democrats, I support the ACLU, they're all for civil liberties, except if it's the civil liberties of a conservative, or someone who is working for Trump.</p><p>RAY: Right, Papadopoulos has been saying for months, it's ridiculous prosecutorial and investigative overreach, and I think now we're finally going to get to the bottom of what is the true story here, and whether you think spying is a pejorative term or not, hey look it up.</p><p>There isn't any question that what appears to have happened is that spying was going on, not only with electronic surveillance, but also the use of informants, and what amounts to an undercover.</p><p>So, I guess the question would be, in the midst of a Presidential campaign, what you would ordinarily expect to happen, which didn't happen here, maybe he didn't want to talk directly to the candidate. But I cannot imagine law enforcement foregoing the opportunity to have communicated to somebody trusted within the campaign to say, hey look, we are looking at things.</p><p>Why didn't they go to Rudy Giuliani or Chris Christie, or Jeff sessions? Someone of integrity to say, hey look, the campaign needs to be aware of the fact that we are concerned about potential contacts with Russians, or whatever.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I will tell you why, John. They knew it was a set up from the beginning.</p><p>IANNARELLI: You are right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They knew this thing, they were hunting around, we are going to get into the Ukraine ANGLE here, they had a DNC operative trying to get dirt on Trump, in Ukraine! So where is the collusion with Russia Trump, maybe it is Ukraine-DNC.</p><p>IANNARELLI: Absolutely. Obviously, they are looking for a way to get in and get any dirt at all, as if any actually existed. And more importantly, they trusted no one in the Trump campaign? The FBI would normally make contact with somebody and say we think we may have a problem. Didn't even the decency or respect to try to make contact and say, work with us.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So Robert--</p><p>RAY: And by the way, Laura, it continued because, remember - recall also in the first weeks of the administration, Jim Comey gloated over the fact that he snuck FBI agents into the White House to talk to Michael Flynn. I mean, they were still doing it. They were still operating--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It was a big set up. Flynn was part of it, Papadopoulos, Carter Page was the dupe that they used the dossier to spy on. This was all part of a story that's unfolding, the Democrats know it, that is why they are smearing Barr. That is the only reason really to smear Barr at this point. The report is already out. Guys, fantastic conversation, love having you on. And</p><p>And still ahead, team Obama coming after our next guest for blowing the lid off of the Biden family's foreign connections; Peter Schweizer here to respond in moments. And later, should Congresswoman Omar be booted from the House Foreign Affairs Committee? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo address her latest slam on America, so stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now when it comes to the media's coverage of this White House, it's often tough to keep up with all of the falsehoods. Now we at THE INGRAHAM ANGLE are going to try to change that and hold our media brethren and sisters accountable.</p><p>Now tonight, we take a look back at a controversy that erupted over the security clearances of Trump administration officials, included a career civil servant being smeared and the existence of what they were calling a whistleblower, which some media folks just couldn't get enough of.</p><p>Tonight, we have an update to that story. For more, we are joined by Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom has been looking into it. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Laura, for the first two years of the Trump administration, Carl Kline was the White House Personnel Director. He oversaw security clearances, and that placed him squarely in the middle of a Democratic lion's den, where he was accused of being pushed by top White House aides into issuing security clearances for, among others, President Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>The Democratic outrage was promptly put forth by liberal media outlets. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elijah Cummings told me last night in his view what's happening with the security clearances is a million times worse than with Hillary Clinton and her email controversy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Security clearances are a Presidential prerogative. How do you go back and reestablish norms after processes like that have been broken as badly as they have by this President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: The common media narrative was that President Trump told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to order Carl Kline to issue Ivanka and Jared Kushner security clearances. And when McGahn refused, he told then White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to do it.</p><p>But after seven hours of testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Kline said that nobody in the White House, including John Kelly, ever interfered or pressured him to grant or revoke a security clearance.</p><p>His answer did not satisfy Democrats. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD): I guess he's basically trying to say they're just - the buck pretty much sat with them, but that's not - I mean, there's much more information that we need to dig into.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Like information from Tricia Newbold, who worked under Carl Kline but accused him publicly of mismanaging security clearance files and retaliating against her. Kline's attorney responded to Tricia Newbold's accusations last month on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. Look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT DRISCOLL, CARL KLINE'S ATTORNEY: she was below Carl in the chain of command and she was upset about some of the decisions he made and felt that her superior didn't explain them sufficiently to her. He'll be clear to that eventually, but all this is just dragging a career guy in for no reason.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: We should note, GOP Congressman Jim Jordan says he was impressed with Kline's decisions on security clearances. Laura?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, Trace, thank you so much for that scandal reporting, complete bunk.</p><p>Now on to another question, who is colluding with whom? Now the Left is also blame shifting on a story we covered extensively on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE, the Biden family's sketchy ties to Ukraine.</p><p>Now here's The New York Times headline. Biden faces conflict of interest questions that are being promoted by Trump and allies. One of President Barack Obama's most senior advisors Dan Pfeiffer suggested that it's just all a conspiracy tweeting, it's happening all over again. Peter Schweizer does oppo research funded by conservative interests. New York Times credulously writes it up. Trump and his allies bully the DOJ into investigating. Trump claims his opponent is corrupt.</p><p>Here to respond, Peter Schweizer, President of the Government Accountability Institute, who wrote the book Secret Empires that exposed the Biden family corruption. Peter, your reaction, break this down to our view - for our viewers on this Ukraine connection with Biden, and why it's not some pie-in-the-sky conspiracy theory.</p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: Yes, look, from the beginning when the book came out and even today with The New York Times confirming my reporting, what the Left is basically doing is attacking me personally and now attacking The New York Times.</p><p>They're not disputing any of the facts. And the facts are simple, Laura, and that is that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, got on the payroll of a very corrupt Ukrainian energy company called Burisma in the spring of 2014, where he was paid about $50,000 a month to do \"regulatory compliance\" for this company.</p><p>He now admits to The New York Times that's not really what he did. He doesn't describe any work that he did. And the problem of course is Hunter Biden had no background in Ukraine, no background in energy. What he did have was a father who was Vice President of the United States, who's responsible for all aid flow of Western dollars going to Ukraine, and Joe Biden made decisions about when to look the other way, when money disappeared, as it did with prebought (ph) bank and in other instances when it did.</p><p>And it's just a pattern, Laura. We talked about it on your show before, as it relates to China. The Biden family has cashed in, while Joe Biden was Vice President, and they're not refuting any of the facts, they're simply attacking me and in this case The New York Times.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, in a few moments, I'm going to talk to Secretary of State Pompeo about Biden's curious position on China that they're not a threat.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: You bet.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They are not a threat at all, it's just I guess a friendly country that's not very powerful. Do you think we're going to learn more about this Ukraine connection and specifically all the trips that Biden made in that last year of the Obama-Biden Presidency?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes, I mean very curious when right before Donald Trump was being sworn in, in the United States, where was Joe Biden in all places of the world? He was in Ukraine. Very, very unusual for a sitting Vice President to spend his last few days in a foreign country that far away.</p><p>We need to learn more about this. I've said before the Senate needs to have Hunter Biden come and testify and explain the $1.5 billion private equity deal he got from the Chinese government, flying over on Air Force Two with his dad, and he needs to explain this deal with the Ukrainians that makes absolutely no sense.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Peter, we're out of time but think of what they say about Ivanka and Jared that they're profiting and they're making all this money. They're working in Washington leaving the cushy lifestyle sure they had in Manhattan, trying to do stuff for this administration.</p><p>But they accuse them of everything, it always turns out to be false. And meanwhile, we have Hunter Biden making a lot of money, while Biden was Vice President. And Chuck Todd and these people, they're always just a bunch of conservatives attacking Biden, poor old Biden.</p><p>Unbelievable. Peter, we are going to keep tracking it. Thank you for your reporting on this as always.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And coming up, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar says the chaos in Venezuela is all America's fault. And Joe Biden, as I was saying, wonders what the big deal is about China anyway. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with his exclusive reaction next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Venezuela was once a thriving, prosperous country, but under socialist leaders like Hugo Chavez and now Nicolas Maduro, the government's seizure of companies meant that when their main resource, oil, saw volatility, the economy collapsed. Now nearly nine in 10 Venezuelans live in poverty. Food is so scarce reports say that some have been forced to eat pigeons and cats they find in the street. Maduro has only tightened his grip, imprisoning political opponents, and all of this leading to violent clashes. And the global community, including the U.S., has lined up behind opposition leader Juan Guaido. Despite all that, Congressman Ilhan Omar is, well, you guessed it, blaming us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR, (D) MINNESOTA: A lot of the policies that we have put in place has kind of helped lead the devastation in Venezuela, and we've sort of set the stage for a where are arriving today, this particular bullying and the use of sanctions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Here now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us tonight. When you hear a member of the House of Representatives put the blame squarely on the, quote, \"bullies\" in the United States, what we are seeing tonight in Venezuela, what is your reaction?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: So the nicest thing I can say is it is unbelievable ignorance. It is just factually wrong. You hit it in your opening, Laura. The problems in Venezuela have been years in the making, it has been a socialist regime, first with Chavez, now with Maduro, the destruction of a wealthy nation, a nation with more oil reserves than any other country in the world.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Beautiful country, too.</p><p>POMPEO: And a beautiful country with beautiful real estate, beautiful shorelines, all kinds of opportunity. And for a member of Congress, frankly, one who sits on an important national security committee, to make a statement blaming America first in this way, it's not only ignorant, it's disgusting.</p><p>INGRAHAM: What can you tell us tonight, still not a successful transition in Venezuela. Guaido was the guy that the world community chose. Why is he the right one at the right time?</p><p>POMPEO: So the world community has certainly supported him, but the Venezuelan people chose him through their national assembly and through their constitutional process. The military didn't fracture in the way that we would hope, but it is just a matter of time. It is the case that Maduro may rule for a little while longer, but he is not going to govern. Structurally, there is no way he stays in power. It is time for him to leave, and we need the Cubans and the Russians to follow him out the door.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, to the Americans who say we have a problem at our southern border, we've got 100,000 people a month being apprehended and released into the country, why are we focusing at all on Venezuela, what do you say to them?</p><p>POMPEO: So we can do more than one thing at a time. We have an obligation to secure our southern border, but we have had 3 million people, 3 million migrants leave Venezuela, too. They will end up somewhere. Today they are in Colombia, Chile, Peru. We have an important responsibility in Venezuela. First, we want to support democracy in South America, it is important for our vital national security interest, but it's also the case when we see a humanitarian crisis like this, the American people understand that taking food and providing humanitarian support is something that's in our nature.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I want to move on to another topic, which is China, something that you've been addressing lately. I've been talking about this for 20 years. But Joe Biden doesn't seem to think China is a big threat. Let's watch let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They can't even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea in the mountains in the east -- I meet in the west. They are not bad folks, folks, but guess what? They are not competition for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I don't personally know what to say about that. But China not a threat to the United States, what is the truth they are?</p><p>POMPEO: President Trump and our administration has taken the threat from China very, very seriously, very different from what we just heard there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's leading in the polls.</p><p>POMPEO: We understand the threat. There is a trade imbalance that President Trump has taken on to try and get fair and reciprocal trade between the United States and China. The fact that the Chinese are working to put their systems and networks all across the world so they can steal your information and my information.</p><p>INGRAHAM: How about American universities?</p><p>POMPEO: And American universities, to feed this information back into their system. You've talked about this, we've talked about a million of their ethnic minorities being held in reeducation camps in Jianxin. This is stuff that is reminiscent of the 1930s. They present a real challenge to United States, and this administration is prepared to take this on.</p><p>INGRAHAM: American high-tech companies in China, there's a lot of concern that there has been, I guess, inadvertent assistance to the communist regime there as they seek to dominate part of their Belt and Road Initiative, dominate every major industry, including space and weaponry, artificial intelligence. What can you tell us about the concerns about American big tech going to China and setting up a shop?</p><p>POMPEO: We've talked about this, and we've got out to talk to each of these businesses. Laura, it is true, I think America was slow to recognize this challenge, the previous administration, the Obama administration just didn't want to touch it. The first step is to make these businesses aware. This is what this technology is being used for, here's who you are selling to, the separation between private companies and government doesn't exist there, not remotely like we have in the United States. And so we have made clear to them that their technology is being used in ways that they may not be aware of, and the impact, not only the impact it has for American national security, but the impact it will have on their business and the business' reputation is very real.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Mr. Secretary, I also want your reaction to something one of your predecessors said last night on MSNBC. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly packing Republicans, why don't we ask China to back us? Not only that, China, if you are listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns? Let's have a great power contest and let's get the Chinese in on the side of somebody else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Leading Democrat, she was on for an hour last night. The great power contest, asking China to dump the tax returns.</p><p>POMPEO: So there is a great power contest taking place, I think that's true. I only wish when she was secretary of state, she would've taken it on instead of allowing it to get to where it is today and turning a willful blind eye to that. We are taking this seriously. I hadn't heard those comments before. They don't remotely sound like what ought to be done by America, and they're certainly not what President Trump and this administration is going to do to make sure we keep America safe, that we recognize China has 1.5 billion people, there will be commerce between the two countries, but we've got to make sure that America is prepared so that we can continue to be the world's leading power 10, 20, 50 years from now.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are you having more fun now than you were as CIA director? I was thinking about that, if I could choose between one and the other, which one is more fun?</p><p>POMPEO: They are very different jobs. I have enjoyed them both.</p><p>INGRAHAM: What a diplomat. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here tonight, I really appreciate it.</p><p>POMPEO: Thank you very much.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Thanks for being here tonight.</p><p>One of our favorites is here next, Dr. Drew Pinsky, on Burger King's unhappy meals, plus dangerous college speech codes at his alma mater. He's going to tell us about it, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: One of our favorites is back with us tonight to tackle a few ridiculous stories. Why not? Board certified internist, host of \"Dr. Drew After Dark,\" Dr. Drew Pinsky joins us now.</p><p>Doctor, we've got a lot of stuff to get to. First up, fast food giant Burger King used to be known for its snappy slogan, \"Have it your way,\" but now they've launched a bizarre new campaign that takes on its rival, McDonald's, happy meals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I love the pissed meal. Dr. Drew, should major brands like these be wading into mental health issues, with the yaaas box, too?</p><p>DR. DREW PINSKY, CELEBRITY DOCTOR: The yaaas box is what it is. But not so much. It is Mental Health Awareness Month, and God bless them for wanting to bring awareness about mental health. But I am flabbergasted at the way they are doing it, that the DGAF box or the pissed meal or the salty meal says anything about mental health? But here we are talking about mental health, so goal achieved, guys. I guess it is just about having the conversation.</p><p>But what I find very strange, Laura, is that they teamed up with Mental Health America. I don't know who they are. It is an organization that says they're all about preventing people from developing mental health issues or progressing in their mental health problems. And I looked at their board of directors. There are no physicians on the board of directors. I thought we have the National Alliance of Mental Illness, we have National Institute of Mental Health, we American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association. How about bringing those guys in? I don't know that they would be so hip on these meals you are producing. I'm just saying.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I love the fact that people are talking about mental health challenges, because it is common and we all go through difficult times in our lives, and I'm glad they're doing that. However, I don't think people go to get food to get into a discussion. People are just running in to get a meal. So I think they are wrapping a fight with McDonald's, healthy competition with McDonald's, into we care about mental health. I think it's a little off. It seems off to me.</p><p>PINSKY: It is quite off, but the weird thing, Laura, is here we are talking about it. So they want to sell hamburgers, we are talking about Burger King, though we're talking about McDonald's in the same breath. They want awareness about Mental Health Awareness Month, we are talking about that. So in some weird way, mission accomplished. But I'm just saying, I don't know what they've accomplished other than just saying it is Mental Health Awareness Month. If we want to really -- put some of the suicide prevention hotline on there, talk about the symptoms of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, educate people, give us something on the box other than \"yaaas.\" I'm just saying, Laura. I'm just saying. Far be it from me to judge.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dr. Drew, I need to get to this. In March, your alma mater, Amherst College, put out a common language guide, it's a 40-page glossary of terms, and it's supposed to address a need to come to a common and shared understanding of language around identity, privilege, oppression, and inclusion. The guide included a whopping 97 terms under gender and the gender identity section. It has since I guess been taken down from the website, college's website, but you can still find it online. So my question to you, are these kinds of gender codes getting out of control? What is going on here?</p><p>PINSKY: Again, I like the idea of trying to have language, because I can't keep track of things day-to-day. I don't know about you, but I would love a code of language that I can make sure I am using language appropriately.</p><p>But in this little circular, they are also saying things like, well, if you're a heterosexual white female you can't be a feminist because you are part of the male white privilege oppression, and therefore your view of feminism is so deeply skewed that you can't possibly say anything. So that is part of your onus, you guys.</p><p>The other thing is, that as you go down -- two things. One is, we're talking about controlling language, and that is a very dangerous road to go down. That bothers me on one hand. And the other is, it ends up being a snake that starts eating itself. For instance, as you go down the road of gender discussions, eventually somebody starts coming to the conclusion that gender doesn't exist. It is purely a social construct. If there is no gender, if there is no male, and if you can't have two males or you can't have two females, and you can't have a male and a female, gay doesn't exist. Heterosexual doesn't exist. And suddenly the snake is eating itself. And a lot of people are not too happy with that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, colleges -- it is now becoming absolutely insane. Liberals were supposed to be about being open to conversation, and now they are all about codes and controlling conduct. Dr. Drew, great to see you, as always.</p><p>PINSKY: Thank you. You, too, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And coming up, possible conflicts of interest popping up for the state's attorney who refused to prosecute Jussie Smollett. Plus, a Democratic mayor we interviewed right here resigns in shame. We're going to tell you why, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Have you seen this? Kim Foxx has found herself in hot water again. You know her well. She's the state attorney who refused to prosecute hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett despite all of the evidence against him. Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast Newsroom again with all the details. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, the judge in this case made it crystal clear he was set to rule on whether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Jussie Smollett case, then the woman who petitioned for it put the brakes on. Former Appellate Court Judge Sheila O'Brien asked the judge to recuse himself because his son works for Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx. Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. was unhappy but agreed to consider it, so the legal jockeying here and goes on. O'Brien is fighting for a special prosecutor because she says Smollett received special treatment, but State's Attorney Kim Foxx filed a motion arguing that a special prosecutor might interfere with the investigation now underway by the Cook County Inspector General.</p><p>So Foxx is now against a special prosecutor, but in late March she rode an op-ed in \"The Chicago Tribune\" saying she was in favor of it, quote, \"Let me state publicly and clearly that I welcome an outside, nonpolitical review of how we handled this matter. I am not perfect, nor is any other prosecutor out there, but ensuring that I and my office have our communities trust is paramount.\" Foxx is also trying to prevent the release of original files and documents from her and her top deputy, Joseph Magats, saying the request for information violates state law. Foxx and Joseph Magats were not in court today, saying they were not bound by subpoenas mandating their presence.</p><p>Meantime, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh announced her resignation today. Many called on her to quit after it was revealed that she made roughly $800,000 from her children's books about health and nutrition from sales to hospitals and other companies with ties to the city. Some believe they were just illegal kickbacks. Laura?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Unbelievable. Trace, hardworking tonight for us. Trace, thanks so much.</p><p>We'll be right back with the last bite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Every citizen has the absolute right to live according to the teachings of their faith and then convictions of their heart. This is the bedrock of American life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Trump's words today after the National Prayer Breakfast, amazing. Especially the comfort provided to Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein and from San Diego and the wake of that devastating attack on his synagogue. It was a great moment today, not covered by many in the process at the White House. It deserved more attention.</p><p>That's all the time we have tonight. Remember my podcast, Kellyanne Conway exclusive today. She was on fire. You've got to listen to it. Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team take it all from here.</p><p>Shannon?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019050201cb257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1F-SSH1-JB20-G2DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7245\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009QIK</classCode><className>BURGER KING WORLDWIDE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS722513 LIMITED-SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC5812 EATING PLACES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do or decline.</p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour......and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.How we compete and thrive in this world......how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.Nothing matters more.\u00a0Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end......Britain on the rise.BRITAIN CAN DELIVERThough the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country.\u00a0Why?Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0We saw it this summer.\u00a0The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics......the best country in the world......and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.I was trying to think of my favourite moment.\u00a0Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years...\u00a0...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0\u00a0And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did.\u00a0When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.And the Olympics showed us something else.\u00a0Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland.......they draped themselves in one flag.\u00a0Now, there's one person who didn't like that......and he's called Alex Salmond.\u00a0I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014.\u00a0There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom......let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got.There are so many people to thank for this summer.Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games......and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces......the zinger on the zip-wire......the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson.\u00a0And those Games-Makers.You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society......they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office.\u00a0By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end.\u00a0Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done......and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do.\u00a0CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVERTo meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.Just ask Clive Stone.\u00a0I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition.\u00a0He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive......please, if you get in, do something about it.\u00a0And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting.There was a reason we could do that.\u00a0It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts.\u00a0No other party made that commitment.\u00a0Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives.To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down......I say......well, yes, you've got a point.I'll tell you what is down.Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay.\u00a0We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too.\u00a0I know some are sceptical about our aid budget.\u00a0But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa.\u00a0See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine......the difference between living and dying...\u00a0...how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money.\u00a0Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0\u00a0Here's something else this party's done in government.\u00a0Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels.\u00a0It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests......and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before......I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.We're doing big, Conservative things.\u00a0For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half.\u00a0For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns.\u00a0For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer......well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice.\u00a0Be proud of what we've done already.Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.BRITAIN ON THE RISEBig, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.We can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.All around the world, countries are on the rise.Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years......but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.What do the countries on the rise have in common?They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.And what do the countries on the slide have in common?They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece......while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0\u00a0I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.And we here know how that is done.It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration...... the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.Aspiration is the engine of progress.Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living......the most powerful natural resource we have is our people.\u00a0Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers......not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses......but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope.\u00a0That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation......to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people.\u00a0And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.It's not just about growth and GDP......it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going.\u00a0We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer......by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined.\u00a0We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it.\u00a0Let me put that another way.We don't preach about one nation but practise class war......we just get behind people who want to get on in life.\u00a0The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.They call us the party of the better-off......no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.THE RIGHT IDEASThis party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style.\u00a0But there's a problem with that.\u00a0It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care.\u00a0My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.Because we know what we're up against.\u00a0We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.'\u00a0No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich......it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach.\u00a0These three things are essential to helping our people rise.They are essential to our success in this world.\u00a0And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way.\u00a0So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future......they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.ECONOMYTo help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.There are some basic things they need to do that.Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.Getting the deficit down is essential for both.That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise.\u00a0Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us.\u00a0That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts.\u00a0But here is the crucial thing you need to know.\u00a0Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years.\u00a025 per cent.\u00a0\u00a0That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels......keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 Giving businesses more confidence to invest.Creating more jobs.And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years.\u00a0LABOUR\u00a0Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.They call it Plan B and it goes like this:\u00a0We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy.\u00a0It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that.\u00a0Let me tell you why it's not.Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts.\u00a0Some may actually refuse to lend us that money.\u00a0Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates.\u00a0That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.When they were in office, their answer was always:Borrow more money.Now they're out of office it's:Borrow more money.Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.Borrow, borrow, borrow.\u00a0Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not the government's money: their money.Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva?\u00a0Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here......it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden......and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.Under Labour.We haven't forgotten, you know.\u00a0We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold......who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy......who ruined our reputation, who risked our future......who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it.\u00a0ASPIRATION ECONOMYTo get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy......more enterprising, more aspirational......and it's taking shape already.We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history.\u00a0Let me repeat that.\u00a0The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record.\u00a0We're making things again.We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new.\u00a0We're number one in the world for offshore wind.Number one in the world for tidal power.The world's first green investment bank.\u00a0Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.Look at the new investment coming in.\u00a0In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here.\u00a0And we are selling to the world again.\u00a0When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got......turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.And look what's happening.In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent......to China - 40 per cent......to Russia - 80 per cent.\u00a0There are so many opportunities in this world.\u00a0I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them.\u00a0It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies.\u00a0He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts.\u00a0They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm......helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming.\u00a0Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700.\u00a0Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month.\u00a0So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.\u00a0And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China......whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence......I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts......and in that battle I believe in leading from the front.\u00a0To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had.\u00a0Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people.\u00a0The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand......but no we can't reform planning.\"It's simple.For a business to expand, it needs places to build.If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool.\u00a0But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them.\u00a0If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all.\u00a0And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"......but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents?\u00a033 years old.\u00a0We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house......we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage......but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams.\u00a0WELFAREIf we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.Here's two facts for you.\u00a0Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends.\u00a0Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy.\u00a0Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.Here are mine.First, unfairness.\u00a0\u00a0What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit.\u00a0The second evil: injustice.Here's the choice we give our young people today.\u00a0Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.We must be crazy.So this is what we've done.Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too.\u00a0If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?The next evil: bureaucracy.\u00a0Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life?\u00a0For people like him we're doing something new.\u00a0The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole......and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless......and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone.\u00a0And just one more thing on welfare.You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?Here's what one union official said about it.\u00a0I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work.\u00a0We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance.\u00a0What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery......and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.EDUCATION\u00a0To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do.\u00a0Educate all our children.And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year.\u00a0In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind......not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too.\u00a0This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder.\u00a0You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids?\u00a0Well - this is a pushy government.\u00a0My approach is very simple.\u00a0I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine.\u00a0To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area......I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.We've heard from some of them this week......not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come......but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools......independent schools, in the state sector.That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now.\u00a0The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed.\u00a0It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no.\u00a0When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers......Longer school days to help children learn... Flexible school hours to help parents work......More stretching exams for those who're really able... Less nonsense about health and safety......the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren't the children succeeding?\u00a0You hear the same thing over and over again.'What can you expect with children like these?' they say.\u00a0 'These children are disadvantaged.'Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage.\u00a0But isn't the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it's like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?It's that toxic culture of low expectations - that lack of ambition for every child - which has held this country back.Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.Because our children can't wait.So when people say we should slow down our education reforms - so adults can adjust to them, I say:I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school...\u00a0...I say: yes - you're absolutely right.\u00a0I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it.I don't have a hard luck story.My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them.\u00a0\u00a0My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be.\u00a0 But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child.\u00a0 Probably a lonely child.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Dad was the eternal optimist.\u00a0 To him the glass was always half full.\u00a0 Usually with something alcoholic in it.When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.\u00a0\u00a0He told me what he was most proud of.\u00a0\u00a0It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.\u00a0\u00a0Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off.Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.\u00a0\u00a0Work hard.\u00a0 Family comes first.\u00a0 But put back in to the community too.There is nothing complicated about me.I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.This is still the greatest country on earth.\u00a0 We showed that again this summer.\u00a0 22nd in world population.\u00a0 3rd in the medals table.\u00a0\u00a0But it's tough.\u00a0 These are difficult times.\u00a0 We're being tested.\u00a0\u00a0How will we come through it?\u00a0 Again, it's not complicated.Hard work.\u00a0 Strong families.\u00a0 Taking responsibility.\u00a0 Serving others.As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door:\u00a0 Those who can should, those who can't we will always help.The job of this party... of this government... is to help to bring out the best in this country.\u00a0 Because at our best we're unbeatable.We know Britain can deliver because we've seen it time and again.\u00a0This is the country that... invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile.... there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win?\u00a0 Yes.Can we - the people who invented the welfare state in the first place - turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0\u00a0Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world?\u00a0 Yes. Of course we can.Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge - let's build an aspiration nation......let's get Britain on the rise.Deficit, paid down.\u00a0 Tough decisions, taJken.\u00a0 Growth, fired up.\u00a0 Aspiration, backed all the way.\u00a0\u00a0We know what it takes to win... to win in the tough world of today.... to win for all our people... to win for Britain.\u00a0 So let's get out there and do it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-5063061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56TK-D271-J9YR-G47V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5593\"/><timeReceived>4:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Independent.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>October 10, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLR8</classCode><className>UK CONSERVATIVE PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLPE</classCode><className>UK POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;
