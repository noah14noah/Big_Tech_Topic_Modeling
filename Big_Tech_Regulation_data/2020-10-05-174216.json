Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world,\" she said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Medium</url> post. \"It's a great story - but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\"</p><p>Warren reasoned that when markets are competitive, innovative companies are allowed to shine which motivates everyone in that competition to produce better products and services.</p><p>      See related\u00a0</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Her proposals have a whiff of those brought against Microsoft in the late nineties regarding its antitrust suit with USA's Department of Justice (DOJ). In an attempt to combat Microsoft's monopoly of the personal computer market, lawmakers tried to prevent the company from bundling Internet Explorer in with its Windows PCs.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"\u00a0</p><p>The same sort of logic applies here with her plan to dismantle tech companies from their subsidiary arms. Facebook would have to be a completely separate entity from Instagram and WhatsApp. Amazon could remain as an e-commerce platform but cut ties with Amazon Basics and Amazon Marketplace.</p><p>This is so manufacturers won't be overshadowed by Amazon's own renditions of a product that's naturally promoted to the top of its own platform which happens to also be a globally popular go-to for practically any shopping requirement.</p><p>Warren plans to achieve this by targeting any platform with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/apps/27338/users-can-already-buy-drugs-and-guns-on-facebook-marketplace\">an online marketplace</url> or exchange with a global revenue of \u00a325bn or more and then redesigning them as 'platform utilities'.</p><p>This would entail new laws having to be created, prohibiting these companies from owning both the platform utility and any participants of that platform, while having to \"meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\".</p><p>\"For smaller companies (those with annual global revenue of between $90 million and $25 billion), their platform utilities would be required to meet the same standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users, but would not be required to structurally separate from any participant on the platform,\" she said.</p><p>She also wants to put a stop to big companies simply swallowing their competition in the form of massive mergers. To do this, she proposes the advent of a regulatory body to oversee the nature of these allegedly illegal and anti-competitive mergers.</p><p>\"Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market - which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/privacy/33128/facebooks-2fa-accused-of-violating-user-privacy\">including about privacy</url>,\" she said.</p><p>Although she would have just won the hearts of SMBs, startups and privacy advocates across the States with these proposals, she cautions that the internet isn't likely to change too drastically.</p><p>\"You'll still be able to go on Google and search like you do today. You'll still be able to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. You'll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing.\"</p><p>What will change is the landscape of the products made available. Those 30 coffee machines will be comprised of other brands not yet heard of as they would have been allowed to flourish in an open, competitive market.</p><p>She also thinks privacy will be impacted in a positive way. Citing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/privacy/33169/zuckerberg-reiterates-facebook-data-sharing-ambition-despite-privacy-concerns\">Facebook's interoperability with Instagram and WhatsApp</url>, she said that the disconnection of the services will encourage Facebook to dedicate more effort to improve the user experience and privacy of the services.</p><p>\"We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold - and do it in a way that doesn't lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data,\" Warren said.\u00a0</p><p>\"We must help America's content creators -- from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians - keep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"And we must ensure that Russia - or any other foreign power - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/31527/how-russia-hacked-the-2016-election\">can't use Facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections</url>.\"</p><h>Apple hasn't escaped</h><p>In a follow-up interview with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Verge</emphasis>, Warren added another name to her hit list. She said Apple can't both host an app store and then sell apps on it too.</p><p>\"Apple, you've got to break it apart from their App Store. It's got to be one or the other,\" Warren said. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\"</p><p>Much in the same way she singles out Amazon and its Basics range for a market monopoly on the platform, under her proposed laws, Apple wouldn't be able to push apps like iMovie, Pages and Apple News. This would allow competitors such as Adobe Clip, Microsoft Word and the BBC to gain more widespread exposure on a platform dominated by its creator. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPITPR-33193athttpswwwitprocouk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPITPR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-YSY1-JB2G-R0PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464401</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

But some experts are starting to see parallels between tech and finance, especially after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., last week unveiled her most specific plan to date designed to curb technology companies' power and influence in the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE:</emphasis> [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/cartoons/2019/01/30/cartoons-on-the-2020-presidential-election\">Cartoons on the 2020 Presidential Election</url>]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Like finance pre-2008, the tech sector has long been praised as a source of innovation, growth, and social progress. But like finance post-2008, we are now witnessing a reckoning as we come to terms with the deep dangers of modern tech giants, from misinformation on online platforms to monopoly power of Amazon,\" says K. Sabeel Rahman, an associate professor at Brooklyn Law School and president of the left-leaning Demos think tank. </p><p>Indeed, the mammoth size and influence these companies wield has led some to label them monopolies. As Warren noted in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">blog post</url>, more than       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-digital-ad-spending-will-surpass-traditional-in-2019\">two-thirds</url> of all advertising revenues in the U.S. last year went to Google, Facebook and Amazon. Google and Facebook for years have dominated global internet traffic, and Amazon's dominance of the e-commerce space has helped reshape what it means to go shopping. </p><p>Sprinkle in a handful of privacy and data sharing scandals that have plagued social media companies like Facebook -- and news this week that Facebook had temporarily removed a handful of Warren ads vowing to break up major tech companies -- and American lawmakers are facing growing a public support for legislative action designed to rein in a sector some have deemed too powerful for its own good. </p><p>\"The new tech companies are ... kind of like the companies of the early 20th century. The robber-barons -- Standard Oil and J.P. Morgan,\" Roger McNamee, an investor and venture capitalist who was an early investor in Facebook before publicly souring on the company's business model, said Wednesday during an appearance on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-13/antitrust-is-most-pro-growth-way-to-deal-with-big-tech-roger-mcnamee-says-video\">Bloomberg TV</url>. \"Whether you break them up or not is less important than you prevent them from operating in ways that stall the economy, which is what you've got going on right now.\" </p><p>Warren, who was instrumental in the founding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the aftermath of the financial crisis, is hopeful that she can help lead a similar antitrust charge against the country's largest tech companies to what was seen following the financial crisis and during the early 1900s, when antitrust cases curbed the influence of companies like Standard Oil, the American Tobacco Company and the Northern Securities Company. </p><p>Arguing that \"today's big tech companies have too much power,\" Warren's plan calls for the retroactive breakup of mergers she considers to be anticompetitive and monopolistic, including Amazon-Whole Foods and Facebook-Instagram. It would also prohibit companies with $25 billion in annual revenues to self-deal on their own platforms, essentially forcing a structural separation that would, for example, prevent Amazon from selling its own generic products on its own platform. </p><p>The plan would also force these large tech companies to adhere to nondiscrimination requirements and data sharing limitations. </p><p>\"The first two elements of this plan invoke classic antitrust tools: undoing mergers and acquisitions, and implementing structural separations between different lines of business to prevent self-dealing,\" says Rahman. \"The third element -- nondiscrimination requirements -- is more akin to public utility style regulations, akin to requiring 'common carriage' norms where, for example, inns and transit systems cannot discriminate among users.\" </p><p>Warren is hardly the only presidential hopeful to rail against monopolistic powers in the U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has voiced similar concerns about America's major tech companies, as has Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran his 2016 campaign for the Democratic nomination for president on promises to break up the country's largest banks and financial institutions. </p><p>But Warren's ideas are similarly not short on skeptics. Former Starbucks CEO and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz called the plan \"inconsistent with our free-enterprise system\" and suggested Warren is peddling \"fantasy ideas that will never be implemented.\" </p><p>U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Tom Donohue has warned that Warren's plan would \"take us back to the stone age, hurt consumers and stifle innovation.\" And Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, predicted such a proposal would hurt consumers by \"reducing convenience, reducing quality of service and innovation and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services.\" </p><p>\"Consumers now benefit greatly from having one Amazon, one Google and one Facebook,\" he said. \"The goal of competition policy should be to enhance consumer welfare, not penalize companies for earning market share and operating at scale.\" </p><p>Warren's plan, at this point, is more talking point than substantive legislation. But supporters of her ideas say they're optimistic about where she has placed the starting point for antitrust negotiations. </p><p>\"This is a position. There's no guarantee you finish there, but you want to start with a position that says we want to do something dramatic,\" McNamee said. \"I think you can achieve some of this without breaking them up, but the threat of breaking them up is the way you get them to the table to have the conversations that we need to have.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE:</emphasis> [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/photos/2019/03/07/march-2019-in-photos-2020-elections-trump-brexit-immigration-mueller-venezuela\">March 2019 in Photos</url>]</p><p>Warren may also find political support from an unlikely source -- a sect of Republican lawmakers who have likewise grown disillusioned with America's largest tech companies. Freshman Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, grilled Google's senior privacy counsel during a hearing last week and slammed the Federal Trade Commission's response to privacy scandals at Google and Facebook as \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/2019-03-11_LETTER_FTC_privacy.pdf\">toothless</url>\" in a letter distributed Monday. </p><p>And Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has long blasted the tech industry for what he describes as conservative censorship and liberal bias, was an unlikely supporter of Warren this week after her campaign's ads were removed from Facebook. \"First time I've ever retweeted <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren\"> @ewarren</url> But she's right--Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech. They shouldn't be censoring Warren, or anybody else. A serious threat to our democracy,\" Cruz tweeted. </p><p>Warren's fight to rein in tech is still considered a gamble, in no small part because of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/03/big-tech-elizabeth-warren-break-up-plan/\">lobbying efforts</url> likely to impede her plan from getting off the ground. But, if the financial reforms of the past decade are at all indicative of where the tech conversation will go, this is likely not an issue that will be easily swept under the rug. </p><p>\"Regardless of which party these tech giants donate to, the reality is that they have too much economic and political power to persist unregulated,\" Rahman says. \"The mark of good policy is whether it speaks to the public's needs and our deepest values, not whether it generates political blowback or not.\"</p><p/><p>Andrew Soergel is a Senior Reporter at U.S. News.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] Sen. Elizabeth Warren is doubling down on her mission to break up big tech. On Tuesday, Warren, who is running for president in the 2020 election, called out Amazon in a town hall speech[4], accusing the retail giant of using data that it collects from sellers and buyers to create its own private label products. The term private label refers to products sold under various brands belonging directly to Amazon. This practice would \"knock out\" the competition, Warren said. \"Giant tech companies have too much power,\" Warren tweeted[5]. \"My plan to #BreakUpBigTech[6] prevents corporations like Amazon from knocking out the rest of the competition. You can be an umpire, or you can be a player\u2014but you can't be both.\" Read more: Warren's plan to fight big tech directly threatens one of Amazon's most successful businesses[7] Amazon made a rare public response to her comments on Twitter later that day, saying that it does not use individual sellers' data to launch its own private label products. A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1120780868614627328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw We don't use individual sellers' data to launch private label products (which account for only about 1% of sales). And sellers aren't being \"knocked out\" - they're seeing record sales every year. Also, Walmart is much larger; Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/5wXTfaAHuN\">https://t.co/5wXTfaAHuN</url>[8] Warren responded again, writing on Twitter: \"When Amazon can tilt the online marketplace in its own favor, small businesses see an immediate impact in their profits. That can be absolutely crushing, it's not fair, and I'm fighting to end that.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1120847140740304901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw When Amazon can tilt the online marketplace in its own favor, small businesses see an immediate impact in their profits. That can be absolutely crushing, it's not fair, and I'm fighting to end that.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/eV2ZvHuzJT\">https://t.co/eV2ZvHuzJT</url>[9] Amazon has come under scrutiny[10] in the past for its role as both a direct seller and a platform for other merchants to sell to those same customers. Bloomberg reported[11] in 2016 that Amazon had been using sellers' data to create its own versions of best-selling items. It is under an initial probe[12] by European regulators for its role as both direct seller and merchant platform as of December 2018, and may face a full investigation[13]. Warren has been hot on big tech for some time. In March, she announced her plan to break up some of the largest US tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. In this proposal, she called out Amazon's Marketplace for third-party sellers and said it would \"be split apart\" from its private label \"Basics\" offering. Amazon has argued that external sellers perform better than its own brands. Amazon Marketplace has been outpacing Amazon's direct sales for years, and this area of the business now accounts for more than half of Amazon's total sales on its website[14]. \"Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt,\" CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in the company's annual letter to shareholders[15] in April. Amazon's own private-label offering still accounts for a small part of its total business; roughly 1% of the company's total retail sales, according to a company spokesperson. However, it is making moves to grow this and has significantly increased the number of private-label brands available in recent years. According to estimates from investment company SunTrust Robinson Humphrey[16], Amazon's private-label business could generate $25 billion by 2022. \"Private label is one of the highly under-appreciated trends within Amazon, in our view, which over time should give the company a strong 'unfair' competitive advantage,\" the company wrote in a note in June.NOW WATCH: Facial

Here\u2019s the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">sign-up</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We\u2019re covering a deal over the special counsel\u2019s files, a fatal helicopter crash in Manhattan, and a critical win by the Golden State Warriors. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump threatens further tariffs on China</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having concluded that his tariff threat worked against Mexico, President Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-china.html\">has vowed to impose more tariffs against China</url> if it doesn\u2019t accept American trade demands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president said on Monday that he would place 25 percent tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods if a planned meeting with President Xi Jinping did not happen this month during a Group of 20 summit meeting.</p><p>Economists and business leaders have rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the current tariffs are doing no harm to the American economy and say that the trade war is slowing global growth.</p><p>Related: Mexico\u2019s foreign minister said on Monday that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/immigration-mexico-deal-trump.html\">no secret immigration deal existed between his country and the U.S.</url>, but that policies might be changed. Mr. Trump has said that a \u201cfully signed and documented\u201d agreement will soon be revealed.</p><p>Another angle: Despite continuing trade tensions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/business/dealbook/trade-war-earnings.html\">estimates for company earnings have barely budged</url>. Analysts have found it hard to quantify the costs of various on-again, off-again trade conflicts, or threats of future measures.</p><p>Justice Department shares Mueller documents</p><p>The department on Monday <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/mueller-judiciary-committee.html\">began providing Congress</url> with what the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called \u201cinterview notes, firsthand accounts of misconduct and other critical evidence\u201d collected by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. </p><p>The precise scope or usefulness of the material was unclear, but Democrats believe it could shed light on possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Trump.</p><p>What\u2019s next: A vote is planned today on a measure that would empower the Judiciary Committee to take Attorney General William Barr and other subpoena-defying witnesses to court. But the panel\u2019s deal with the Justice Department appeared to lower tensions.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren has big plans</p><p>The senator from Massachusetts<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-policies-platform.html\">has issued the largest number of detailed policy plans</url> among the major Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 roughly 20 in all, on subjects as varied as Big Tech regulation, housing costs and Pentagon contracting. </p><p>Ms. Warren is hoping that her ambitious agenda will win over Democratic primary voters, and that her emphasis on protecting American workers will have crossover appeal in a general election. </p><p>Critics say her plans \u2014 many of which call for new regulations \u2014 would hurt business, stifle innovation and potentially harm the workers they are intended to help.</p><p>Another angle: Minnesota is the only state with a legislature that isn\u2019t controlled by one party. With most legislative sessions over for the year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/state-legislatures-partisan-polarized.html\">the laws passed show increasingly ideological agendas</url>.</p><p>Smaller rivals join push against Big Tech</p><p>As government regulators increase scrutiny of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, companies from multibillion-dollar software makers to small businesses <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/technology/big-tech-antitrust-scrutiny.html\">are lining up to complain</url>. </p><p>\u201cObviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\u201d President Trump said about tech giants on Monday. The companies have fought the idea that they act anticompetitively.</p><p>Quotable: \u201cWe\u2019re in the moment where regulators hang a shingle and say, \u2018We\u2019re open,\u2019\u201d said Luther Lowe, an official at Yelp, the local search and reviewing site. \u201cThe dozens of companies who have been quietly venting in Silicon Valley can begin to form a single-file line.\u201d</p><p>The day the music burned</p><p>A 2008 fire at Universal Studios Hollywood destroyed famous movie sets and a film and videotape archive. It was also the biggest disaster in the history of the music business \u2014 and almost nobody knew. </p><p>The Universal Music Group \u2014 the largest music company in the world \u2014 lost its entire West Coast archive. Hundreds of thousands of original recordings were lost, from musicians including Louis Armstrong, pictured above, Joan Baez and Eminem. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/universal-fire-master-recordings.html\">The Times Magazine tells the story of the fire</url>. </p><p>Helicopter crash in New York: A helicopter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/nyregion/helicopter-crash-nyc.html\">crashed onto the roof of a 51-story building</url> in Midtown Manhattan, killing the pilot, the only person aboard.

It was a sunny day in February, a couple of weeks after Warren announced her candidacy for president, and she was wearing a navy North Face jacket and black sneakers with, as usual, rimless glasses and small gold earrings. Her hair had drifted a bit out of place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dog, Bailey, is a golden retriever who had already been deployed by her presidential campaign in a tweet a week earlier, a pink-tongued snapshot with the caption ''Bailey will be your Valentine.'' Warren started toweling off his paws and fur, which were coated in mud and ice from the reservoir, when she seemed to realize that it made more sense to hand this task over to her husband, Bruce Mann. </p><p>  In the kitchen, Warren opened a cupboard to reveal an array of boxes and canisters of tea. She drinks many cups a day (her favorite morning blend is English breakfast). Pouring us each a mug, she said, ''This is a fantasy.'' She was talking about the enormous platform she has, now that she's running for president, to propagate policy proposals that she has been thinking about for decades. ''It's this moment of being able to talk about these ideas, and everybody says, 'Oh, wait, I better pay attention to this.''' She went on: ''It's not about me; it's about those ideas. We've moved the Overton window'' -- the range of ideas deemed to merit serious consideration -- ''on how we think about taxes. And I think, I think we're about to move it on child care.''</p><p>  Her plan, announced in January, would raise $2.75 trillion in revenue over 10 years through a 2 percent tax on assets over $50 million and a higher rate for billionaires. Warren wants to use some of that money to pay for universal child care on a sliding scale. As she talked, she shifted around in her chair -- her hands, her arms, her whole body leaning forward and moving back. Onstage, including at TV town halls, she prefers to stand and pace rather than sit (she tries to record six miles a day on her Fitbit), and sometimes she comes across as a little frenetic, like a darting bird. One on one, though, she seemed relaxed, intent.</p><p>  Warren moved to Cambridge in 1995 when she took a tenured job at Harvard Law School, and 11 years later, Mann, who is a legal historian, got a job there, too. By then they had bought their house; Warren's two children from a previous marriage, her daughter, Amelia, and son, Alexander, were already grown. The first floor is impeccable, with a formal living room -- elegant decorative boxes arranged on a handsome coffee table -- a cozy sunroom and a gleaming kitchen with green tile countertops. When Warren taught classes at Harvard, she would invite her students over for barbecue and peach cobbler during the semester. Some of them marveled at the polish and order, which tends not to be the norm in faculty homes. Warren says she scoops up dog toys before people come over.</p><p>  For her entire career, Warren's singular focus has been the growing fragility of America's middle class. She made the unusual choice as a law professor to concentrate relentlessly on data, and the data that alarms her shows corporate profits creeping up over the last 40 years while employees' share of the pie shrinks. This shift occurred, Warren argues, because in the 1980s, politicians began reworking the rules for the market to the specifications of corporations that effectively owned the politicians. In Warren's view of history, ''The constant tension in a democracy is that those with money will try to capture the government to turn it to their own purposes.'' Over the last four decades, people with money have been winning, in a million ways, many cleverly hidden from view. That's why economists have estimated that the wealthiest top 0.1 percent of Americans now own nearly as much as the bottom 90 percent.</p><p>  As a presidential candidate, Warren has rolled out proposal after proposal to rewrite the rules again, this time on behalf of a majority of American families. On the trail, she says ''I have a plan for that'' so often that it has turned into a T-shirt slogan. Warren has plans (about 20 so far, detailed and multipart) for making housing and child care affordable, forgiving college-loan debt, tackling the opioid crisis, protecting public lands, manufacturing green products, cracking down on lobbying in Washington and giving workers a voice in selecting corporate board members. Her grand overarching ambition is to end America's second Gilded Age.</p><p>  [Elizabeth Warren has lots of plans. Together, they would remake the economy.]</p><p>  ''Ask me who my favorite president is,'' Warren said. When I paused, she said, ''Teddy Roosevelt.'' Warren admires Roosevelt for his efforts to break up the giant corporations of his day -- Standard Oil and railroad holding companies -- in the name of increasing competition. She thinks that today that model would increase hiring and productivity. Warren, who has called herself ''a capitalist to my bones,'' appreciated Roosevelt's argument that trustbusting was helpful, not hostile, to the functioning of the market and the government. She brought up his warning that monopolies can use their wealth and power to strangle democracy. ''If you go back and read his stuff, it's not only about the economic dominance; it's the political influence,'' she said.</p><p>  What's crucial, Roosevelt believed, is to make the market serve ''the public good.'' Warren puts it like this: ''It's structural change that interests me. And when I say structural, the point is to say if you get the structures right, then the markets start to work to produce value across the board, not just sucking it all up to the top.''</p><p>  But will people respond? Warren has been a politician for only seven years, since she announced her run for the Senate in 2011 at age 62. She's still thinking through how she communicates her ideas with voters. ''The only thing that worries me is I won't describe it in a way that -- '' she trailed off. ''It's like teaching class. 'Is everybody in here getting this?' And that's what I just struggle with all the time. How do I get better at this? How do I do more of this in a way that lets people see it, hear it and say, 'Oh, yeah.'''</p><p>  In the months after Donald Trump's stunning victory in 2016, Warren staked out territory as a fierce opponent of the president's who saw larger forces at play in her party's defeat. While many Democratic leaders focused on Trump himself as the problem, Warren gave a series of look-in-the-mirror speeches. In the first, to the executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on Nov. 10, she said that although there could be ''no compromise'' on standing up to Trump's bigotry, millions of Americans had voted for him ''despite the hate'' -- out of their deep frustration with ''an economy and a government that doesn't work for them.'' Later that month, she gave a second speech behind closed doors to a group that included wealthy liberal donors and went hard at her fellow Democrats for bailing out banks rather than homeowners after the 2008 financial crisis. In another speech, in February 2017, to her ideological allies in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Warren said: ''No matter how extreme Republicans in Washington became, Democrats might grumble or whine, but when it came time for action, our party hesitated and pushed back only with great reluctance. Far too often, Democrats have been unwilling to get out there and fight.''</p><p>  Warren fought in those early months by showing up at the Women's March and at Logan Airport in Boston to protest Trump's travel ban. On the Senate floor, opposing the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Trump's first attorney general, she read a letter by Coretta Scott King criticizing Sessions for his record of suppressing the black vote in Alabama, and Republican leaders rebuked her and ordered her to stop. The moment became a symbol of the resistance, with the feminist meme ''Nevertheless, She Persisted,'' a quote from the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, defending the move to silence her. Warren helped take down Trump's first choice for labor secretary, the fast-food magnate Andy Puzder (he called his own employees the ''bottom of the pool''), and she called for an investigation of the Trump administration's botched recovery efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>  But somewhere along the way to announcing her candidacy, Warren's influence faded. She was no longer the kingmaker or queenmaker whose endorsement Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders avidly sought during their 2016 primary battle. When Warren failed to endorse Sanders, the left saw her decision as an act of betrayal, accusing her of propping up the Democratic establishment instead of trying to take it down. (When I asked Warren if she had regrets, she said she wasn't going to revisit 2016.) Sanders emerged as the standard-bearer of the emboldened progressive movement.</p><p>  Trump, meanwhile, was going after Warren by using the slur ''Pocahontas'' to deride her self-identification in the 1980s and '90s as part Native American. In the summer of 2018, he said that if she agreed to take a DNA test in the middle of a televised debate, he would donate $1 million to her favorite charity. Warren shot back on Twitter by condemning Trump's practice of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border (''While you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas''). But a few months later, she released a video saying she had done the DNA analysis, and it showed that she had distant Native American ancestry. The announcement backfired, prompting gleeful mockery from Trump (''I have more Indian blood than she has!'') and sharp criticism from the Cherokee Nation, who faulted her for confusing the issue of tribal membership with blood lines. Warren apologized, but she seemed weaker for having taken Trump's bait.</p><p>  Sanders is still the Democratic candidate with a guru's following and a magic touch for small-donor fund-raising, the one who can inspire some 4,500 house parties in a single weekend. And he has used his big policy idea, Medicare for All, to great effect, setting the terms of debate on the future of health care in his party.</p><p>  With four more years of Trump on the line, though, it's Joe Biden -- the party's most known quantity -- who is far out in front in the polls. Challenging Biden from the left, Warren and Sanders are not calling wealthy donors or participating in big-money fund-raisers. Sanders has been leading Warren in the polls, but his support remains flat, while her numbers have been rising, even besting his in a few polls in mid-June. Warren and Sanders are old friends, which makes it awkward when her gain is assumed to be his loss. Early in June, an unnamed Sanders adviser ridiculed Warren's electability by calling her DNA announcement a ''debacle'' that ''killed her,'' according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. A couple of weeks before the first Democratic primary debates, on June 26 and 27, I asked her what it was like to run against a friend. ''You know, I don't think of this as competing,'' she responded. It was the least plausible thing she said to me.</p><p>  In March, Warren demonstrated her appetite for challenging the economic and political dominance of corporate titans by going directly at America's biggest tech companies. In a speech in Long Island City, Queens -- where local protesters demanded that Amazon drop its plan to build a big new campus -- Warren connected the companies' success at smothering start-up rivals to their influence in Washington. She remarked dryly that the large amounts that businesses like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple spend on lobbying is a ''good return on investment if they can keep Washington from enforcing the antitrust laws.'' She wants to use those laws to break up the companies instead -- a move that no other major American politician had proposed.</p><p>  After Warren started talking about the four tech giants, along with other critics, the Trump administration let it be known that it was scrutinizing them for potential antitrust violations. Conservatives have suspected social media platforms of bias against them for years, and with concerns about privacy violations escalating, big tech was suddenly a bipartisan target. Warren has specifics about how to reduce their influence; she wants to undo the mergers that allowed Facebook, for example, to snap up WhatsApp, rather than compete with it for users. Warren could unleash the power to bring major antitrust prosecutions without Congress -- an answer to gridlock in Washington that's crucially woven into some of her other plans too. (Warren also favors ending the filibuster in the Senate.) Warren wants to prevent companies that offer an online marketplace and have annual revenue of $25 billion or more from owning other companies that sell products on that platform. In other words, Amazon could no longer sell shoes and diapers and promote them over everyone else's shoes and diapers -- giving a small business a fair chance to break in.</p><p>  ''There's a concerted effort to equate Warren with Bernie, to make her seem more radical,'' says Luigi Zingales, a University of Chicago economist and co-host of the podcast Capitalisn't. But Wall Street and its allies ''are more afraid of her than Bernie,'' Zingales continued, ''because when she says she'll change the rules, she's the one who knows how to do it.''</p><p>  Warren's theory of American capitalism rests on two turning points in the 20th century. The first came in the wake of the Great Depression, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt seized the chance to protect workers and consumers from future economic collapse. While the New Deal is mostly remembered for creating much of the nation's social safety net, Warren also emphasizes the significance of the legislation (like the Glass-Steagall Act) that Democrats passed to rein in bankers and lenders and the agencies (the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) that they put in place to enforce those limits. Warren credits this new regulatory regime, along with labor unions, with producing a golden era for many workers over the next four and a half decades. Income rose along with union membership, and 70 percent of the increase went to the bottom 90 percent. That shared prosperity built, in Warren's telling, ''the greatest middle class the world had ever known.''</p><p>  Then came Warren's second turning point: President Ronald Reagan's assault on government. Warren argues that Reagan's skill in the 1980s at selling the country on deregulation allowed the safeguards erected in the 1930s to erode. Republicans seized on the opening Reagan created, and Democrats at times aided them. (Bill Clinton signed the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999.) That's how the country arrived at its current stark level of inequality. ''The system is as rigged as we think,'' Warren wrote in her 2017 book ''This Fight Is Our Fight'' -- in a riposte to Barack Obama, who insisted it was not, even as he recognized the influence of money in politics. This, Warren believes, is what Trump, who also blasted a rigged system, got right and what the Democratic establishment -- Obama, both Clintons, Biden -- gets wrong.</p><p>  The challenge for Warren, going up against Trump, is that his slogan ''drain the swamp'' furthers the longstanding Republican goal of discrediting government, whereas Warren criticizes government as ''a tool for the wealthy and well connected,'' while asking voters to believe that she can remake it to help solve their problems. Hers is the trickier, paradoxical sell.</p><p>  Warren faces a similar challenge when she tries to address the fear some white voters have that their economic and social status is in decline. Trump directs his supporters to blame the people they see every day on TV if they're watching Fox News: immigrants and condescending liberal elites. Warren takes aim at corporate executives while pressing for class solidarity among workers across race and immigration status. Trump's brand of right-wing populism is on the rise around the world. As more people from the global south move north, it's harder than ever to make the case to all workers that they should unite.</p><p>  It's a classic problem for liberals like Warren: Workers often turn on other workers rather than their bosses and the shadowy forces behind them. ''Populism is such a slippery concept,'' Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University and author of ''The Populist Persuasion: An American History,'' told me. ''The only real test is whether you can be the person who convinces people you understand their resentment against the elites. Trump did enough of that to win. Bernie Sanders has shown he can do it among young people. Can Elizabeth Warren pull it off? I'm not sure.''</p><p>  It's an inconvenient political fact for Warren that she's far more associated with Harvard and Massachusetts, where she has lived for the last 25 years, than with Oklahoma, the childhood home that shaped her and where her three brothers still live and her family's roots are multigenerational. If you include Texas, where Warren lived in her early 20s and for most of her 30s, she spent three formative decades far from the Northeast.</p><p>  When she was growing up, Warren's father worked as a salesman at Montgomery Ward and later as a janitor; neither of her parents went to college. (White women in this group broke for Trump by 61 percent in 2016, and white men supported him by 71 percent.) In the early 1960s, when Warren was 12, her father had a heart attack and lost his job in Oklahoma City. One day, after the family's station wagon was repossessed, her mother put on the one formal dress she owned, walked to an interview at Sears and got a job answering phones for minimum wage. This has become the story that Warren tells in every stump speech. She uses it to identify with people who feel squeezed.</p><p>  There's another story that Warren tells in her book about the implications, for her own life, of her family's brush with financial ruin. Warren was going to George Washington University on a scholarship -- ''I loved college,'' she told me. ''I was having a great time'' -- when an old high school boyfriend, Jim Warren, reappeared in her life.</p><p>  He asked her to marry him and go to Texas, where he had a job at IBM. Warren knew her mother wanted her to say yes. ''It was the whole future, come on,'' she told me. ''I had lived in a family for years that was behind on the mortgage. And a secure future was a good man -- not what you might be able to do on your own.''</p><p>  Warren dropped out of college to move to Houston with her new husband. ''It was either-or,'' she said. Many women who make this choice never go back to school. But Warren was determined to become a teacher, so she persuaded Jim to let her finish college as a commuter student at the University of Houston for $50 a semester. After her graduation, they moved to New Jersey for Jim's next IBM posting, and she started working as a speech therapist for special-needs children.</p><p>  Warren was laid off when she became pregnant, and after her daughter was born, she talked Jim into letting her go to law school at Rutgers University in Newark (this time the cost was $450 a semester). After she had her son, she came to terms with the fact that she wasn't cut out to stay home. ''I wanted to be good at it, but I just wasn't,'' she told me.</p><p>  In the late 1970s, she got a job at the University of Houston law school. She and her husband moved back to Texas. A couple of years later, when their daughter was in elementary school and their son was a toddler, the Warrens divorced. In her book, Warren writes about this from Jim's perspective: ''He had married a 19-year-old girl, and she hadn't grown into the woman we both expected.'' (Jim Warren died in 2003.)</p><p>  A year later, Warren asked Mann, whom she had met at a conference, to marry her. He gave up his job at the University of Connecticut to join her in Houston. At the university, Warren decided to teach practical classes, finance and business. In 1981, she added a bankruptcy class and discovered a question that she wanted to answer empirically: Why were personal bankruptcy rates rising even when the economy was on the upswing?</p><p>  At first, Warren accepted the assumption that people were causing their own financial ruin. Too much ''Tommy, Ralph, Gucci and Prada,'' a story in Newsweek called ''Maxed Out'' later declared. Along with two other scholars, Jay Westbrook and Teresa Sullivan, Warren flew around the country and collected thousands of bankruptcy-court filings in several states. ''I was going to expose these people who were taking advantage of the rest of us by hauling off to bankruptcy and just charging debts that they really could repay,'' she said in a 2007 interview with Harry Kreisler, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley. But Warren, Westbrook and Sullivan found that 90 percent of consumer bankruptcies were due to a job loss, a medical problem or the breakup of a family through divorce or the death of a spouse. ''I did the research, and the data just took me to a totally different place,'' Warren said.</p><p>  That research led to a job at the University of Texas at Austin, despite the doubts some faculty members had about her nonselective university degrees. (Mann worked at Washington University in St. Louis.) They finally managed to get joint appointments at the University of Pennsylvania in 1987, and she stayed there until 1995.</p><p>  During this period, Warren was registered as a Republican. (Earlier, in Texas, she was an independent.) Her political affiliation shifted around the time she began working on bankruptcy in Washington. More than one million families a year were going bankrupt in the mid-'90s, and Congress established the National Bankruptcy Review Commission to suggest how to change the bankruptcy code. The commission's chairman, former Representative Mike Synar of Oklahoma, asked Warren, now at Harvard Law School, to be his chief policy adviser. ''I said, 'No, not a chance, that's political,''' Warren said in her interview with Kreisler. ''I want to be pure. I want to be pristine. I don't want to muddy what I do with political implications.''</p><p>  But Synar persuaded Warren to join his team. It was a critical juncture. Big banks and credit-card companies were pushing Congress to raise the barriers for consumers to file for bankruptcy and harder for families to write off debt. Bill Clinton was president. He had run -- much as Warren is running now -- as a champion of the middle class, but early in his first term he began courting Wall Street. He didn't want to fight the banks.</p><p>  Warren flew back and forth from Boston to Washington and to cities where the commission held hearings. It was her political education, and the imbalance of influence she saw disturbed her. The banks and lenders paid people to go to the hearings, wrote campaign checks and employed an army of lobbyists. People who went bankrupt often didn't want to draw attention to themselves, and by definition, they had no money to fight back.</p><p>  By 1997, Warren had become a Democrat, but she was battling within the party as well as outside it. In particular, she clashed with Joe Biden, then a senator from Delaware. Biden's tiny state, which allowed credit-card companies to charge any interest rate they chose beginning in 1981, would become home to half the national market. Individuals who worked for one giant lender, MBNA, contributed more than $200,000 to Biden's campaigns over the years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Biden strongly supported a bill, a version of which was first introduced in 1998, to make it more expensive to file for bankruptcy and more difficult to leave behind debt. He was unpersuaded by Warren's charts and graphs showing how the change would increase the financial burden on families. ''I am so sick of this self-righteous sheen put on anybody who wants to tighten up bankruptcy,'' Biden said during a Senate hearing in 2001.</p><p>  The bankruptcy battles continued, and when Warren testified against the proposed changes to the bankruptcy code before the Senate in 2005, Biden called her argument ''very compelling and mildly demagogic,'' suggesting that her problem was really with the high interest rates that credit-card companies were allowed to charge. ''But senator,'' Warren answered, ''if you are not going to fix that problem'' -- by capping interest rates -- ''you can't take away the last shred of protection from these families'' that access to bankruptcy offers. The bill passed two months later.</p><p>  Biden's team now argues that he stepped in to win ''important concessions for middle-class families,'' like prioritizing payments for child support and alimony ahead of other debt. When I asked Warren in June about Biden's claim, she pursed her lips, looked out the window, paused for a long beat and said, ''You may want to check the record on that.'' The record shows that Warren's focus throughout was on the plight of families who were going bankrupt and that Biden's was on getting a bill through. He supported tweaking it to make it a little less harmful to those facing bankruptcy, and the changes allowed it to pass.</p><p>  In the years since it became law, the bankruptcy bill has allowed credit-card companies to recover more money from families than they did before. That shift had two effects, Matthew Yglesias argued recently in Vox. As Biden hoped, borrowers over all benefited when the credit-card companies offered slightly lowered interest rates. But as Warren feared, the new law hit people reeling from medical emergencies and other unexpected setbacks. Blocked from filing for bankruptcy, they have remained worse off for years. And a major effort to narrow the path to bankruptcy may have an unintended effect, according to a 2019 working paper released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, by making it harder for the country to recover from a financial crisis.</p><p>  In 2001, a Harvard student named Jessica Pishko, an editor of The Harvard Women's Law Journal, approached Warren about contributing to a special issue. She didn't expect Warren to say yes. Students saw Warren as an example of female achievement but not as a professional feminist. ''She didn't write about anything that could seem girlie,'' Pishko remembers. ''She wasn't your go-to for feminist issues, and she was from that era when you didn't put pictures of your kids on your desk'' to show that you were serious about your work. But Warren wanted to contribute. ''She said: 'I'm doing all this research on bankruptcy, and I want to talk about why that's a women's issue. Can I do that?'''</p><p>  The paper Warren produced, ''What Is a Women's Issue?'' was aggressive and heterodox. In it, she criticized the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund for singling out Biden for praise in its annual report because he championed the Violence Against Women Act, which made it easier to prosecute domestic abusers. Warren thought his support for that law did not compensate for his role in pushing through the bankruptcy legislation, which she believed hurt women far more. ''Why isn't Senator Biden in trouble with grass-roots women's groups all over the country and with the millions of women whose lives will be directly affected by the legislation he sponsors?'' she asked. The answer raised ''a troubling specter of women exercising powerful political influence within a limited scope, such as rape laws or equal educational opportunity statutes.''</p><p>  Warren wanted feminism to be wider in scope and centered on economic injustice. She urged students to take business-law classes. ''If few students interested in women's issues train themselves in commercial areas, the effects of the commercial laws will not be diminished, but there will be few effective advocates around to influence those policy outcomes,'' she wrote. ''If women are to achieve true economic equality, a far more inclusive definition of a women's issue must emerge.''</p><p>  She challenged standard feminist thinking again when she published her first book for a lay audience (written with her daughter), ''The Two-Income Trap,'' in 2003. Warren argued that in the wake of the women's movement of the 1970s, millions of mothers streamed into the workplace without increasing the financial security of their families. Her main point was that a family's additional income, when a second parent went to work, was eaten up by the cost of housing, and by child care, education and health insurance.</p><p>  Conservatives embraced her critique more enthusiastically than liberals. Warren even opposed universal day care for fear of ''increasing the pressure'' to send both parents to work. She has shifted on that point. The child-care proposal she announced this February puts funds into creating high-quality child care but doesn't offer equivalent subsidies to parents who stay home with their children. Warren says she's responding to the biggest needs she now sees. More and more families are squeezed by the cost of child care; not enough of it is high quality; the pay for providers is too low. Warren is framing child care as a collective good, like public schools or roads and bridges.</p><p>  ''The Two-Income Trap'' got Warren onto ''Dr. Phil,'' giving her a taste of minor stardom and the appeal of a larger platform. When the financial crisis hit, she moved to Washington's main stage. At the invitation of Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, Warren led the congressional oversight panel tasked with overseeing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that Congress created to save the financial system. In public hearings, Warren called out Timothy Geithner, Obama's Treasury secretary, for focusing on bailing out banks rather than small businesses and homeowners. Through a spokeswoman, Geithner declined to comment for this article. In his memoir, he called the oversight hearings ''more like made-for-YouTube inquisitions than serious inquiries.''</p><p>  But Warren could see the value of the viral video clip. In 2009, Jon Stewart invited her on ''The Daily Show.'' After throwing up from nerves backstage, she went on air and got a little lost in the weeds -- repeating the abbreviation P.P.I.P. (the Public-Private Investment Program) and at first forgetting what it stood for. She felt as though she blew her opportunity to speak to millions of viewers. Stewart brought her back after the break for five more minutes, and she performed well, clearly explaining how the country forgot the lessons of the Great Depression and the dangers of deregulation. ''We start pulling the threads out of the regulatory fabric,'' Warren said. She listed the upheavals that followed -- the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, the collapse of the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and the Enron scandal a few years later. ''And what is our repeated response?'' Warren said. ''We just keep pulling the threads.'' Now that the government was trying to save the whole economy from falling off the cliff, there were two choices: ''We're going to decide, basically: Hey, we don't need regulation. You know, it's fine, boom and bust, boom and bust, boom and bust, and good luck with your 401(k). Or alternatively, we're going to say, You know, we're going to put in some smart regulations ... and what we're going to have, going forward, is we're going to have stability and some real prosperity for ordinary folks.''</p><p>  Stewart leaned forward and told Warren she had made him feel better than he had in months. ''I don't know what it is that you just did right there, but for a second that was like financial chicken soup for me,'' he said.</p><p>  ''That moment changed my life,'' Warren later said. Stewart kept inviting her back. In 2010, Congress overhauled and tightened financial regulation with the Dodd-Frank Act. In the push for its passage, Warren found that she had the leverage to persuade Democratic leaders to create a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Its job is to safeguard people from malfunctioning financial products (like predatory loans), much as the government protects them from -- to borrow Warren's favorite analogy -- toasters that burst into flames. Warren spent a year setting up the C.F.P.B. When Obama chose Richard Cordray over her as the first director because he had an easier path to Senate confirmation, progressives were furious.</p><p>  Warren was an unusual political phenomenon by then: a policy wonk who was also a force and a symbol. In 2012, she was the natural choice for Democrats recruiting a candidate to run against Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, a Republican who had slipped into office, after Ted Kennedy's death, against a weak opponent. Warren had another viral moment when a supporter released a homemade video of her speaking to a group in Andover. ''You built a factory out there?'' Warren said, defending raising taxes on the wealthy. ''Good for you. But I want to be clear: You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did.'' Brown called Warren ''anti-free enterprise,'' and Obama, running for re-election, distanced himself in an ad shot from the White House (''Of course Americans build their own businesses,'' he said). But Warren's pitch succeeded. She came from behind in the race against Brown and won with nearly 54 percent of the vote.</p><p>  [How the Trump administration dismantled the C.F.P.B.]</p><p>  Voters of color could determine the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the primaries, African-Americans constitute a large share of Democrats in the early-voting state of South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, when many other states vote. In the general election, the path to the presidency for a Democrat will depend in part on turning out large numbers of people of color in Southern states (North Carolina, Virginia, possibly Florida) and also in the Rust Belt, where the post-Obama dip in turnout among African-Americans contributed to Hillary Clinton's squeaker losses in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.</p><p>  Warren has work to do to persuade people of color to support her. In the last couple of Democratic primaries, these voters started out favoring candidates who they thought would be most likely to win, not those who were the most liberal. Black voters backed Hillary Clinton in 2008 until they were sure Barack Obama had enough support to beat her, and in 2016 they stuck with her over Bernie Sanders. This time, they have black candidates -- Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Wayne Messam -- to choose from. And voters of color may be skeptical of Warren's vision of class solidarity transcending racial division. As it turned out, Warren's case that most white people voted for Trump because of economic distress, and ''despite the hate,'' as she said right after the election, didn't really hold up. A study published last year found that among white voters, perceived racial or global threats explained their shift toward Trump better than financial concerns did. What does that say about the chances of winning as a liberal who tries to take the racism out of populism?</p><p>  When Warren makes the case about what needs to change in America by leaning on the period from 1935 to 1980, she's talking about a time of greater economic equality -- but also a period when people of color were excluded from the benefits of government policies that buoyed the white middle class. In a video announcing that she was exploring a presidential bid, Warren acknowledged that history by saying that families of color today face ''a path made even harder by generations of discrimination.'' For example, the federal agency created during the New Deal drew red lines around mostly black neighborhoods on maps to deny mortgage loans to people who lived in them.</p><p>  Warren spoke about this problem years before she went into politics. Redlining contributed to the racial wealth gap, and that had consequences Warren saw in her bankruptcy studies -- black families were more vulnerable to financial collapse. Their vulnerability was further heightened by subprime and predatory lending. In ''The Two-Income Trap,'' Warren called these kinds of loans ''legally sanctioned corporate plans to steal from minorities.''</p><p>  In March, Warren took a three-day trip to the South. She started on a Sunday afternoon, with a town hall -- one of 101 she has done across the country -- at a high school in a mostly black neighborhood in Memphis. It's her format of choice; the questions she fields help sharpen her message. The local politicians who showed up that day were African-American, but most of the crowd was white.</p><p>  The next morning, Warren drove to the MississippiDelta. Her husband, Mann, was on spring break from teaching and along for the trip. Warren's staff welcomes his presence because Warren loves having him with her and because he's willing to chat up voters (who often call him ''Mr. Warren''). In the small town of Cleveland, Miss., Warren sprang out of her black minivan in the parking lot of a church to shake the hand of an African-American state senator, Willie Simmons. They were meeting for the first time: He had agreed to take her on a walking tour after her campaign got in touch and said she wanted to learn about housing in the Delta.</p><p>  Simmons and Warren set off down a block of modest ranch houses, some freshly painted, others peeling, preceded by TV crews and trailed by the rest of the press as her aides darted in to keep us out of the shot. The scrum made conversation stagy, but Simmons gradually eased into answering Warren's questions. He pointed out cracks in the foundations of some houses; the lack of money to repair old buildings was a problem in the Delta. They stopped at a vacant lot. The neighbors wanted to turn it into a playground, but there was no money for that either.</p><p>  Warren nodded and then took a stab at communicating her ideas to the local viewers who might catch a few of her words that night. She hit the highlights of the affordable housing bill she released in the Senate months earlier -- 3.2 million new homes over 10 years, an increase in supply that Moody's estimated would reduce projected rents by 10 percent. When the tour ended, Simmons told the assembled reporters that he didn't know whom he would support for president, but Warren got points for showing up and being easy to talk to -- ''touchable,'' he said.</p><p>  That night, Warren did a CNN town hall at Jackson State University, the third historically black college she has visited this year. Warren moved toward the audience at the first opportunity, walking past the chair placed for her onstage. She laid out the basics of her housing bill, stressing that it addressed the effects of discrimination. ''Not just a passive discrimination,'' Warren said. ''Realize that into the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families.'' Her bill included funds to help people from redlined areas, or who had been harmed by subprime loans, buy houses. The audience applauded.</p><p>  Warren also said that night that she supported a ''national full-blown conversation'' about reparations for slavery and Jim Crow. She saw this as a necessary response to the stark wealth gap between black and white families. ''Today in America -- because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination -- we live in a world where the average white family has $100 and the average black family has about $5.'' Several Democratic candidates have said they support a commission to study reparations. Ta-Nehisi Coates, author of the influential 2014 Atlantic article ''The Case for Reparations,'' said in a recent interview with The New Yorker that Warren was the candidate whose commitment seemed real because she had asked him to talk with her about his article when it came out years ago. ''She was deeply serious,'' Coates said.</p><p>  Warren is often serious and doesn't hesitate to convey her moral outrage. ''I'll own it,'' she told me about her anger. She talked about women expressing to her their distress about sexual harassment and assault. ''Well, yeah,'' Warren said. ''No kidding that a woman might be angry about that. Women have a right to be angry about being treated badly.''</p><p>  Trump gets angry all the time; whether a woman can do the same and win remains a question. Warren's campaign is simultaneously working in another register. On Twitter, it has been posting videos of Warren calling donors who have given as little as $3. They can't believe it's her. When the comedian and actress Ashley Nicole Black tweeted, ''Do you think Elizabeth Warren has a plan to fix my love life?'' Warren tweeted back and then called Black, who finished the exchange with a fan-girl note: ''Guess who's crying and shaking and just talked to Elizabeth Warren on the phone?!?!? We have a plan to get my mom grandkids, it's very comprehensive, and it does involve raising taxes on billionaires.''</p><p>  After Trump's election, Warren and Sanders said that if Trump followed through on his promise to rebuild the economy for workers and their families, they would help. If Trump had championed labor over corporations, he could have scrambled American politics by creating new alliances. But that version of his presidency didn't come to pass. Instead, by waging trade wars that hurt farm states and manufacturing regions more than the rest of the country, Trump has punished his base economically (even if they take satisfaction in his irreverence and his judicial appointments).</p><p>  Warren has been speaking to those voters. In June, she put out an ''economic patriotism'' plan filled with ideas about helping American industries. By stepping into the vacuum for economic populism the president has left, Warren forced a reckoning on Fox News, Trump's safe space on TV, from the host Tucker Carlson. Usually a Trump loyalist, he has recently styled himself a voice for the white working class.</p><p>  Carlson opened his show by using more than two minutes of airtime to quote Warren's analysis of how giant American companies are abandoning American workers. Carlson has warned that immigrants make the country ''poorer and dirtier'' and laced his show with racism, but now he told his mostly Republican viewers: ''Ask yourself, what part of the statement you just heard did you disagree with?'' He continued, ''Here's the depressing part: Nobody you voted for said that or would ever say it.'' The next day, a new conservative Never Trump website called The Bulwark ran a long and respectful essay called ''Why Elizabeth Warren Matters.''</p><p>  A month earlier in Mingo County, W.Va., where more than 80 percent of voters cast a ballot for Trump, Warren went to a local fire station to talk about her plan for addressing the opioid crisis. It's big: She wants to spend $100 billion over 10 years, including $50 million annually for West Virginia, the state with the highest rate of deaths from drug overdoses. In Trump's latest budget, he has requested an increase of $1.5 billion to respond directly to the epidemic. Against a backdrop of firefighters' coats hanging in cinder-block cubbies, Warren moved among a crowd of about 150. Many hands went up when she asked who knew someone struggling with opioids. She brought up the role of ''corporations that made big money off getting people addicted and keeping them addicted.'' People with ''Make America Great Again'' stickers nodded and clapped, according to Politico.</p><p>  If Warren competes for rural voters in the general election (if not to win a red state then to peel off enough of them to make a difference in a purple one), her strong support for abortion rights and gun control will stand in her way. Lately, she has framed her argument for keeping abortion clinics open in economic terms, too. ''Women of means will still have access to abortions,'' she said at a town hall on MSNBC hosted by Chris Hayes of the effects of new state laws aimed at closing clinics. ''Who won't will be poor women, will be working women, will be women who can't afford to take off three days from work, will be very young women.'' She finished by saying, ''We do not pass laws that take away that freedom from the women who are most vulnerable.''</p><p>  Biden and Sanders have been polling better with non-college-educated white voters than Warren has. David Axelrod, the former Obama strategist and political commentator, thinks that even if her ideas resonate, she has yet to master the challenge of communicating with this group. ''She's lecturing,'' he said. ''There's a lot of resistance, because people feel like she's talking down to them.''</p><p>  Warren didn't sound to me like a law professor on the trail, but she did sound like a teacher. Trying to educate people isn't the easiest way to connect with them. ''Maybe she could bring it down a level,'' Lola Sewell, a community organizer in Selma, Ala., suggested. ''A lot of us aren't involved with Wall Street and those places.''</p><p>  Warren may also confront a double bind for professional women: To command respect, they have to prove that they're experts, but once they do, they're often seen as less likable. At one point, I asked Warren whether there was anything good about running for president as a woman. ''It is what it is,'' she said.</p><p>  When I first talked with Warren in February, when her poll numbers were low, I wondered whether she was content with simply forcing Democratic candidates to engage with her ideas. During the 2016 primaries, when Warren did not endorse Sanders, she wanted influence over Hillary Clinton's economic appointments should she win the presidency. Cleaving the Democratic administration from Wall Street -- that was enough at the time. She could make a similar decision in 2020 or try to get her own appointment. If Warren became Treasury secretary, she could resuscitate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Trump has worked to declaw, and tip all kinds of decisions away from banks and toward the families who come to her town halls and tell her about the loans they can't pay.</p><p>  By mid-June, however, when I went to Washington to talk to Warren for the last time, she was very much in the race. New polls showed her in second place in California and Nevada. She had more to lose, and perhaps as a result, her answers were more scripted, more like her speeches.</p><p>  Warren, like everyone in the race, has yet to prove that she has the political skills and broad-enough support to become president. But a parallel from another country suggests that perhaps bearing down on policy is the best strategy against right-wing populism. Luigi Zingales, the University of Chicago economist, comes from Italy, and he feared Trump's rise back in 2011, having watched the ascension of Silvio Berlusconi, the corrupt billionaire tycoon who was elected prime minister of Italy in the 2000s as a right-wing populist. After Trump's victory in 2016, Zingales pointed out in a New York Times Op-Ed that the two candidates who defeated Berlusconi treated him as ''an ordinary opponent,'' focusing on policy issues rather than his character. ''The Democratic Party should learn this lesson,'' Zingales wrote. He now thinks that Warren is positioned to mount that kind of challenge. ''I think so,'' he said, ''if she does not fall for his provocations.''</p><p>  Warren and I met in her Washington apartment. The floor at the entrance had been damaged by a leak in the building, and the vacuum cleaner was standing next to the kitchen counter. I said I was a bit relieved by the slight disarray because her house in Cambridge was so supremely uncluttered, and she burst out laughing. She sat on the couch as we spoke about the indignities to come, the way in which her opponents -- Biden, Trump, who knew who else -- would try to make her unrecognizable to herself. What would she do about that? Warren leaned back and stretched her feet out, comfortable in gray wool socks. ''The answer is, we've got time,'' she said. ''I'll just keep talking to people -- I like talking to people.''</p><p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Warren at a rally in May at Laney College in Oakland, Calif.

She told it over and over across the state of Iowa on Memorial Day weekend. You could find the repetition a sign that she's on autopilot, but in person, the opposite effect comes across: that this story is so important that she can't afford to get a detail wrong. Her approach is chock-full of policy, sure; \"I've got a plan for that\" has become a rallying cry. Her flurry of proposals-for a wealth tax that would fund free public college and universal child care and pre-K, for a \"Green Marshall Plan,\" for canceling student debt, and for fighting the opioid crisis-is earning her headlines and driving her recent success with voters. In a national <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Economist</emphasis>/YouGov <url normalizedValue=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/4etmv6wq62/econToplines.pdf\">poll</url> in mid-June, she grabbed second place in the Democratic primary field, behind former vice president Joe Biden and ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. In a Monmouth       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nv_061219.pdf/\">poll</url> of Nevada, the third state to vote in the Democratic primaries next year, she also climbed to second place, and in the latest <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Des Moines Register</emphasis>/CNN       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2019/06/09/iowa-poll-biden-leads-democrats-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg-caucus-2020/1360801001/\">poll</url> for Iowa, she was effectively tied with Sanders for second place. No doubt she's helped by having the largest staff of all the Democrats; she has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html\">more than 50 people</url> on the ground in Iowa, where I watched six meticulously executed events.</p><p/><p>But I'd argue that Warren's newly tight and coherent story, in which her life's arc tracks the country's, is contributing to her rise, in part because it protects her against other stories-the nasty ones told by her opponents, first, and then echoed by the media doubters influenced by her opponents. Her big national-stage debut came when she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-five-flash-points-of-the-long-simmering-obama-warren-feud/446433/\">tangled</url> with Barack Obama's administration over bank bailouts, then set up the powerhouse Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). But she was dismissed as too polarizing, even by some Democrats, and was passed over to run it. In 2012, Massachusetts's Scott Brown       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/the-professor-slur-44119619707\">mocked</url> Warren as \"the Professor,\" a know-it-all Harvard schoolmarm, before she beat him to take his Senate seat. After that, Donald Trump began       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/why-trump-keeps-calling-elizabeth-warren-pocahontas-1513307195-dfbd4f53-fd10-4480-be25-1471ed199e4e.html\">trashing</url> her as \"Pocahontas\" in the wake of a controversy on the campaign trail about her mother's rumored Native American roots. And Warren scored an own goal with a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1051783184390664192?lang=en\">video</url> that announced she had \"confirmed\" her Native heritage with a DNA test, a claim that ignored the brutal history of blood-quantum requirements and genetic pseudoscience in the construction of race.</p><p>When she announced her presidential run this year, some national political reporters <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/elizabeth-warren-unlikable-women-in-politics\">raised questions</url> about her       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/06/no-its-not-sexist-to-call-elizabeth-warren-unlikable/\">likability</url>, finding new ways to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/31/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clinton-1077008\">compare</url> her to Hillary Clinton, another female candidate widely dismissed as unlikable. A month into Warren's campaign, it seemed the media was poised to Clintonize her off the primary stage. But it turned out she had a plan for that, too.</p><p>n the tale that is captivating crowds on the campaign trail, Warren is not a professor or a political star but a hardscrabble Oklahoma \"late-in-life baby\" or, as her mother called her, \"the surprise.\" Her elder brothers had joined the military; she was the last one at home, just a middle-schooler when her father had the massive heart attack that would cost him his job. \"I remember the day we lost the station wagon,\" she tells crowds, lowering her voice. \"I learned the words 'mortgage' and 'foreclosure'\u200a\" listening to her parents talk when they thought she was asleep, she recalls. One day she walked in on her mother in her bedroom, crying and saying over and over, \"\u200a'We are not going to lose this house.' She was 50 years old,\" Warren adds, \"had never worked outside the home, and she was terrified.\"</p><p>This part of the story has been a Warren staple for years: Her mother put on her best dress and her high heels and walked down to a Sears, where she got a minimum-wage job. Warren got a private lesson from her mother's sacrifice-\"You do what you have to to take care of those you love\"-and a political one, too. \"That minimum-wage job saved our house, and it saved our family.\" In the 1960s, she says, \"a minimum-wage job could support a family of three. Now the minimum wage can't keep a momma and a baby out of poverty.\"</p><p>That's Act I of Warren's story and of the disappearing American middle class whose collective story her family's arc symbolizes. In Act II, she walks the crowd through her early career, including some personal choices that turned her path rockier: early marriage, dropping out of college. But her focus now is on what made it possible for her to rise from the working class. Warren tells us how she went back to school and got her teaching certificate at a public university, then went to law school at another public university. Both cost only a few hundred dollars in tuition a year. She always ends with a crowd-pleaser: \"My daddy ended up as a janitor, but his baby daughter got the opportunity to become a public-school teacher, a law professor, a US senator, and run for president!\"</p><p>Warren has honed this story since her 2012 Senate campaign. Remember her \"Nobody in this country got rich on his own\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htX2usfqMEs\">speech</url>? It was an explanation of how the elite amassed wealth thanks to government investments in roads, schools, energy, and police protection, which drew more than 1 million views on YouTube. Over the years, she has become the best explainer of the way the US government, sometime around 1980, flipped from building the middle class to protecting the wealthy. Her 2014 book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fighting Chance</emphasis>, explains how Warren (once a Republican, like two of her brothers) saw her own family's struggle in the stories of those families whose bankruptcies she studied as a lawyer-families she once thought might have been slackers. Starting in 1989, with a book she cowrote on bankruptcy and consumer credit, her writing has charted the way government policies turned against the middle class and toward corporations. That research got her tapped by then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4411837/elizabeth-warren-statement-tarp-oversight\">oversee</url> the Troubled Assets Relief Program after the 2008 financial crash and made her       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ecpfjd/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-elizabeth-warren-pt--1\">a favorite</url> on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daily Show With Jon Stewart</emphasis>. Starting in the mid-2000s, she publicly clashed with prominent Democrats,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/the-2020-race-could-revive-a-bitter-feud-between-joe-biden-and-elizabeth-warren/\">including Biden</url>, a senator at the time, over bankruptcy reforms, and later with then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner over the bank bailouts.</p><p>Sanders, of course, has a story too, about a government that works for the \"millionaires and billionaires.\" But he has a hard time connecting his family's stories of struggle to his policies. After his first few campaign events, he ditched the details about growing up poor in Brooklyn. In early June, he returned to his personal story in a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/opinion/bernie-sanders-trump.html\">op-ed</url>.</p><p>arren preaches the need for \"big structural change\" so often that a crowd chanted the phrase back at her during a speech in San Francisco the first weekend in June. Then she gets specific. In Act III of her stump speech, she lays out her dizzying array of plans. But by then they're not dizzying, because she has anchored them to her life and the lives of her listeners. The rapport she develops with her audience, sharing her tragedies and disappointments-questionable choices and all-makes her bold policy pitches feel believable. She starts with her proposed wealth tax: two cents on every dollar of your worth after $50\u00a0million, which she says would raise $2.75\u00a0trillion over 10 years. (She has also proposed a 7 percent surtax on corporate profits above $100 million.)</p><p>Warren sells the tax with a vivid, effective comparison. \"How many of you own a home?\" she asks. At most of her stops in Iowa, it was roughly half the crowd. \"Well, you already pay a wealth tax on your major asset. You pay a property tax, right?\" People start nodding. \"I just want to make sure we're also taxing the diamonds, the Rembrandts, the yachts, and the stock portfolios.\" Nobody in those Iowa crowds seemed to have a problem with that. Then she lays out <url normalizedValue=\"http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/saez-zucman-wealthtax-warren.pdf\">the shocking fact</url> that people in the top 1 percent pay roughly 3.2 percent of their wealth in taxes, while the bottom 99 percent pay 7.4 percent.</p><p>That \"big structural change\" would pay for the items on Warren's agenda- the programs that would rebuild the opportunity ladder to the middle class-that have become her signature: free technical school or two- or four-year public college; at least partial loan forgiveness for 95 percent of those with student debt; universal child care and prekindergarten, with costs capped at 7 percent of family income; and a pay hike for child-care workers.</p><p>\"Big structural change\" would also include strengthening unions and giving workers 40 percent of the seats on corporate boards. Warren promises to break up Big Tech and Big Finance. She calls for a constitutional amendment to protect the right to vote and vows to push to overturn <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Citizens United</emphasis>. To those who say it's too much, she ends every public event the same way: \"What do you think they said to the abolitionists? 'Too hard!' To the suffragists fighting to get women the right to vote? 'Too hard!' To the foot soldiers of the civil-rights movement, to the activists who wanted equal marriage? 'Give up now!'\u200a\" But none of them gave up, she adds, and she won't either. Closing that way, she got a standing ovation at every event I attended.</p><p>ecently, Warren has incorporated into her pitch the stark differences between what mid-20th-century government offered to black and white Americans. This wasn't always the case. After a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQAxWCawY8s\">speech</url> she delivered at the Roosevelt Institute in 2015, I heard black audience members complain about her whitewashed version of the era when government built the (white) middle class. Many black workers were ineligible for Social Security; the GI Bill       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.demos.org/blog/how-gi-bill-left-out-african-americans\">didn't prohibit racial discrimination</url>; and federal loan guarantees systematically excluded black home buyers and black neighborhoods. \"I love Elizabeth, but those stories about the '50s drive me crazy,\" one black progressive said.</p><p>The critiques must have made their way to Warren. Ta-Nehisi Coates recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/ta-nehisi-coates-revisits-the-case-for-reparations\">told</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Yorker</emphasis> that after his influential <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Atlantic</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">essay</url> \"The Case for Reparations\" appeared five years ago, the Massachusetts senator asked to meet with him. \"She had read it. She was deeply serious, and she had questions.\" Now, when Warren talks about the New Deal, she is quick to mention the ways African Americans were shut out. Her fortunes on the campaign trail brightened after April's She the People       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRLdH4NCXqg\">forum</url> in Houston, where she joined eight other candidates in talking to what the group's founder, Aimee Allison, calls \"the real Democratic base\": women of color, many from the South. California's Kamala Harris, only the second African-American woman ever elected to the US Senate, might have had the edge coming in, but Warren surprised the crowd. \"She walked in to polite applause and walked out to a standing ovation,\" Allison said, after the candidate impressed the crowd with policies to address black maternal-health disparities, the black-white wealth gap, pay inequity, and more.</p><p>But the key moment that afternoon, Allison recalled, didn't have to do with a policy or a plan. \"At one point, she turned and looked at the audience and said, 'I know no one here was ever handed anything.' And you could feel these women shift in their seats. They felt seen.\" Last year, Allison added, she was invited to speak with Warren about her top issues, and the candidate \"really listened.\" Karine Jean-Pierre of MoveOn said it's clear Warren has listened to black policy analysts. \"She the People was the moment for me when she really began to resonate,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"Black women especially want to know, 'Are you coming for our votes, or are you coming to change our lives?'\u200a\"</p><p>Watching Warren in Iowa, I realized I'd never before seen a white politician drill white crowds on the structural white supremacy that persisted after the Jim Crow era. When she said in rural Salem that for every $100 of wealth held by a white family, black families have $5, a stocky white man in a trucker hat let out a loud \"Whew!\" She won applause from white Iowa audiences for promising that her housing policies will prioritize helping areas where redlining or predatory lending historically diminished black wealth.</p><p>he reporters who joined Warren on her six-city Iowa tour tried to get her to talk about her rivals, but Warren made it clear she was not there to criticize other Democrats. She was regularly asked about her relationship with Sanders-at one stop, about whether it bothered her they're often mentioned in the same breath. \"I'm happy to be mentioned by Democratic voters in any breath,\" she joked. She was invited to criticize Biden's reliance on big donors but declined. \"The people of Iowa will decide how they feel about it,\" she said at one point.</p><p>In an interview with Warren, I noted that Democratic debate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/democratic-debate-rules/591550/\">rules</url> (distributing top-tier candidates over two nights) would up denying her a showdown with Biden in the first debate over the bankruptcy legislation he supported in 2005. What would she like to hear from him on such topics today? She doesn't bite. \"I can't characterize Joe Biden's approach. He needs to do that.... You know how I look at it. You've seen how I look at it. This is not something new. I didn't just glue on a bunch of policies. This is what I've worked on for my whole life.</p><p>\"But it is the case that I see a government that increasingly works for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaves everyone else behind. Until we take that on and break the stranglehold that the obscenely rich and powerful hold over our country, we can't straighten out much of anything else.\"</p><p>I noted that she had worked in Obama's administration for a while and that, for all the good he did, he didn't break that stranglehold, either. Why? She paused. \"I tangled publicly with the administration over trade and over the regulation of big banks. Tim Geithner and I\"-here she chuckled-\"had battles that spilled onto the public stage.\" In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fighting Chance</emphasis>, she laments, \"The president chose his team, and the president's team chose Wall Street.\" But now she defended Obama, arguing simply, \"Barack Obama stood up for the consumer agency when a lot of folks in his administration didn't want to, when others were willing to throw it under the bus.\"</p><p>Warren's face brightened when she talked about the early days of the CFPB. \"When he asked me to come set up the agency, it was a delight. Partly to be able to build something from scratch, but something that would matter, and to know that the president of the United States stood behind it.\" Still, there was tension over whether she would formally run the agency she'd set up, with many officials, including Democrats, insisting that she couldn't be confirmed by the Senate. I asked how much she cared about leading it. \"Oh, I would have stayed if they let me,\" she said right away.</p><p>Did that mean she thought Obama could have fought harder to get her through, even by using a recess appointment if she couldn't be confirmed by the Senate? \"Nah,\" she said, shaking her head. \"At the end of the day, he made the calculation that the agency needed a director who was confirmed, not a recess appointment. And I understand that.... He wanted it to be strong. Part of what was happening was Republicans were changing the ground rules right underneath him.\" Indeed, in 2011, the Republicans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-gop-blocks-possible-elizabeth-warren-recess-appointment/\">blocked</url> her appointment to head the CFPB; in 2016, they kept a Supreme Court seat open for a full year to block Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland.</p><p>espite this, Biden <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/joe-biden-republican-epiphany-trump.html\">claimed</url> last month that once Trump leaves office, \"you will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends,\" and they'll start to work with Democrats again. Warren seemed to respond in a barn burner of a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-candidates-take-subtle-digs-at-biden-2019-6\">speech</url> in San Francisco, saying, \"Some say that if we just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses. But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over.\" In their specificity, ambition, and sheer number, Warren's policy proposals lead the 2020 pack. So far, her plans have largely been greeted with enthusiasm by progressive policy experts-but not all. While her wealth tax is broadly popular (in a February <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Politico</emphasis>/Morning Consult poll, more than 60 percent of voters said they back it, including half of Republicans), it has drawn some criticism from progressive economists on practical and ideological grounds. \"Even the best-designed tax can be gamed,\" Dean Baker, a cofounder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://cepr.net/publications/op-eds-columns/progressive-taxes-only-go-so-far-pre-tax-income-is-the-problem\">wrote</url> shortly after she announced her plan. \"Gaming the tax system will mean that we will collect considerably less revenue than a static projection would imply... From an economic standpoint, this is a complete waste.\" He and others also argue that a wealth tax is less important than changing the laws that enable the rich to earn such enormous sums in the first place.</p><p>When I asked her about the skeptics, Warren shot back, \"They've probably been listening to talking points from a handful of billionaires.\" In her view, enforcement is possible. A wealth tax would apply \"to all property around the world. We have a growing number of countries with reciprocal trade agreements to disclose property. I've built into the proposal stepped-up enforcement, experts at tracking down this property,\" she continued. \"You really want to say on something like this, 'It's just too hard'? Two cents from the top one-tenth of the 1\u00a0percent, we can cover child care, universal pre-K, universal college, cut student-loan debt for 95 percent, still have nearly half a trillion left over. It's the kind of structural change we need in this economy, and we don't need to hear from a bunch of billionaires that it's too hard. And you know what? If it's too hard, we'll just take it on, and we'll fix it.\"</p><p>Kevin Carey, a higher-education expert at New America, is the most prominent critic of her proposal for tuition-free technical colleges and public universities. In an <url normalizedValue=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/04/25/what-elizabeth-warrens-free-college-plan-gets-wrong/\">article</url> in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Monthly</emphasis>, he argued that by failing to incentivize states to spend more of their funds on public higher education, Warren's plan would take \"the vast disparities and injustices of the existing higher-education funding system and permanently bake them in place, punishing the states already doing the most to support students\"-such as North Carolina, which spends $10,400 per student annually-\"and rewarding the ones doing the least.\" When I asked her about that criticism, Warren didn't entirely reject it, but she made clear that putting forward the fundamental message of free higher ed for all was her primary goal. \"We have a responsibility to open up opportunity for everyone, whether they live in North Carolina or Pennsylvania or anywhere in this country. We actually wrestled with this problem,\" she added, \"because I understand the concern.... It doesn't happen on the first day, but there will be an equalizing in terms of [state] investment. But step one is: Let's tell every high-school senior, let's tell everyone who dropped out of school after a year or two because they couldn't see taking on more debt, let's tell everyone who now has two little kids and a dead-end job and sees the chance of an education as opening a door...let's tell them all that they can go to a technical college or a two-year college or a four-year college.\"</p><p>On Medicare for All, Warren, like some other 2020 progressives, appears to be trying to have it all. Although she is a cosponsor of Sanders's bill, which would phase out virtually all private insurance in four years, she prefers to talk on the stump about going after \"the lower-hanging fruit\": negotiating lower prescription-drug prices and then moving certain groups onto Medicare. \"There are a lot of ways you can do it,\" she told a crowd in Burlington, Iowa. \"You can expand who's eligible. Enroll the folks over 50. Some say enroll everybody under 30, because they cost less. You can give employers the option to buy in.\" I watched Senator Kirsten Gillibrand do the same thing in Iowa: pitch Medicare for All as something that would be such a good deal, folks would be clamoring to enroll. But after four years, enrollment under Sanders's plan would not be voluntary, and the 180\u00a0million Americans who get their insurance through their employers may oppose giving up that insurance in so short a time.</p><p>When I asked Warren whether there was a conflict between her approach and Sanders's, she said, \"I don't think so. I have supported multiple approaches, so long as we're keeping our eye on the center: that we need care for everyone at the lowest possible cost. And I'm firmly committed to Medicare as having demonstrated that it's the best way to get that done. But we gotta pull everybody to the table. The unions need to be at the table.\" Did she have qualms about the four-year time frame? \"I don't have any qualms. This is about the ways that we identify where we're headed and the different paths we have for getting there. You know, I meet with people all across the country, and they tell me about going without medication, about not going to the doctor, about rural hospitals closing. All of those are real and tangible costs, and they mean we gotta get there fast. So I don't want to undercut any notion that we want to do this quickly. We are committed, and we will get this done. But we gotta get everybody to the table to talk about it and to be on board.\"</p><p>Warren's position on Medicare for All has drawn criticism from the Vermont senator's devotees. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/06/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-health-care-policy\">piece</url> in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jacobin</emphasis> headlined \"Elizabeth Warren Has a Plan for Everything-Except Health Care\" criticized her for simultaneously supporting the Sanders approach and incremental steps. But in dozens of interviews with Iowans, the only negative comments I heard about her platform had to do with Medicare for All-from people fearing that Sanders's plan would go too far too fast. In Oskaloosa, former Marion County Democratic Party chair Phyllis Weeks, who is 80, told me she loved Warren but was still not supporting anyone, partly over concerns about progressive candidates' support for the Sanders bill.</p><p>n Burlington, I saw Warren depart from her script for the first time, addressing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/03/720043317/the-mississippi-river-has-been-flooding-for-41-days-now\">flood conditions</url> along parts of the Mississippi. From the 90-year-old brick warehouse that housed the city's welcome center, she pointed outside to rows of sandbags lining the swollen river. \"Farmers here can't put their crops in the ground,\" she said, shortly after a disaster-aid bill was blocked in Congress by a lone legislator, Representative Chip Roy (R-TX). \"That is a broken Washington, and we need to change it.\" Then she hit her standard stump speech. Just after she wrapped up, a tornado-warning siren began to blare. Warren calmly continued to take selfies with everyone standing in line for one while her anxious staff checked weather reports. Once she made it through the line, they whisked her into a windowless room, inviting along the stranded reporters covering her.</p><p>If one measure of \"presidential\" is whether someone is reassuring in a crisis, Warren met that test. She told stories of hiding in a bathtub during Oklahoma's frequent tornado scares, assuring us she had never seen one touch down. \"The real issue here might be flooding,\" she said as she walked out into a storm of biblical proportions to record a video about how climate change is leading to extreme weather. Eventually the rains stopped, the flooding receded, and we all drove away. But five days later, the building we had been in flooded. While reporting in Iowa, I interviewed Oskaloosans at a backyard party with mud between my toes, and in Salem, I made my way to Warren's events ankle deep in wet hay. Although it went for Trump in 2016, Iowa might be primed to vote for a Democrat who makes the climate crisis a priority in 2020.</p><p>But first, Iowans will caucus. They'll have many choices, but Warren, who has visited the state six times so far, is betting they'll choose her. There is some concern that her fund-raising, which lags behind other top-tier candidates'-in part because she's refusing to do big-donor events-might not sustain a large national organization. Warren said she's not worried. \"This is our chance to build a grassroots movement, and that happens one person at a time,\" she said. \"I'm running the race I want to run.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-316965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF1-S4X1-DXR3-24V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Jun 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Much of her to-do list includes disallowing tech giants that own a marketplace from also participating in that marketplace. That means Amazon wouldn't be able to sell its own products on Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There are a few ways Warren's policies could affect the e-commerce behemoth, especially concerning Amazon's Alexa hardware, its grocery businesses, and Amazon Web Services.</p><p> But the most obvious effect \u2014 no more selling AmazonBasics and other Amazon private label merchandise on Amazon Marketplace \u2014 is one that the company shouldn't fight. Amazon should stop selling Amazon private label products on Amazon Marketplace because its proportionally small loss would be a disproportionately huge gain for small businesses.</p><p> On Amazon Marketplace, users can discover and purchase items from third-party sellers. This works out great for pretty much everyone: sellers can easily reach customers, Amazon gets a cut of the sale, and a healthy marketplace keeps prices low for consumers. Capitalism at its finest.</p><p> But the problem that Warren and others have is that Amazon has introduced its own products \u2014 including its AmazonBasics line \u2014 into that marketplace.</p><p> 2) Also interesting: under the Warren plan, Amazon Basics and Marketplace would be spun off from core Amazon, but I don't see anything about AWS (the most profitable piece of Amazon, and the one with the most anti-competitive potential because competitors' services run on it).</p><p> \u2014 Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) March 8, 2019</p><p>Amazon launched AmazonBasics, a line of everyday products like batteries and cookware, in 2009. It has been growing its private labels ever since, constructing more than 100 fashion, home, and electronics brands in the last 10 years. In 2017, private label brands accounted for $450 million in sales. And in July 2018, analysts estimated that private labels would account for $7.5 billion in sales in 2018. (Amazon has not yet released its 2018 annual report.) Amazon sells its private label products in its Marketplace, right alongside nearly identical products from independent sellers.</p><p> Critics, including anti-trust rockstar Lina Khan, have a problem with this.</p><p> \"If you're going to be a dominant marketplace, then you perhaps shouldn't be able to also sell on that market place, putting yourself in direct competition with all the merchants that are dependent,\" Khan recently said on the NPR podcast Planet Money.</p><p> Khan, and now Warren, take the position that both selling in and owning the marketplace gives Amazon an unfair competitive advantage. They think Amazon's unique business model lets it trounce the competition in a few ways that go beyond a store like CVS selling CVS products. The New York Times outlined most of these advantages in an investigation entitled \"How Amazon steers shoppers to its own products,\" where it found:</p><p> *</p><p>Amazon uses the data it gets from third-party sellers to help determine what it actually sells.</p><p> *</p><p> It provides advantageous product placement for its own products over its competitors.</p><p> *</p><p> Its status as a mega-corporation enables it to sell products at cheaper prices than its competitors.</p><p> *</p><p> Sellers are dependent on the marketplace, so they cannot effectively take their services elsewhere.</p><p>Amazon told Planet Money that its private label brands ultimately create value for the consumer by making prices even lower. But those low prices for consumers come at the expense of third-party sellers.</p><p>Amazon likes to tout its ability to help small businesses find customers. However, propping up its private labels fundamentally undercuts this value proposition. If Amazon wants to defend the value that it provides to both consumers and small businesses, it should let its private labels go without a fight.</p><p> In Amazon's statement to Planet Money, the spokesperson also states that private labels account for a \"tiny\" proportion of Amazon's business. That's true: In 2018, Amazon reported doing $232.9 billion in net sales. And whaddya know, $7.5 billion in private label sales is just 3.2 percent of that. That's Bezos chump change.</p><p> Spinning off AmazonBasics wouldn't kill Amazon. But the growth of AmazonBasics could kill small businesses.</p><p> Besides, $7.5 billion fewer dollars going to Amazon wouldn't mean much financially to the company, by their own admission  \u2014 but it would potentially mean billions going to the independent hat makers, novelty sweater sellers, and gadget companies peddling their wares on Amazon.</p><p>Amazon has so, so few opportunities to be the good guy: Jeff Bezos is literally the richest man there has ever been, and is considered a ruthless capitalist making his billions on the backs of underpaid and abused workers. If regulation in tech is coming, and it most certainly is, this is one area in which it might actually be best for Amazon \u2014 in terms of goodwill, and the health of its Marketplace business as a whole \u2014 to concede.</p><p> Spinning off AmazonBasics wouldn't kill Amazon. But the growth of AmazonBasics could kill small businesses. Political pressure on tech giants is growing. To engender support from politicians, small businesses, and customers, Amazon should back off its private labels, and put those billions in product sales back on the table for its Marketplace sellers.</p><p> Is it so hard to imagine Amazon bowing out of the product business with grace? Unfortunately, yes. Amazon launched an under-the-radar private label accelerator program in 2018, which was partially responsible for the explosion in its brands and private label sales, so this is a big area of growth for the company. Analysts also say that brands like AmazonBasics could bring in $25 billion by 2022. That's close to what Amazon's most profitable arm, Amazon Web Services, brings in today ($25.6 billion).</p><p> Then again, if Warren gets her way, Amazon might not have a choice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff Bezos has rarely been one willing to part with a few billion.

It was a sunny day in February, a couple of weeks after Warren <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">announced her candidacy</url> for president, and she was wearing a navy North Face jacket and black sneakers with, as usual, rimless glasses and small gold earrings. Her hair had drifted a bit out of place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dog, Bailey, is a golden retriever who had already been deployed by her presidential campaign <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">in a tweet</url> a week earlier, a pink-tongued snapshot with the caption \u201cBailey will be your Valentine.\u201d Warren started toweling off his paws and fur, which were coated in mud and ice from the reservoir, when she seemed to realize that it made more sense to hand this task over to her husband, Bruce Mann.</p><p>In the kitchen, Warren opened a cupboard to reveal an array of boxes and canisters of tea. She drinks many cups a day (her favorite morning blend is English breakfast). Pouring us each a mug, she said, \u201cThis is a fantasy.\u201d She was talking about the enormous platform she has, now that she\u2019s running for president, to propagate policy proposals that she has been thinking about for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s this moment of being able to talk about these ideas, and everybody says, \u2018Oh, wait, I better pay attention to this.\u2019\u201d She went on: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about those ideas. We\u2019ve moved the Overton window\u201d \u2014 the range of ideas deemed to merit serious consideration \u2014 \u201con how we think about taxes. And I think, I think we\u2019re about to move it on child care.\u201d</p><p>Her plan, announced in January, would raise $2.75 trillion in revenue over 10 years through a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">2 percent tax on assets over $50 million</url> and a higher rate for billionaires. Warren wants to use some of that money to pay for universal child care on a sliding scale. As she talked, she shifted around in her chair \u2014 her hands, her arms, her whole body leaning forward and moving back. Onstage, including at TV town halls, she prefers to stand and pace rather than sit (she tries to record six miles a day on her Fitbit), and sometimes she comes across as a little frenetic, like a darting bird. One on one, though, she seemed relaxed, intent.</p><p>Warren moved to Cambridge in 1995 when she took a tenured job at Harvard Law School, and 11 years later, Mann, who is a legal historian, got a job there, too. By then they had bought their house; Warren\u2019s two children from a previous marriage, her daughter, Amelia, and son, Alexander, were already grown. The first floor is impeccable, with a formal living room \u2014 elegant decorative boxes arranged on a handsome coffee table \u2014 a cozy sunroom and a gleaming kitchen with green tile countertops. When Warren taught classes at Harvard, she would invite her students over for barbecue and peach cobbler during the semester. Some of them marveled at the polish and order, which tends not to be the norm in faculty homes. Warren says she scoops up dog toys before people come over.</p><p>For her entire career, Warren\u2019s singular focus has been the growing fragility of America\u2019s middle class. She made the unusual choice as a law professor to concentrate relentlessly on data, and the data that alarms her shows corporate profits creeping up over the last 40 years while employees\u2019 share of the pie shrinks. This shift occurred, Warren argues, because in the 1980s, politicians began reworking the rules for the market to the specifications of corporations that effectively owned the politicians. In Warren\u2019s view of history, \u201cThe constant tension in a democracy is that those with money will try to capture the government to turn it to their own purposes.\u201d Over the last four decades, people with money have been winning, in a million ways, many cleverly hidden from view. That\u2019s why economists have estimated that the wealthiest top 0.1 percent of Americans now own nearly as much as the bottom 90 percent.</p><p>As a presidential candidate, Warren has rolled out proposal after proposal to rewrite the rules again, this time on behalf of a majority of American families. On the trail, she says \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d so often that it has turned into a T-shirt slogan. Warren has plans (about 20 so far, detailed and multipart) for making housing and child care affordable, forgiving college-loan debt, tackling the opioid crisis, protecting public lands, manufacturing green products, cracking down on lobbying in Washington and giving workers a voice in selecting corporate board members. Her grand overarching ambition is to end America\u2019s second Gilded Age.</p><p>[Elizabeth Warren had big ambitions as a girl growing up in Oklahoma. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">It wasn\u2019t easy.</url>]</p><p>\u201cAsk me who my favorite president is,\u201d Warren said. When I paused, she said, \u201cTeddy Roosevelt.\u201d Warren admires Roosevelt for his efforts to break up the giant corporations of his day \u2014 Standard Oil and railroad holding companies \u2014 in the name of increasing competition. She thinks that today that model would increase hiring and productivity. Warren, who has called herself \u201ca capitalist to my bones,\u201d appreciated Roosevelt\u2019s argument that trustbusting was helpful, not hostile, to the functioning of the market and the government. She brought up his warning that monopolies can use their wealth and power to strangle democracy. \u201cIf you go back and read his stuff, it\u2019s not only about the economic dominance; it\u2019s the political influence,\u201d she said.</p><p>What\u2019s crucial, Roosevelt believed, is to make the market serve \u201cthe public good.\u201d Warren puts it like this: \u201cIt\u2019s structural change that interests me. And when I say structural, the point is to say if you get the structures right, then the markets start to work to produce value across the board, not just sucking it all up to the top.\u201d</p><p>But will people respond? Warren has been a politician for only seven years, since she announced her run for the Senate in 2011 at age 62. She\u2019s still thinking through how she communicates her ideas with voters. \u201cThe only thing that worries me is I won\u2019t describe it in a way that \u2014 \u201d she trailed off. \u201cIt\u2019s like teaching class. \u2018Is everybody in here getting this?\u2019 And that\u2019s what I just struggle with all the time. How do I get better at this? How do I do more of this in a way that lets people see it, hear it and say, \u2018Oh, yeah.\u2019\u201d</p><p>In the months after Donald Trump\u2019s stunning victory in 2016, Warren staked out territory as a fierce opponent of the president\u2019s who saw larger forces at play in her party\u2019s defeat. While many Democratic leaders focused on Trump himself as the problem, Warren gave a series of look-in-the-mirror speeches. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">the first</url>, to the executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on Nov. 10, she said that although there could be \u201cno compromise\u201d on standing up to Trump\u2019s bigotry, millions of Americans had voted for him \u201cdespite the hate\u201d \u2014 out of their deep frustration with \u201can economy and a government that doesn\u2019t work for them.\u201d Later that month, she gave       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">a second speech</url> behind closed doors to a group that included wealthy liberal donors and went hard at her fellow Democrats for bailing out banks rather than homeowners after the 2008 financial crisis. In       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">another speech</url>, in February 2017, to her ideological allies in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Warren said: \u201cNo matter how extreme Republicans in Washington became, Democrats might grumble or whine, but when it came time for action, our party hesitated and pushed back only with great reluctance. Far too often, Democrats have been unwilling to get out there and fight.\u201d</p><p>Warren fought in those early months by showing up at the Women\u2019s March and at Logan Airport in Boston to protest Trump\u2019s travel ban. On the Senate floor, opposing the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Trump\u2019s first attorney general, she read a letter by Coretta Scott King criticizing Sessions for his record of suppressing the black vote in Alabama, and Republican leaders rebuked her and ordered her to stop. The moment became a symbol of the resistance, with the feminist meme \u201cNevertheless, She Persisted,\u201d a quote from the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, defending the move to silence her. Warren helped take down Trump\u2019s first choice for labor secretary, the fast-food magnate Andy Puzder (he called his own employees the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">\u201cbottom of the pool\u201d</url>), and she called for an investigation of the Trump administration\u2019s botched recovery efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>But somewhere along the way to announcing her candidacy, Warren\u2019s influence faded. She was no longer the kingmaker or queenmaker whose endorsement Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders avidly sought during their 2016 primary battle. When Warren failed to endorse Sanders, the left saw her decision as an act of betrayal, accusing her of propping up the Democratic establishment instead of trying to take it down. (When I asked Warren if she had regrets, she said she wasn\u2019t going to revisit 2016.) Sanders emerged as the standard-bearer of the emboldened progressive movement.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, was going after Warren by using the slur \u201cPocahontas\u201d to deride her self-identification in the 1980s and \u201990s as part Native American. In the summer of 2018, he said that if she agreed to take a DNA test in the middle of a televised debate, he would donate $1 million to her favorite charity. Warren shot back on Twitter by condemning Trump\u2019s practice of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border (\u201cWhile you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas\u201d). But a few months later, she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">released a video</url> saying she had done the DNA analysis, and it showed that she had distant Native American ancestry. The announcement       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">backfired</url>, prompting gleeful mockery from Trump (\u201cI have more Indian blood than she has!\u201d) and sharp criticism from the Cherokee Nation, who faulted her for confusing the issue of tribal membership with blood lines.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">Warren apologized</url>, but she seemed weaker for having taken Trump\u2019s bait.</p><p>Sanders is still the Democratic candidate with a guru\u2019s following and a magic touch for small-donor fund-raising, the one who can inspire some 4,500 house parties in a single weekend. And he has used his big policy idea, Medicare for All, to great effect, setting the terms of debate on the future of health care in his party.</p><p>With four more years of Trump on the line, though, it\u2019s Joe Biden \u2014 the party\u2019s most known quantity \u2014 who is far out in front <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">in the polls</url>. Challenging Biden from the left, Warren and Sanders are not calling wealthy donors or participating in big-money fund-raisers. Sanders has been leading Warren in the polls, but his support remains flat, while her numbers have been rising, even besting his in a few polls in mid-June. Warren and Sanders are old friends, which makes it awkward when her gain is assumed to be his loss. Early in June, an unnamed Sanders adviser       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">ridiculed Warren\u2019s electability</url> by calling her DNA announcement a \u201cdebacle\u201d that \u201ckilled her,\u201d according to U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report. A couple of weeks before the first Democratic primary debates, on June 26 and 27, I asked her what it was like to run against a friend. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think of this as competing,\u201d she responded. It was the least plausible thing she said to me.</p><p>In March, Warren demonstrated her appetite for challenging the economic and political dominance of corporate titans by going directly at America\u2019s biggest tech companies. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">a speech</url> in Long Island City, Queens \u2014 where local protesters demanded that Amazon drop its plan to build a big new campus \u2014 Warren connected the companies\u2019 success at smothering start-up rivals to their influence in Washington. She remarked dryly that the large amounts that businesses like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple spend on lobbying is a \u201cgood return on investment if they can keep Washington from enforcing the antitrust laws.\u201d She wants to use those laws to break up the companies instead \u2014 a move that no other major American politician had proposed.</p><p>After Warren started talking about the four tech giants, along with other critics, the Trump administration let it be known that it was scrutinizing them for potential antitrust violations. Conservatives have suspected social media platforms of bias against them for years, and with concerns about privacy violations escalating, big tech was suddenly a bipartisan target. Warren has specifics about how to reduce their influence; she wants to undo the mergers that allowed Facebook, for example, to snap up WhatsApp, rather than compete with it for users. Warren could unleash the power to bring major antitrust prosecutions without Congress \u2014 an answer to gridlock in Washington that\u2019s crucially woven into some of her other plans too. (Warren also favors ending the filibuster in the Senate.) Warren wants to prevent companies that offer an online marketplace and have annual revenue of $25 billion or more from owning other companies that sell products on that platform. In other words, Amazon could no longer sell shoes and diapers and promote them over everyone else\u2019s shoes and diapers \u2014 giving a small business a fair chance to break in.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a concerted effort to equate Warren with Bernie, to make her seem more radical,\u201d says Luigi Zingales, a University of Chicago economist and co-host of the podcast <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">Capitalisn\u2019t</url>. But Wall Street and its allies \u201care more afraid of her than Bernie,\u201d Zingales continued, \u201cbecause when she says she\u2019ll change the rules, she\u2019s the one who knows how to do it.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s theory of American capitalism rests on two turning points in the 20th century. The first came in the wake of the Great Depression, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt seized the chance to protect workers and consumers from future economic collapse. While the New Deal is mostly remembered for creating much of the nation\u2019s social safety net, Warren also emphasizes the significance of the legislation (like the Glass-Steagall Act) that Democrats passed to rein in bankers and lenders and the agencies (the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) that they put in place to enforce those limits. Warren credits this new regulatory regime, along with labor unions, with producing a golden era for many workers over the next four and a half decades. Income rose along with union membership, and 70 percent of the increase went to the bottom 90 percent. That shared prosperity built, in Warren\u2019s telling, \u201cthe greatest middle class the world had ever known.\u201d</p><p>Then came Warren\u2019s second turning point: President Ronald Reagan\u2019s assault on government. Warren argues that Reagan\u2019s skill in the 1980s at selling the country on deregulation allowed the safeguards erected in the 1930s to erode. Republicans seized on the opening Reagan created, and Democrats at times aided them. (Bill Clinton signed the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999.) That\u2019s how the country arrived at its current stark level of inequality. \u201cThe system is as rigged as we think,\u201d Warren wrote in her 2017 book <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">\u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight\u201d</url> \u2014 in a riposte to Barack Obama, who insisted it was not, even as he recognized the influence of money in politics. This, Warren believes, is what Trump, who also blasted a rigged system, got right and what the Democratic establishment \u2014 Obama, both Clintons, Biden \u2014 gets wrong.</p><p>The challenge for Warren, going up against Trump, is that his slogan \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d furthers the longstanding Republican goal of discrediting government, whereas Warren criticizes government as \u201ca tool for the wealthy and well connected,\u201d while asking voters to believe that she can remake it to help solve their problems. Hers is the trickier, paradoxical sell.</p><p>Warren faces a similar challenge when she tries to address the fear some white voters have that their economic and social status is in decline. Trump directs his supporters to blame the people they see every day on TV if they\u2019re watching Fox News: immigrants and condescending liberal elites. Warren takes aim at corporate executives while pressing for class solidarity among workers across race and immigration status. Trump\u2019s brand of right-wing populism is on the rise around the world. As more people from the global south move north, it\u2019s harder than ever to make the case to all workers that they should unite.</p><p>It\u2019s a classic problem for liberals like Warren: Workers often turn on other workers rather than their bosses and the shadowy forces behind them. \u201cPopulism is such a slippery concept,\u201d Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University and author of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">\u201cThe Populist Persuasion: An American History,\u201d</url> told me. \u201cThe only real test is whether you can be the person who convinces people you understand their resentment against the elites. Trump did enough of that to win. Bernie Sanders has shown he can do it among young people. Can Elizabeth Warren pull it off? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an inconvenient political fact for Warren that she\u2019s far more associated with Harvard and Massachusetts, where she has lived for the last 25 years, than with Oklahoma, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">the childhood home that shaped her</url> and where her three brothers still live and her family\u2019s roots are multigenerational. If you include Texas, where Warren lived in her early 20s and for most of her 30s, she spent three formative decades far from the Northeast.</p><p>When she was growing up, Warren\u2019s father worked as a salesman at Montgomery Ward and later as a janitor; neither of her parents went to college. (White women in this group <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">broke for Trump by 61 percent</url> in 2016, and white men supported him by 71 percent.) In the early 1960s, when Warren was 12, her father had a heart attack and lost his job in Oklahoma City. One day, after the family\u2019s station wagon was repossessed, her mother put on the one formal dress she owned, walked to an interview at Sears and got a job answering phones for minimum wage. This has become the story that Warren tells in every stump speech. She uses it to identify with people who feel squeezed.</p><p>There\u2019s another story that Warren tells in her book about the implications, for her own life, of her family\u2019s brush with financial ruin. Warren was going to George Washington University on a scholarship \u2014 \u201cI loved college,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was having a great time\u201d \u2014 when an old high school boyfriend, Jim Warren, reappeared in her life.</p><p>He asked her to marry him and go to Texas, where he had a job at IBM. Warren knew her mother wanted her to say yes. \u201cIt was the whole future, come on,\u201d she told me. \u201cI had lived in a family for years that was behind on the mortgage. And a secure future was a good man \u2014 not what you might be able to do on your own.\u201d</p><p>Warren dropped out of college to move to Houston with her new husband. \u201cIt was either-or,\u201d she said. Many women who make this choice never go back to school. But Warren was determined to become a teacher, so she persuaded Jim to let her finish college as a commuter student at the University of Houston for $50 a semester. After her graduation, they moved to New Jersey for Jim\u2019s next IBM posting, and she started working as a speech therapist for special-needs children.</p><p>Warren was laid off when she became pregnant, and after her daughter was born, she talked Jim into letting her go to law school at Rutgers University in Newark (this time the cost was $450 a semester). After she had her son, she came to terms with the fact that she wasn\u2019t cut out to stay home. \u201cI wanted to be good at it, but I just wasn\u2019t,\u201d she told me.</p><p>In the late 1970s, she got a job at the University of Houston law school. She and her husband moved back to Texas. A couple of years later, when their daughter was in elementary school and their son was a toddler, the Warrens divorced. In her book, Warren writes about this from Jim\u2019s perspective: \u201cHe had married a 19-year-old girl, and she hadn\u2019t grown into the woman we both expected.\u201d (Jim Warren died in 2003.)</p><p>A year later, Warren asked Mann, whom she had met at a conference, to marry her. He gave up his job at the University of Connecticut to join her in Houston. At the university, Warren decided to teach practical classes, finance and business. In 1981, she added a bankruptcy class and discovered a question that she wanted to answer empirically: Why were personal bankruptcy rates rising even when the economy was on the upswing?</p><p>At first, Warren accepted the assumption that people were causing their own financial ruin. Too much \u201cTommy, Ralph, Gucci and Prada,\u201d a story in Newsweek called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">\u201cMaxed Out\u201d</url> later declared. Along with two other scholars, Jay Westbrook and Teresa Sullivan, Warren flew around the country and collected thousands of bankruptcy-court filings in several states. \u201cI was going to expose these people who were taking advantage of the rest of us by hauling off to bankruptcy and just charging debts that they really could repay,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview with Harry Kreisler, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley. But Warren, Westbrook and Sullivan found that 90 percent of consumer bankruptcies were due to a job loss, a medical problem or the breakup of a family through divorce or the death of a spouse. \u201cI did the research, and the data just took me to a totally different place,\u201d Warren said.</p><p>That research led to a job at the University of Texas at Austin, despite the doubts some faculty members had about her nonselective university degrees. (Mann worked at Washington University in St. Louis.) They finally managed to get joint appointments at the University of Pennsylvania in 1987, and she stayed there until 1995.</p><p>During this period, Warren was registered as a Republican. (Earlier, in Texas, she was an independent.) Her political affiliation shifted around the time she began working on bankruptcy in Washington. More than one million families a year were going bankrupt in the mid-\u201990s, and Congress established the National Bankruptcy Review Commission to suggest how to change the bankruptcy code. The commission\u2019s chairman, former Representative Mike Synar of Oklahoma, asked Warren, now at Harvard Law School, to be his chief policy adviser. \u201cI said, \u2018No, not a chance, that\u2019s political,\u2019\u201d Warren said in her interview with Kreisler. \u201cI want to be pure. I want to be pristine. I don\u2019t want to muddy what I do with political implications.\u201d</p><p>But Synar persuaded Warren to join his team. It was a critical juncture. Big banks and credit-card companies were pushing Congress to raise the barriers for consumers to file for bankruptcy and harder for families to write off debt. Bill Clinton was president. He had run \u2014 much as Warren is running now \u2014 as a champion of the middle class, but early in his first term he began courting Wall Street. He didn\u2019t want to fight the banks.</p><p>Warren flew back and forth from Boston to Washington and to cities where the commission held hearings. It was her political education, and the imbalance of influence she saw disturbed her. The banks and lenders paid people to go to the hearings, wrote campaign checks and employed an army of lobbyists. People who went bankrupt often didn\u2019t want to draw attention to themselves, and by definition, they had no money to fight back.</p><p>By 1997, Warren had become a Democrat, but she was battling within the party as well as outside it. In particular, she clashed with Joe Biden, then a senator from Delaware. Biden\u2019s tiny state, which allowed credit-card companies to charge any interest rate they chose beginning in 1981, would become home to half the national market. Individuals who worked for one giant lender, MBNA, contributed more than $200,000 to Biden\u2019s campaigns over the years, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</url>. Biden strongly supported a bill, a version of which was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">first introduced in 1998</url>, to make it more expensive to file for bankruptcy and more difficult to leave behind debt. He was unpersuaded by Warren\u2019s charts and graphs showing how the change would increase the financial burden on families. \u201cI am so sick of this self-righteous sheen put on anybody who wants to tighten up bankruptcy,\u201d Biden said during a Senate hearing in 2001.</p><p>The bankruptcy battles continued, and when Warren testified against the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">proposed changes to the bankruptcy code</url> before the Senate in 2005, Biden called her argument \u201cvery compelling and mildly demagogic,\u201d suggesting that her problem was really with the high interest rates that credit-card companies were allowed to charge. \u201cBut senator,\u201d Warren answered, \u201cif you are not going to fix that problem\u201d \u2014 by capping interest rates \u2014 \u201cyou can\u2019t take away the last shred of protection from these families\u201d that access to bankruptcy offers. The bill passed two months later.</p><p>Biden\u2019s team now argues that he stepped in to win \u201cimportant concessions for middle-class families,\u201d like prioritizing payments for child support and alimony ahead of other debt. When I asked Warren in June about Biden\u2019s claim, she pursed her lips, looked out the window, paused for a long beat and said, \u201cYou may want to check the record on that.\u201d The record shows that Warren\u2019s focus throughout was on the plight of families who were going bankrupt and that Biden\u2019s was on getting a bill through. He supported tweaking it to make it a little less harmful to those facing bankruptcy, and the changes allowed it to pass.</p><p>In the years since it became law, the bankruptcy bill has allowed credit-card companies to recover more money from families than they did before. That shift had two effects, Matthew Yglesias argued recently in Vox. As Biden hoped, borrowers over all benefited when the credit-card companies offered slightly lowered interest rates. But as Warren feared, the new law hit people reeling from medical emergencies and other unexpected setbacks. Blocked from filing for bankruptcy, they have remained worse off for years. And a major effort to narrow the path to bankruptcy may have an unintended effect, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">2019 working paper</url> released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, by making it harder for the country to recover from a financial crisis.</p><p>In 2001, a Harvard student named Jessica Pishko, an editor of The Harvard Women\u2019s Law Journal, approached Warren about contributing to a special issue. She didn\u2019t expect Warren to say yes. Students saw Warren as an example of female achievement but not as a professional feminist. \u201cShe didn\u2019t write about anything that could seem girlie,\u201d Pishko remembers. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t your go-to for feminist issues, and she was from that era when you didn\u2019t put pictures of your kids on your desk\u201d to show that you were serious about your work. But Warren wanted to contribute. \u201cShe said: \u2018I\u2019m doing all this research on bankruptcy, and I want to talk about why that\u2019s a women\u2019s issue. Can I do that?\u2019\u201d</p><p>The paper Warren produced, \u201cWhat Is a Women\u2019s Issue?\u201d was aggressive and heterodox. In it, she criticized the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund for singling out Biden for praise in its annual report because he championed the Violence Against Women Act, which made it easier to prosecute domestic abusers. Warren thought his support for that law did not compensate for his role in pushing through the bankruptcy legislation, which she believed hurt women far more. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Senator Biden in trouble with grass-roots women\u2019s groups all over the country and with the millions of women whose lives will be directly affected by the legislation he sponsors?\u201d she asked. The answer raised \u201ca troubling specter of women exercising powerful political influence within a limited scope, such as rape laws or equal educational opportunity statutes.\u201d</p><p>Warren wanted feminism to be wider in scope and centered on economic injustice. She urged students to take business-law classes. \u201cIf few students interested in women\u2019s issues train themselves in commercial areas, the effects of the commercial laws will not be diminished, but there will be few effective advocates around to influence those policy outcomes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf women are to achieve true economic equality, a far more inclusive definition of a women\u2019s issue must emerge.\u201d</p><p>She challenged standard feminist thinking again when she published her first book for a lay audience (written with her daughter), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">\u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d</url> in 2003. Warren argued that in the wake of the women\u2019s movement of the 1970s, millions of mothers streamed into the workplace without increasing the financial security of their families. Her main point was that a family\u2019s additional income, when a second parent went to work, was eaten up by the cost of housing, and by child care, education and health insurance.</p><p>Conservatives embraced her critique more enthusiastically than liberals. Warren even opposed universal day care for fear of \u201cincreasing the pressure\u201d to send both parents to work. She has shifted on that point. The child-care proposal she announced this February puts funds into creating high-quality child care but doesn\u2019t offer equivalent subsidies to parents who stay home with their children. Warren says she\u2019s responding to the biggest needs she now sees. More and more families are squeezed by the cost of child care; not enough of it is high quality; the pay for providers is too low. Warren is framing child care as a collective good, like public schools or roads and bridges.</p><p>\u201cThe Two-Income Trap\u201d got Warren onto \u201cDr. Phil,\u201d giving her a taste of minor stardom and the appeal of a larger platform. When the financial crisis hit, she moved to Washington\u2019s main stage. At the invitation of Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, Warren led the congressional oversight panel tasked with overseeing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that Congress created to save the financial system. In public hearings, Warren called out Timothy Geithner, Obama\u2019s Treasury secretary, for focusing on bailing out banks rather than small businesses and homeowners. Through a spokeswoman, Geithner declined to comment for this article. In his memoir, he called the oversight hearings \u201cmore like made-for-YouTube inquisitions than serious inquiries.\u201d</p><p>But Warren could see the value of the viral video clip. In 2009, Jon Stewart invited her on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d After throwing up from nerves backstage, she went on air and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">got a little lost in the weeds</url> \u2014 repeating the abbreviation P.P.I.P. (the Public-Private Investment Program) and at first forgetting what it stood for. She felt as though she blew her opportunity to speak to millions of viewers. Stewart brought her back after the break for five more minutes, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">she performed well</url>, clearly explaining how the country forgot the lessons of the Great Depression and the dangers of deregulation. \u201cWe start pulling the threads out of the regulatory fabric,\u201d Warren said. She listed the upheavals that followed \u2014 the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, the collapse of the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and the Enron scandal a few years later. \u201cAnd what is our repeated response?\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe just keep pulling the threads.\u201d Now that the government was trying to save the whole economy from falling off the cliff, there were two choices: \u201cWe\u2019re going to decide, basically: Hey, we don\u2019t need regulation. You know, it\u2019s fine, boom and bust, boom and bust, boom and bust, and good luck with your 401(k). Or alternatively, we\u2019re going to say, You know, we\u2019re going to put in some smart regulations ... and what we\u2019re going to have, going forward, is we\u2019re going to have stability and some real prosperity for ordinary folks.\u201d</p><p>Stewart leaned forward and told Warren she had made him feel better than he had in months. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is that you just did right there, but for a second that was like financial chicken soup for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat moment changed my life,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">Warren later said</url>. Stewart kept inviting her back. In 2010, Congress overhauled and tightened financial regulation with the Dodd-Frank Act. In the push for its passage, Warren found that she had the leverage to persuade Democratic leaders to create a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Its job is to safeguard people from malfunctioning financial products (like predatory loans), much as the government protects them from \u2014 to borrow Warren\u2019s favorite analogy \u2014 toasters that burst into flames. Warren spent a year setting up the C.F.P.B. When Obama chose Richard Cordray over her as the first director because he had an easier path to Senate confirmation, progressives were furious.</p><p>Warren was an unusual political phenomenon by then: a policy wonk who was also a force and a symbol. In 2012, she was the natural choice for Democrats recruiting a candidate to run against Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, a Republican who had slipped into office, after Ted Kennedy\u2019s death, against a weak opponent. Warren had another viral moment when a supporter released a homemade video of her speaking to a group in Andover. \u201cYou built a factory out there?\u201d Warren said, defending raising taxes on the wealthy. \u201cGood for you. But I want to be clear: You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn\u2019t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did.\u201d Brown called Warren \u201canti-free enterprise,\u201d and Obama, running for re-election, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">distanced himself in an ad</url> shot from the White House (\u201cOf course Americans build their own businesses,\u201d he said). But Warren\u2019s pitch succeeded. She came from behind in the race against Brown and won with nearly 54 percent of the vote.</p><p>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">How the Trump administration dismantled the C.F.P.B.</url>]</p><p>Voters of color could determine the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the primaries, African-Americans constitute a large share of Democrats in the early-voting state of South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, when many other states vote. In the general election, the path to the presidency for a Democrat will depend in part on turning out large numbers of people of color in Southern states (North Carolina, Virginia, possibly Florida) and also in the Rust Belt, where the post-Obama dip in turnout among African-Americans contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s squeaker losses in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.</p><p>Warren has work to do to persuade people of color to support her. In the last couple of Democratic primaries, these voters started out favoring candidates who they thought would be most likely to win, not those who were the most liberal. Black voters backed Hillary Clinton in 2008 until they were sure Barack Obama had enough support to beat her, and in 2016 they stuck with her over Bernie Sanders. This time, they have black candidates \u2014 Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Wayne Messam \u2014 to choose from. And voters of color may be skeptical of Warren\u2019s vision of class solidarity transcending racial division. As it turned out, Warren\u2019s case that most white people voted for Trump because of economic distress, and \u201cdespite the hate,\u201d as she said right after the election, didn\u2019t really hold up. A study published last year found that among white voters, perceived racial or global threats explained their shift toward Trump better than financial concerns did. What does that say about the chances of winning as a liberal who tries to take the racism out of populism?</p><p>When Warren makes the case about what needs to change in America by leaning on the period from 1935 to 1980, she\u2019s talking about a time of greater economic equality \u2014 but also a period when people of color were excluded from the benefits of government policies that buoyed the white middle class. In a video announcing that she was exploring a presidential bid, Warren acknowledged that history by saying that families of color today face \u201ca path made even harder by generations of discrimination.\u201d For example, the federal agency created during the New Deal drew red lines around mostly black neighborhoods on maps to deny mortgage loans to people who lived in them.</p><p>Warren spoke about this problem years before she went into politics. Redlining contributed to the racial wealth gap, and that had consequences Warren saw in her bankruptcy studies \u2014 black families were more vulnerable to financial collapse. Their vulnerability was further heightened by subprime and predatory lending. In \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d Warren called these kinds of loans \u201clegally sanctioned corporate plans to steal from minorities.\u201d</p><p>In March, Warren took a three-day trip to the South. She started on a Sunday afternoon, with a town hall \u2014 one of 101 she has done across the country \u2014 at a high school in a mostly black neighborhood in Memphis. It\u2019s her format of choice; the questions she fields help sharpen her message. The local politicians who showed up that day were African-American, but most of the crowd was white.</p><p>The next morning, Warren drove to the MississippiDelta. Her husband, Mann, was on spring break from teaching and along for the trip. Warren\u2019s staff welcomes his presence because Warren loves having him with her and because he\u2019s willing to chat up voters (who often call him \u201cMr. Warren\u201d). In the small town of Cleveland, Miss., Warren sprang out of her black minivan in the parking lot of a church to shake the hand of an African-American state senator, Willie Simmons. They were meeting for the first time: He had agreed to take her on a walking tour after her campaign got in touch and said she wanted to learn about housing in the Delta.</p><p>Simmons and Warren set off down a block of modest ranch houses, some freshly painted, others peeling, preceded by TV crews and trailed by the rest of the press as her aides darted in to keep us out of the shot. The scrum made conversation stagy, but Simmons gradually eased into answering Warren\u2019s questions. He pointed out cracks in the foundations of some houses; the lack of money to repair old buildings was a problem in the Delta. They stopped at a vacant lot. The neighbors wanted to turn it into a playground, but there was no money for that either.</p><p>Warren nodded and then took a stab at communicating her ideas to the local viewers who might catch a few of her words that night. She hit the highlights of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">affordable housing bill</url> she released in the Senate months earlier \u2014 3.2 million new homes over 10 years, an increase in supply that Moody\u2019s estimated would reduce projected rents by 10 percent. When the tour ended, Simmons told the assembled reporters that he didn\u2019t know whom he would support for president, but Warren got points for showing up and being easy to talk to \u2014 \u201ctouchable,\u201d he said.</p><p>That night, Warren did a CNN town hall at Jackson State University, the third historically black college she has visited this year. Warren moved toward the audience at the first opportunity, walking past the chair placed for her onstage. She laid out the basics of her housing bill, stressing that it addressed the effects of discrimination. \u201cNot just a passive discrimination,\u201d Warren said. \u201cRealize that into the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families.\u201d Her bill included funds to help people from redlined areas, or who had been harmed by subprime loans, buy houses. The audience applauded.</p><p>Warren also said that night that she supported a \u201cnational full-blown conversation\u201d about reparations for slavery and Jim Crow. She saw this as a necessary response to the stark wealth gap between black and white families. \u201cToday in America \u2014 because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination \u2014 we live in a world where the average white family has $100 and the average black family has about $5.\u201d Several Democratic candidates have said they support a commission to study reparations. Ta-Nehisi Coates, author of the influential 2014 Atlantic article \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d said in a recent interview with The New Yorker that Warren was the candidate whose commitment seemed real because she had asked him to talk with her about his article when it came out years ago. \u201cShe was deeply serious,\u201d Coates said.</p><p>Warren is often serious and doesn\u2019t hesitate to convey her moral outrage. \u201cI\u2019ll own it,\u201d she told me about her anger. She talked about women expressing to her their distress about sexual harassment and assault. \u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Warren said. \u201cNo kidding that a woman might be angry about that. Women have a right to be angry about being treated badly.\u201d</p><p>Trump gets angry all the time; whether a woman can do the same and win remains a question. Warren\u2019s campaign is simultaneously working in another register. On Twitter, it has been posting videos of Warren calling donors who have given as little as $3. They can\u2019t believe it\u2019s her. When the comedian and actress Ashley Nicole Black <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">tweeted</url>, \u201cDo you think Elizabeth Warren has a plan to fix my love life?\u201d Warren tweeted back and then called Black, who finished the exchange with a fan-girl note: \u201cGuess who\u2019s crying and shaking and just talked to Elizabeth Warren on the phone?!?!? We have a plan to get my mom grandkids, it\u2019s very comprehensive, and it does involve raising taxes on billionaires.\u201d</p><p>After Trump\u2019s election, Warren and Sanders said that if Trump followed through on his promise to rebuild the economy for workers and their families, they would help. If Trump had championed labor over corporations, he could have scrambled American politics by creating new alliances. But that version of his presidency didn\u2019t come to pass. Instead, by waging trade wars that hurt farm states and manufacturing regions more than the rest of the country, Trump has punished his base economically (even if they take satisfaction in his irreverence and his judicial appointments).</p><p>Warren has been speaking to those voters. In June, she put out an \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d plan filled with ideas about helping American industries. By stepping into the vacuum for economic populism the president has left, Warren forced a reckoning on Fox News, Trump\u2019s safe space on TV, from the host Tucker Carlson. Usually a Trump loyalist, he has recently styled himself a voice for the white working class.</p><p>Carlson opened his show by using more than two minutes of airtime to quote Warren\u2019s analysis of how giant American companies are abandoning American workers. Carlson has warned that immigrants make the country \u201cpoorer and dirtier\u201d and laced his show with racism, but now he told his mostly Republican viewers: \u201cAsk yourself, what part of the statement you just heard did you disagree with?\u201d He continued, \u201cHere\u2019s the depressing part: Nobody you voted for said that or would ever say it.\u201d The next day, a new conservative Never Trump website called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">The Bulwark ran a long and respectful essay</url> called \u201cWhy Elizabeth Warren Matters.\u201d</p><p>A month earlier in Mingo County, W.Va., where more than 80 percent of voters cast a ballot for Trump, Warren went to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">local fire station</url> to talk about her plan for addressing the opioid crisis. It\u2019s big: She wants to spend $100 billion over 10 years, including $50 million annually for West Virginia, the state with the highest rate of deaths from drug overdoses. In Trump\u2019s latest budget, he has requested an increase of $1.5 billion to respond directly to the epidemic. Against a backdrop of firefighters\u2019 coats hanging in cinder-block cubbies, Warren moved among a crowd of about 150. Many hands went up when she asked who knew someone struggling with opioids. She brought up the role of \u201ccorporations that made big money off getting people addicted and keeping them addicted.\u201d People with \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d stickers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">nodded and clapped</url>, according to Politico.</p><p>If Warren competes for rural voters in the general election (if not to win a red state then to peel off enough of them to make a difference in a purple one), her strong support for abortion rights and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">gun control</url> will stand in her way. Lately, she has framed her argument for keeping abortion clinics open in economic terms, too. \u201cWomen of means will still have access to abortions,\u201d she said at a town hall on MSNBC hosted by Chris Hayes of the effects of new state laws aimed at closing clinics. \u201cWho won\u2019t will be poor women, will be working women, will be women who can\u2019t afford to take off three days from work, will be very young women.\u201d She finished by saying, \u201cWe do not pass laws that take away that freedom from the women who are most vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Biden and Sanders have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">been polling better</url> with non-college-educated white voters than Warren has. David Axelrod, the former Obama strategist and political commentator, thinks that even if her ideas resonate, she has yet to master the challenge of communicating with this group. \u201cShe\u2019s lecturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of resistance, because people feel like she\u2019s talking down to them.\u201d</p><p>Warren didn\u2019t sound to me like a law professor on the trail, but she did sound like a teacher. Trying to educate people isn\u2019t the easiest way to connect with them. \u201cMaybe she could bring it down a level,\u201d Lola Sewell, a community organizer in Selma, Ala., suggested. \u201cA lot of us aren\u2019t involved with Wall Street and those places.\u201d</p><p>Warren may also confront a double bind for professional women: To command respect, they have to prove that they\u2019re experts, but once they do, they\u2019re often seen as less likable. At one point, I asked Warren whether there was anything good about running for president as a woman. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d she said.</p><p>When I first talked with Warren in February, when her poll numbers were low, I wondered whether she was content with simply forcing Democratic candidates to engage with her ideas. During the 2016 primaries, when Warren did not endorse Sanders, she wanted influence over Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic appointments should she win the presidency. Cleaving the Democratic administration from Wall Street \u2014 that was enough at the time. She could make a similar decision in 2020 or try to get her own appointment. If Warren became Treasury secretary, she could resuscitate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Trump has worked to declaw, and tip all kinds of decisions away from banks and toward the families who come to her town halls and tell her about the loans they can\u2019t pay.</p><p>By mid-June, however, when I went to Washington to talk to Warren for the last time, she was very much in the race. New polls showed her in second place in California and Nevada. She had more to lose, and perhaps as a result, her answers were more scripted, more like her speeches.</p><p>Warren, like everyone in the race, has yet to prove that she has the political skills and broad-enough support to become president. But a parallel from another country suggests that perhaps bearing down on policy is the best strategy against right-wing populism. Luigi Zingales, the University of Chicago economist, comes from Italy, and he feared Trump\u2019s rise back in 2011, having watched the ascension of Silvio Berlusconi, the corrupt billionaire tycoon who was elected prime minister of Italy in the 2000s as a right-wing populist. After Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, Zingales pointed out <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html\">in a New York Times Op-Ed</url> that the two candidates who defeated Berlusconi treated him as \u201can ordinary opponent,\u201d focusing on policy issues rather than his character. \u201cThe Democratic Party should learn this lesson,\u201d Zingales wrote. He now thinks that Warren is positioned to mount that kind of challenge. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said, \u201cif she does not fall for his provocations.\u201d</p><p>Warren and I met in her Washington apartment. The floor at the entrance had been damaged by a leak in the building, and the vacuum cleaner was standing next to the kitchen counter. I said I was a bit relieved by the slight disarray because her house in Cambridge was so supremely uncluttered, and she burst out laughing. She sat on the couch as we spoke about the indignities to come, the way in which her opponents \u2014 Biden, Trump, who knew who else \u2014 would try to make her unrecognizable to herself. What would she do about that? Warren leaned back and stretched her feet out, comfortable in gray wool socks. \u201cThe answer is, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep talking to people \u2014 I like talking to people.\u201d</p><p>Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the author of \u201cCharged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration.\u201d </p><p>PHOTOS: Warren at a rally in May at Laney College in Oakland, Calif.

Capital One stored customer data on Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's popular cloud service. The senators wrote that Amazon does not implement the same level of security against the type of attack the suspected hacker used to obtain the data compared to companies like Google and Microsoft. Wyden previously wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos[2] in August requesting more information about Amazon's relationship to the attack. </p><p>It's unclear, however, if Amazon holds any blame since the attack was executed by exploiting a firewall misconfiguration \u2014 not because of a direct breach of Amazon's cloud service. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] United States senators Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachussetts) are urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Amazon[4] over the massive Capital One data breach that impacted more than 100 million people. In July, it was discovered that a hacker obtained sensitive Capital One customer data[5] that was stored on Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's popular cloud service. The incident impacted approximately 100 million people in the United States and six million in Canada, Capital One said at the time. The suspected hacker, former Amazon employee Paige A. Thompson, allegedly accessed the information by taking advantage of a firewall misconfiguration in Capital One's cloud infrastructure. Now, Wyden and Warren are pressing the FTC to investigate Amazon over whether or not what the senators called a \"failure to secure the servers it rented to Capital One\" would be in violation of federal law. In a letter[6] addressed to Joseph J. Simons, chairman of the FTC, Wyden and Warren accuse Amazon of not implementing the same level of protection against the type of attack that the suspected hacker used to obtain the data \u2014 known as a server side request forgery (SSRF) attack \u2014 as other tech firms like Microsoft and Google. The senators also write that Amazon knew that its servers were vulnerable to SSRF attacks since August 2018, when a cybersecurity researcher contacted the company. \"Amazon knew, or should have known, that AWS was vulnerable to SSRF attacks,\" the letter reads. \"Although Amazon's competitors addressed the threat of SSRF attacks several years ago, Amazon continues to sell defective cloud computing services to businesses, government agencies, and to the general public. As such, Amazon shares some responsibility for the theft of data on 100 million Capital One customers.\" An Amazon Web Services spokesperson called the letter's claims \"baseless\" in a statement to Business Insider, saying that the attacker targeted a misconfiguration of Capital One's firewall. See below for the company's full comment.\"The letter's claim is baseless and a publicity attempt from opportunistic politicians. As Capital One has explained, the perpetrator attacked a misconfiguration at the application layer of a Capital One firewall. The SSRF technique used in this incident was just one of many subsequent steps the perpetrator followed after gaining access to the company's systems, and could have been substituted for a number of other methods given the level of access already gained.\"The FTC did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Ameesh Divatia, CEO and co-founder of data protection firm Baffle, also said that the blame should not rest with Amazon. \"Step one in terms of mitigating these issues is [to] get out of this false sense of security that cloud users have, that Amazon will take care of it,\" Divatia said to Business Insider[7] back in July. Wyden previously wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos seeking more information about the company's potential role in the incident. This new letter comes as tech firms like Amazon have come under increased scrutiny over concerns relating to consumer privacy and potentially anticompetitive business practices. The FTC is said to have begun an investigation to determine whether Amazon is using its size and reach to hamper competition in September, according to Bloomberg.[8] Warren and Wyden have also been vocal critics of tech industry giants like Amazon. Back in March, Warren proposed a plan[9] to break up large tech firms like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, while Wyden recently introduced a bill[10] cracking down on tech firms and executives that violate user privacy.NOW WATCH: 8 prostheses that are changing lives[11]See Also: Toy brands are reportedly paying Amazon millions of dollars for the chance to be featured in its annual holiday

US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has made regulating big tech a cornerstone of her campaign, tweeted[2] that lawmakers would continue to hold Page accountable for the company's business practices because of his majority control of the voting power, regardless of his title. Warren also said she still expected Pageto testify about the company before Congress. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren isn't letting former Alphabet CEO Larry Page off the hook. Page, along with Alphabet President Sergey Brin, said that they would step down from their executive positions at Google's parent company, announcing the change through a blog post[4] on Tuesday. The Google cofounders' announcement signaled the end of a 21-year era during which they have presided over the company. But changes in Alphabet's corporate structure also come at a time when its flagship company Google has faced close regulatory scrutiny over its business practices and the way it treats consumer data. So far, Page has largely stayed out of the spotlight. Instead, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has served as the face of the company, leading its press events, town halls, and appearing in Congressional hearings. Warren, who has made regulating big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook a cornerstone[5] of her campaign for president, drew attention to Page's absence from regulatory hearings in a tweet. \"Congrats on the move, Larry Page!\" she tweeted[6]. \"Quick reminder: We do still expect you to testify before Congress.\" She also highlighted the fact that Page and Brin still remain firmly in control over the company[7], through their joint share holdings. \"Changing your title while staying on the board and retaining effective control of it will not exempt you from accountability.\" The Democrat senator from Massachusetts has been deeply critical[8] of Google's dominance in the tech industry and its business practices, and has campaigned[9] for the company to be broken up. \"I want a government that makes sure everybody \u2014 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2014 plays by the rules,\" Warren said in a statementto The New York Times[10] in March. \"To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\" NOW WATCH: Most maps of Louisiana aren't entirely right. Here's what the state really looks like.[11]See Also: Read the email Sundar Pichai sent Google employees after founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced they were stepping down[12]These are the 5 big changes Sundar Pichai could make to kick off his reign as Alphabet CEO[13]Larry Page and Sergey Brin brought in a new age of founder control over companies in Silicon Valley.

Under her proposal, regulators would be appointed to undo some tech mergers. Her plan also calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace. Her plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by tech giants, including Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Waze. How she uses it The policy further cements Ms. Warren as one of the Democratic candidates most willing to call for large-scale changes in the name of equality. Ms. Warren has taken her fight directly to Silicon Valley. A billboard installed in San Francisco, paid for by her campaign, reads: \"Break Up Big Tech.\" Obstacles The tech companies Ms. Warren has called out grew the way they did because, well, they wanted to. Officials at top tech companies have previously signaled that they believe they can police themselves, and they are highly unlikely to accept any sort of government regulation without a costly and bruising fight. It is also unclear how popular Ms. Warren's antitrust proposal is with voters, many of whom have come to enjoy and rely on the services offered by big tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRFWK-99902f7456d91d4812652864cac6842b5c522cd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRFWK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFM-2521-JBCN-446G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387629</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren is coming for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts senator, who is running for president in what has already become a crowded and chaotic Democratic primary, said Friday that if she is elected president, she intends to break up the biggest technology companies \u201cto restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power\u200a\u2014\u200atoo much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post outlining her proposal. \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. \u2026 I want a government that makes sure everybody\u200a\u2014\u200aeven the biggest and most powerful companies in America\u200a\u2014\u200aplays by the rules. And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish.\u201d</p><p>Warren intends to appoint federal regulators who would reverse some major recent mergers and acquisitions in the tech sector, including Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods and Zappos and Google\u2019s acquisition of Waze and DoubleClick.</p><p>Her plan also includes a new designation for some large tech platforms\u2019 marketplaces and exchanges, like Amazon Marketplace and Google\u2019s ad exchange. Under Warren\u2019s rules, those companies would be labeled \u201cplatform utilities\u201d and would be prohibited from owning other companies that participate on the platform and from sharing or transferring data with third parties. Under the plan, Amazon Marketplace and Google\u2019s ad exchange would be required to be split and spun off from the companies.</p><p>Warren compared Amazon, Facebook and Google to companies like Standard Oil and JPMorgan, which legislators broke up using antitrust laws, and to Microsoft, which was sued over anti-monopoly laws and eventually broken up. Taking the same approach to existing tech giants, Warren wrote, would help encourage continued competition in the market and allow disruptive startups and small businesses to join the fray without fear of being snuffed out.</p><p>\u201cWe must ensure that today\u2019s tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\u201d Warren wrote.</p><p>Warren also advocated for data privacy rules that \u201cgive people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared and sold\u201d and encouraged the support of content creators to \u201ckeep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook.\u201d</p><p>Warren did not elaborate on whether she had specific policy plans to address these issues. A Warren campaign spokesperson did not immediately return requests for additional information about those plans.</p><p>Representatives for Amazon, Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Warren has long advocated for regulatory measures to address the power of big corporations; she made a national name for herself in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis by advocating for tough regulations on Wall Street and breaking up big banks.</p><p>Other legislators have indicated an appetite to break up big tech, including Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat who heads up the House Antitrust Subcommittee, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut.</p><p>In the European Union, Google has repeatedly faced record fines for anti-competitive business practices, and Facebook has been embroiled in an ongoing lawsuit alleging anti-competitive business practices. On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg detailed plans to combine the messaging services of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, a move some legislators slammed as anti-competitive.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is considering hitting Facebook with a record fine over privacy violations. It\u2019s unclear whether that legal fight would press for a breakup.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1029060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-0CN1-JC8H-T1KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

She compared Amazon to the dystopian novel \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d in which those with power force their wishes on the less fortunate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of freeloading billionaires,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ms. Warren\u2019s policy announcement sent reverberations from New York to Silicon Valley, as she further cemented herself as one of the Democratic candidates most willing to call for large-scale changes to the country\u2019s structure in the name of equality.</p><p>Among the crowded field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, Ms. Warren has done the most to add detail to those early proposals, including a plan for universal child care, a tax on the country\u2019s wealthiest families, and, as of Friday, breaking up big technological giants.</p><p>Ms. Warren\u2019s regulatory plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by tech giants, the campaign said, including Facebook\u2019s deals for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">WhatsApp</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">Instagram</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">Amazon\u2019s addition of Whole Foods</url>, and Google\u2019s purchase of Waze. Companies would be barred from transferring or sharing users\u2019 data with third parties.

Ms. Warren is also sending a political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among candidates.</p><p>In the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Ms. Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon \u2014 though Mr. Sanders and Ms. Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Senator Kamala Harris, who represents many of those companies based in her home state of California, has repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">pressed executives on consumer privacy</url> but has stayed away from direct calls to limit their influence. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">more willing to embrace the controversial corporations</url>, who have frequently used their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties.</p><p>\u201cOur technology industry is the envy of the world and we need policies that will foster innovation and consumer choice \u2014 but we also need stronger enforcement of antitrust law,\u201d said Ro Khanna, the California House Democrat who represents Silicon Valley headquarters of companies such as Apple and eBay. He said that blanket statements against big tech companies weren\u2019t helpful, but that each company needed to be \u201cevaluated on a case-by-case basis and afforded due process.\u201d</p><p>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.</url>]</p><p>Ms. Warren\u2019s plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90 million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to \u201cstructurally separate\u201d their products from their marketplace. Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace.</p><p>Ms. Warren, who has previously said moving to Boston would have been a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d for Amazon, said in a Medium post Friday morning that companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act \u2014 in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">words</url> of Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 \u201cmore like a government than a traditional company.\u201d</p><p>During a brief interview later in New York, Ms. Warren refused to say whether Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was right to have offered <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html\">hefty tax incentives</url> to Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens. Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, from Ms. Warren\u2019s home state, also offered similar incentives.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore you even get into the question of do you need to change the statutes, there are structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon from dancing its way across America saying, \u2018What will you offer me if I came?\u2019\u201d</p><p>This is a refrain she has hit for years, including in a 2016 speech titled \u201cReigniting Competition in the American Economy.\u201d Last year, she introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act, which seeks to curb shareholder power by forcing corporations to increase worker representation on their governing boards, while also reducing incentives for big companies to pay out shareholders rather than reinvest in businesses.</p><p>Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute in Washington and a former senior adviser to the Senate Budget Committee, said Ms. Warren\u2019s plan was \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d He compared big tech companies to the tobacco monopolies of America\u2019s past, which were eventually subjected to antitrust lawsuits.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a traditional sense around the politics of D.C. that these companies are progressive,\u201d Mr. Stoller said. \u201cTheir employees give to Democrats, they\u2019re friendly to social liberalism, there\u2019s an idealism to how they talk about the world. That\u2019s been the traditional sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these companies have the moral frame of Big Tobacco,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Carl Szabo, who is vice president at an e-commerce trade association called NetChoice, said he felt Ms. Warren\u2019s plan was unnecessary. He warned that it could lead to weaponization of antitrust laws, as legislators target companies deemed to be their enemies.</p><p>\u201cPoliticizing and weaponizing antitrust law is ripe for abuse,\u201d said Mr. Szabo, who is a professor of privacy law at George Mason University\u2019s law school. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how politics can inject itself into antitrust reviews, and I don\u2019t think our legislators should be encouraging this precedent.\u201d</p><p>Though tech giants have experienced several controversies in recent years, it is unclear how popular Ms. Warren\u2019s antitrust proposal would be with voters. Rob Atkinson, president of Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry-sponsored group, defended the power of big companies in the technology sector for what he described as benefits to consumers.</p><p>\u201cThe Warren campaign\u2019s call to break up big tech companies reflects a \u2018big is bad, small is beautiful\u2019 ideology run amok,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. \u201cThe proposal ignores the fact that many of the services big tech companies now provide free used to cost consumers money.\u201d</p><p>Matt McIlwain, a partner at the Seattle venture capital firm Madrona Venture Group, which was an early Amazon investor, said in an email, \u201cSenator Warren and others with a similar mind-set are misguided on the need to break up larger tech companies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompanies in the innovation economy have a strong track record of creating quality products and services that are often free or at dramatically lower costs than previous services,\u201d Mr. McIlwain said.</p><p>For those closely watching the Democratic presidential nomination contest, the announcement was another example of Ms. Warren\u2019s political strategy, which is to appeal to voters based on policy ideas and retail politics, not soaring oration or feel-good messages of unity.</p><p>Among the crowd in Queens, which included more young people than many Warren rallies across the country, several said they appreciated her policy focus.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that she focuses on concrete policy, this early in the race, is really aspirational,\u201d said Milo Vassallo, who is involved in several Brooklyn leftist groups.

Warren's multi-pronged proposal would establish stricter oversight of mergers and require that companies that run marketplaces, such as Amazon  , not also sell their own products on those marketplaces. Amazon's stock was down 1.3% on Friday afternoon on an overall weak day for the market that saw the Nasdaq falling 0.7% and the S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.8%. </p><p>Warren called out a few major mergers that her plan would have the authority to unwind, writing that doing so \"will promote healthy competition in the market -- which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy.\" Those include:</p><p><br/><br/>Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos <br/>Facebook's  acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram<br/>Alphabet's  acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick <br/><br/></p><p>Facebook shares fell 0.7%, while Alphabet was trading down 0.9% on Friday.</p><p>As debates about privacy and competition come to the fore, Democratic lawmakers and attorneys general -- and  -- have  in stricter antitrust oversight of Big Tech. Other Democratic presidential hopefuls, such as Senators Amy Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders, have also been critical of large tech companies. Whether Warren's plan is feasible, or how it would be applied, is another question. </p><p>Andrea Murino, a partner at Goodwin and co-chair of the firm's antitrust practice, pointed out that while the government can unwind mergers, convincing a court that doing so is the right approach would be a very heavy lift. </p><p>\"The government has the authority to unwind transactions, but to do so requires meeting a substantial evidentiary burden,\" Murino said. \"[Arguing that] by unscrambling the eggs, you're going to end up restoring lost competition is incredibly challenging to do.\" </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

As an example, she wrote, <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/music/news/spotify-google-and-pandora-go-to-u-s-appeals-court-to-overturn-royalty-increase-exclusive-1203157697/\">Google</url>'s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart, and Google search would have to be spun off. Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more that offer an online marketplace or a third-party exchange, like Amazon Marketplace and Google's ad exchange, would be designated as utilities.</p><p>The companies would also be prohibited from discrimination in dealing with users, applying some of the name net neutrality standards that have been aimed at internet providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T. The platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties, a provision designed to address growing concerns about the privacy of personal information provided by consumers.</p><p>Smaller companies, or those with global revenue between $90 million and $25 billion, would also be prohibited from discriminatory conduct, the would not be required to make the same divestitures as the larger platforms.</p><p>Warren also said she would appoint regulators to undo existing mergers, and she specifically cited Amazon's ownership of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook from WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google from Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.</p><p>She wrote that the proposals will give small businesses a \"fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn't smother competitors from demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy.\"</p><p>Federal regulators, state attorneys general or private parties would get the right to sue a platform utility for violating the regulations, with the ability to collect \"ill-gotten gains,\" losses and damages. A company also would be fined 5% of annual revenue if found in violation.</p><p>Her proposals go farther than other Democratic presidential candidates in prescribing solutions to the marketplace dominance and political power of major platforms.</p><p>While other candidates aren't proposing as sweeping of measures to rein in the power of big business, there has been a shift in how they are talking about big tech. In recent presidential cycles presidential contenders treated Silicon Valley tech giants as shining examples of the economy. Now they are targets, as politicians express concerns over privacy, data collection and antitrust.</p><p>Sen. <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/amy-klobuchar/\">Amy Klobuchar</url> (D-Minn.), one of Warren's rivals for the nomination who is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said this week that it is her goal to \"make antitrust cool again.\" She has unveiled a set of proposals that includes shifting the burden to companies to prove that their mega mergers do not harm competition.</p><p>Warren put her proposal in the context of the trust-busting that followed the Gilded Age, when Standard Oil, JPMorgan and AT&amp;T controlled vast sectors of the economy. She noted that reformers in both parties sought to break up the conglomerates.</p><p>Some of her ideas actually have some buy in on the right. When he was still in the White House, Steve Bannon<url normalizedValue=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/27/steve-bannon-wants-facebook-and-google-regulated-like-utilities/\">floated the idea</url> of regulating Google and Facebook as utilities. President Trump has at times railed against big tech and suggested that they have antitrust problems, although he also believes that the platforms have been unfair to conservatives and conservative content.</p><p>At a Senate hearing this week called \"Does America Have a Monopoly Problem?,\" she was joined by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in expressing \"great concern\" over the increasing concentration across the economy, not just in tech.</p><p>He said his concern was the \"drowning out of small and individual voices\" and also \"the ability of these behemoth corporations to extract favors from government and to leverage their economic power into political power. That results in cronyism and insider dealing, and in the manipulation of our free market into something that is decidedly not free and that is rigged.\"</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, urged \"some humility in how we approach this work, about our understanding, about how our markets function, particularly before we condemn activity that appears to benefit consumers.\"</p><p>NetChoice, an eCommerce trade group, said Warren's proposals were misguided. Carl Szabo, its VP and general counsel, said in a statement that it would \"increase prices for consumers, make search and maps less useful, and raise costs to small businesses that advertise online.\" He argued that \"never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services, and opportunities online.\"</p><p>Democrats have long enjoyed lopsided support from the tech industry. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, almost 80% of contributions from employees of internet companies went to federal Democratic candidates and committees in 2018.</p><p>Warren, however, is not taking PAC money, and she recently announced that she would not attend high-dollar fundraisers with major donors.</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/hollywood-democrat-2020-election-trump-1203155795/\">As Democrats Lurch Further Left, Will Hollywood Follow?</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/music/news/spotify-google-and-pandora-go-to-u-s-appeals-court-to-overturn-royalty-increase-exclusive-1203157697/\">Spotify, Google, Pandora, Amazon Go to U.S. Appeals Court to Overturn Royalty Increase (EXCLUSIVE)</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/gridiron-club-dinner-ivanka-trump-1203153914/\">Ivanka Trump, D.C.

Her proposal threatens to put a spotlight on those companies and their business practices, one that could expose them to reputational harm. Moreover, it represents an attempt to gain support for a rethinking of antitrust policy, one in which regulators scrutinize the effects of concentrated corporate power on things other than just consumer prices. Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet's power looks benign if only viewed from the lens of consumer prices. </p><p>Their power looks much worse if its broader effects are taken into account. It's been a long time since antitrust policy has been a major topic of a presidential election. Elizabeth Warren is trying change that \u2014 and it's bad news for Amazon, Facebook, and Google parent Alphabet. Warren declared Friday[5] that if she's elected president, one of her centerpiece policies will be to break up those three big-tech firms[6]. She wants to unwind their past mergers and split up other parts of their business to rein in their power and increase competition. Right now, Warren's still a long shot[7] to secure the Democratic Party nomination, much less win the 2020 election, so the tech firms aren't in immediate danger. But Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Page would be foolish to dismiss the threat she just unleashed. Warren is tapping into public angst about tech's influence on our lives and channeling it into a legal mechanism that, however rusted it's become over the years, has the capacity to subjugate even the most powerful businesses. With a two-year election cycle just getting started, the tech industry is now officially America's number one corporate villain \u2014 more dangerous than Wall Street bankers or Martin Shkreli \u2014 and the debate is now focused on real reforms centered on legitimate antitrust policy rather than mere populist rage. That's bad news for Big Tech. Even if she's not elected president, Warren's move has increased the chance that the rulers of the tech universe are going to draw damaging fire, no matter who is.Warren wants to shine a spotlight on the big tech companiesThe tech industry has really never faced this kind of scrutiny. Yes, certain companies in the industry have faced antitrust actions, including Microsoft in the famous trial at the turn of the last century. And some of those actions, including the Microsoft trial and the AT...reakup of the 1980s drew widespread public attention. But discussion over what to do about those companies' conduct was generally left up to the courts or federal agencies. It wasn't a big topic of debate in a presidential election. In 2000, for example, George W. Bush said little about the then-ongoing Microsoft trial, and it was an open question when he took office how his administration would approach the case. When his Justice Department agreed to a settlement that stopped short of breaking up the company, the decision came as something of a surprise. Warren's doesn't want antitrust policy to be ignored this time around. Instead, she wants antitrust policy to be in the spotlight, and she wants a public debate about how these big tech companies should be regulated. If she succeeds, it would be one of the first times that corporate concentration of power has been a major election issue since the Progressive Era of the early 1900s. Part of the danger for the tech companies is what the bright light that Warren wants to shine on them is going to reveal about them \u2014 and how the public is going to react to what they see.Neither Facebook nor Microsoft looked good in lightsFor Facebook, we already have a good sense of this. The social networking company spent much of the last two years with a Klieg light shining on it. The company's reputation wilted under the intense lights, which exposed its casual treatment of customers' private data, its questionable business practices, and the way its core product, the newsfeed, had been hijacked to spread dangerous propaganda. Amid these revelations, Facebook's user growth has stalled in the US and Europe, its revenue growth has slowed, and people are using it less. It's also facing a major fine from the Federal Trade Commission, and the exposures have bolstered calls by critics to impose new restrictions on its business. A similar thing happened with the Microsoft antitrust trial two decades ago. When the government first started scrutinizing the software giant, it was among the most respected and loved companies with the public at large. But the revelations from the trial about its ruthless business practices and particularly the sheer arrogance and disdain that then CEO Bill Gates displayed in his testimony in the case helped sour public perceptions of the company.Arguably, the reputational hit that Microsoft took from the trial created as much of an opening for its competitors as did the restrictions the government placed on its business as part of the settlement that ended the case. In the wake of the trial, consumers and businesses were much more willing to try rival services such as Google's search engine and, later, its suite of productivity tools. Meanwhile, other corporations were much more guarded about doing business with Microsoft, not wanting to put themselves in the same beholden position as the PC makers in the 90s, where the software giant dictated all the terms of the relationship. Amazon and Google could face similar trouble if Warren's able to focus the spotlight on them too.Warren's trying to fundamentally change antitrust policyBut Warren's call represents a bigger danger for Amazon, Facebook, and Google, because she's trying to fundamentally change the terms of the debate. Under the influence of conservative economists from the University of Chicago, the federal government in the early 1980s completely rethought how it scrutinized corporate power. Instead of viewing concentrations of corporate power in a dim light, federal regulators generally came to view them favorably. Rather than worrying about the effects of such power on competition in particular markets or other potential problems of corporate concentration, they started focusing on just one aspect: price. In general, they only worried about enforcing antitrust laws if a company used its market power to raise prices on consumers or was likely to do so. Read this: Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon have too much power \u2014 so it's time for regulators to take on tech's titans[8] But in recent years, a growing collection of academic experts on the left have pushing back against this focus on price. Such a limited lens ignores the broader harms caused by concentrated corporate power, they argue. Backed in many cases by extensive research, they contend that curtailed competition across a broad range of industries has kept wages low, discouraged the formation of new companies and new job growth, hindered innovation, and undermined democratic government[9]. To date, the debate over whether to take a broader view of antitrust policy has largely been confined to academic circles and policy wonks. Warren, whose proposals are built on the research and arguments of the left-wing advocates of renewed robust antitrust enforcement, is making a bid to take their view of competition policy mainstream by putting it front-and-center in the presidential election.Amazon, Facebook, and Google would prefer to stick with pricesThat's something Amazon, Facebook, and Google \u2014 not to mention other corporate giants that dominate their own markets \u2014 really don't want. If antitrust policy continues to focus just on price, Amazon, Facebook, and Google could easily argue that they don't pose a problem. Facebook and Google offer their services for free to consumers, and Amazon is renowned for the low prices it charges on its goods. But if regulators start scrutinizing the broader effects of their power, and how it's distorting their respective markets, they're much more likely to see the need to crack down on the big-tech companies.The European Union, which isn't fixated on consumer prices, has already found that Google illegally tried to thwart competition by rivals and has fined it billions of dollars[10]. Publishers have complained for years that Facebook and Google's dominance over the digital advertising business[11] has left little room for them to build sustainable businesses. Read this: Europe's competition czar is wrong \u2014 it's long past time to break up Google[12] And retailers and goods makers have accused Amazon of undermining their businesses. In part due to Amazon's power over ecommerce, they feel compelled to offer their goods on its site. But they charge that Amazon uses information it collects about their sales to identify their most popular products and offer competitors that undercut them on price. Google, Facebook, and Amazon would almost certainly rather not have to defend such practices to regulators or before a court. But thanks to Warren, they may soon have to. Warren may never be president, and she may never get a chance to put in place the policies she proposed Friday. But she's raised the chances that Amazon, Google, and Facebook are going to see a comeuppance whoever takes the White House.

Even if she's not elected president, Warren's move has increased the chance that the rulers of the tech universe are going to be met with damaging criticism, no matter who is doing the criticizing.</p><h>Warren wants to shine a spotlight on the big tech companies</h><p>The tech industry has really never faced this kind of scrutiny. Yes, certain companies in the industry have faced antitrust actions, including Microsoft in the infamous trial at the turn of the last century. And some of those actions, including the Microsoft trial and the AT&amp;T breakup of the 1980s, drew widespread public attention.</p><p>But discussion over what to do about those companies' conduct was generally left up to the courts or federal agencies. It wasn't a big topic of debate in a presidential election. In 2000, for example, President George W. Bush said little about the Microsoft trial, which was ongoing at the time, and it was an open question when he took office how his administration would approach the case. When his Justice Department agreed to a settlement that stopped short of breaking up the company, the decision came as something of a surprise.</p><p>Warren doesn't want antitrust policy to be ignored this time around. Instead, she wants antitrust policy to be in the spotlight, and she wants a public debate about how these big tech companies should be regulated. If she succeeds, it will be one of the first times that corporate concentration of power has been a major election issue since the Progressive Era of the early 1900s.</p><p>Part of the danger for the tech companies is what the bright light that Warren wants to shine on them is going to reveal about them - and how the public is going to react to what they see.</p><h>Neither Facebook nor Microsoft looked good in the spotlight</h><p>For Facebook, we already have a good sense of this. The social-networking company spent much of the last two years with a Klieg light shining on it. The company's reputation wilted under the intense lights, which exposed its casual treatment of customers' private data, its questionable business practices, and the way its core product - the newsfeed - had been hijacked to spread dangerous propaganda.</p><p>Amid these revelations, Facebook's user growth has stalled in the US and Europe, its revenue growth has slowed, and people are using it less. It's also facing a major fine from the Federal Trade Commission, and the exposure has bolstered calls by critics to impose new restrictions on its business.</p><p>A similar thing happened with the Microsoft antitrust trial two decades ago. When the government first started scrutinizing the software giant, it was among the most respected and loved companies of the public at large. But the revelations from the trial about its ruthless business practices, particularly the sheer arrogance and disdain that then-CEO Bill Gates displayed in his testimony in the case, helped sour the public perception of the company.</p><p>Reuters/Jeff Christensen</p><p>Arguably, the reputational hit that Microsoft took from the trial created an opening for its competitors in addition to the restrictions the government placed on its business as part of the settlement that ended the case. In the wake of the trial, consumers and businesses were much more willing to try rival services, such as Google's search engine and its suite of productivity tools, which came out later.</p><p>Meanwhile, other corporations were much more guarded about doing business with Microsoft, not wanting to put themselves in the same beholden position as the PC makers in the '90s, when the software giant dictated all the terms of the relationship.</p><p>Amazon and Google could face similar trouble if Warren's able to focus the spotlight on them, too.</p><h>Warren is trying to fundamentally change antitrust policy</h><p>But Warren's call represents a bigger danger for Amazon, Facebook, and Google because she's trying to fundamentally change the terms of the debate. Under the influence of conservative economists from the University of Chicago, the federal government in the early '80s completely rethought how it scrutinized corporate power.</p><p>Instead of viewing concentrations of corporate power in a dim light, federal regulators generally came to view them favorably. Rather than worrying about the effects of such power on competition in particular markets or other problems related to corporate concentration, they started focusing on just one aspect: price. In general, they worried only about enforcing antitrust laws if a company used its market power to raise prices on consumers or was likely to do so.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more: Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon have too much power - so it's time for regulators to take on tech's titans</emphasis></p><p>But in recent years, a growing collection of academic experts on the left have pushed back against this focus on price. Such a limited lens ignores the broader harms caused by concentrated corporate power, they say. Backed in many cases by extensive research, they contend that curtailed competition across a broad range of industries has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16021844/antitrust-better-deal\">kept wages low, discouraged the formation of new companies and job growth, hindered innovation, and undermined democratic government</url>.</p><p>To date, the debate over whether to take a broader view of antitrust policy has largely been confined to academic circles and policy wonks. Warren, whose proposals are built on the research and arguments of the left-wing advocates of renewed, robust antitrust enforcement, is making a bid to take their view of competition policy mainstream by putting it front-and-center in the presidential election.</p><h>Amazon, Facebook, and Google would prefer to stick with prices</h><p>That's something Amazon, Facebook, and Google - not to mention other corporate giants that dominate their own markets - really don't want.</p><p>If antitrust policy continues to focus just on price, Amazon, Facebook, and Google could easily argue that they don't pose a problem. Facebook and Google offer their services for free to consumers, and Amazon is renowned for the low prices it charges on its goods.</p><p>But if regulators start scrutinizing the broader effects of their power and how it's distorting their respective markets, they're much more likely to see the need to crack down on the big tech companies.</p><p>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p><p>The European Union, which isn't fixated on consumer prices, has already found that Google illegally tried to thwart competition by rivals and has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-fined-by-eu-android-2018-7?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">fined it billions of dollars</url>. Publishers have complained for years that Facebook and Google's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-and-facebook-dominate-the-world-of-online-advertising-charts-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">dominance over the digital-advertising business</url> has left little room for them to build sustainable businesses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more: Europe's competition czar is wrong - it's long past time to break up Google</emphasis></p><p>And retailers and goods makers have accused Amazon of undermining their businesses. In part because of Amazon's power over e-commerce, they feel compelled to offer their goods on its site.

Now presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, says she wants to break up the major tech firms.Warren has joined a chorus of political leaders on both sides of politics voicing their concerns about the impact of Big Tech on America's well being. </p><p>She published an opinion piece on Medium on March 8 proclaiming that big tech companies have 'too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.' She later added 'we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor.'In Digiday's coverage[1] of the SXSW tech conference, they cited Warren's proposed solution. This included such initiatives as 'eliminating the ability for a platform to control a marketplace.' It also mentioned her plan to 'split up companies like Amazon, which also sells its own, competing private-label brands on its own site.'In her Medium[2] piece she cited the problems of big tech and the numerous ways she proposed to address them. 'Today's big tech companies have too much power   too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.'She explained her intention to have a government that insures fairness. One that would enable the rise of new tech companies and healthy competition. 'To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.'Warren also explained that platforms with their own marketplaces use their power to protect their own shares of the market. \"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version. Google allegedly snuffed out a competing small search engine by demoting its content on its search algorithm, and it has favored its own restaurant ratings over those of Yelp,' she continued.Warren blamed the problems of the big tech monopolies on 'mergers' used to to \"limit competition.\" She gave example such as Facebook's acquisitions of other social media platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp.The liberal presidential candidate called out Apple during the South by Southwest conference she called out Apple specifically. \"Apple, you've got to break it apart from their App Store. It's got to be one or the other,' she explained. Warren elaborated further on how offering one's own product on a platform can suppress competition: \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\"She made a case for her reforms by citing historical precedent saying that this breed of antitrust legislation \"applied to railroad companies more than a hundred years ago,\" and therefore \"we need to now look at those tech platforms the same way.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/technology-brings-truth-sxsw-debates-tech-regulation/\">https://digiday.com/marketing/technology-brings-truth-sxsw-debates-tech-regulation/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-NBST1077781552334771355251766100047</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-9KB1-JB4V-80R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><timeReceived>8:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, says she wants to break up the major tech firms.Warren has joined a chorus of political leaders on both sides of politics voicing their concerns about the impact of Big Tech on America's well being. </p><p>She published an opinion piece on Medium on March 8 proclaiming that big tech companies have 'too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.' She later added 'we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor.'In Digiday's coverage[1] of the SXSW tech conference, they cited Warren's proposed solution. This included such initiatives as 'eliminating the ability for a platform to control a marketplace.' It also mentioned her plan to 'split up companies like Amazon, which also sells its own, competing private-label brands on its own site.'In her Medium[2] piece she cited the problems of big tech and the numerous ways she proposed to address them. 'Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.'She explained her intention to have a government that insures fairness. One that would enable the rise of new tech companies and healthy competition. 'To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.'Warren also explained that platforms with their own marketplaces use their power to protect their own shares of the market. \"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version. Google allegedly snuffed out a competing small search engine by demoting its content on its search algorithm, and it has favored its own restaurant ratings over those of Yelp,' she continued.Warren blamed the problems of the big tech monopolies on 'mergers' used to to \"limit competition.\" She gave example such as Facebook's acquisitions of other social media platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp.The liberal presidential candidate called out Apple during the South by Southwest conference she called out Apple specifically. \"Apple, you've got to break it apart from their App Store. It's got to be one or the other,' she explained. Warren elaborated further on how offering one's own product on a platform can suppress competition: \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\"She made a case for her reforms by citing historical precedent saying that this breed of antitrust legislation \"applied to railroad companies more than a hundred years ago,\" and therefore \"we need to now look at those tech platforms the same way.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/technology-brings-truth-sxsw-debates-tech-regulation/\">https://digiday.com/marketing/technology-brings-truth-sxsw-debates-tech-regulation/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NBST1077781552334771355251766100047</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-92Y1-JCMN-Y47N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><timeReceived>8:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Breaking them up, she added, would \"restore the balance of power in our democracy, promote competition, and ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last.\"</p><p>Warren's proposal has two main elements. One is ensuring that regulators are committed to blocking or reversing \"illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" she wrote, citing Amazon buying Whole Foods, Facebook's acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google controlling Waze, Nest and DoubleClick. The second is legislation requiring the tech giants to spin off holdings like Amazon's marketplace and Google search from the same companies' business on those platforms.</p><p>The 2020 presidential candidate published the Medium post as she was traveling to New York's Long Island City neighborhood, the area where Amazon had planned to build a new headquarters until abruptly pulling out last month. Warren, who spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Consumer Protection Agency under President Obama, sided with Amazon opponents such as first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who led protests against the billions in tax breaks promised to the company in exchange for creating 25,000 jobs. Warren has labeled the incentives \"taxpayer bribes.\"</p><p>Warren's big-tech breakup plan is one of the strongest initiatives introduced by any 2020 candidate. Technology and tech policy is sure to be a significant issue in the campaign. The first half of the Donald Trump presidency has seen the president spar with Amazon and charge Google and Facebook with anti-conservative bias. Last year Facebook founder-CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his top deputy, Sheryl Sandburg, each testified on Capitol Hill about the company's handling of user data and lack of privacy controls.</p><p>The privacy issue took another turn for Facebook earlier this week, when Zuckerberg announced the company would introduce features like \"disappearing\" messages across all three of the company's social platforms: Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Zuckerberg, who famously declared in 2010 that privacy was \"no longer a societal norm,\" said the new approach would enhance customer privacy, but many politicians, tech industry observers and activists disagreed.</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/03/port-of-earth-amazon-skybound-developing-top-cows-gritty-sci-fi-epic-1202572323/\">'Port Of Earth': Amazon &amp;

She gets name-checked because, yes, she's been very vocal about it. But while a President Warren could ask her Department of Justice or Congressional committees to investigate Facebook, she couldn't do it by herself.</p><p> What's more pressing for Zuckerberg and his peers is that big tech companies are already facing a growing number of investigations from various government entities.</p><p> Since the recorded Facebook meetings took place in July, a group of seven state attorneys general launched an investigation into Facebook and Google and nearly every state in the country joined forces for a separate investigation into Google. Then there's the probe being led by the House Judiciary Committee which has asked companies including Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple for a trove of internal documents.</p><p> In fact, there are so many Big Tech investigations in play right now, the New York Times created a tracker just to help keep tabs on all of them.</p><p> Zuckerberg should probably be more worried about his competition rather than what the candidates are saying. Snapchat was apparently all too happy to spill some tea to federal investigators about allegedly anti-competitive practices from Facebook, and odds are there are plenty of other companies ready to do the same.</p><p> Warren has become a symbolic villain for Zuckerberg. But there is a much larger group of enemies pounding at Facebook's gates right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>New battle lines have been drawn between Facebook and Elizabeth Warren as the 2020 race heats up Image: Mashable Composite: Alex Wong / Getty Photos,  Scott Olson / Getty Photos</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-466259a57a189f826ab9d7b13a97395ab7bcc7c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C251672A101 MSHNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-P7K1-DXVP-V1BP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

He says:<br/>\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u00a0Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That's not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things.\u00a0But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"<br/>Hours after\u00a0The Verge shared these audio files, Warren shared a long thread of tweets, where she\u00a0once against\u00a0criticised Facebook for having grown so big.<br/>She said that\u00a0Zuckerberg has himself said that Facebook is \"more like a government than a traditional company.\" Warren says that using \"our private information for profit\", Facebook has tilted the playing field against everyone else.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Responding to Zuckerberg's statement in the audio clips, she said, \"What would really 'suck,' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>She says that she plans to break up\u00a0companies like Facebook to \"undo their illegal, anticompetitive mergers.\" She also pointed out that breaking up these companies does not mean that you will not be able to access platforms like Facebook and Instagram, but that \"they'll have to compete with each other to make a better product for you.\"<br/>Soon after Warren's tweet thread, Zuckerberg also responded to the episode in a Facebook post, where he also embedded the entire audio file for people to listen.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In her proposal, Warren advances\u00a0two ways to take forward the breaking up process:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Companies with an annual global turnover of $25 billion or more will be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and will be prevented from being a participating seller on these platforms. Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Warren's administration would appoint regulators to ensure that illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers are reversed.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>The idea behind this move, according to Warren, is that small businesses should not be gobbled up by Big Tech. For instance, if there is a small business selling its wares on Amazon and doing great business, there is a high chance that Amazon will either try to buy this seller or have a similar product on its marketplace, which Amazon could promote over the small business.

Elizabeth Warren[1] is going after Mark Zuckerberg[2] and his company, Facebook[3]. Warren argues that Facebook is in violation of antitrust laws, and should be broken up[4] to encourage competition in the market. In a leaked audio recording of a meeting from July, Zuckerberg said he would \"go to the mat and fight\"[5] over any push to break up Facebook Warren took to Twitter on Tuesday[6] to make the case for breaking up the social media conglomerate: \"Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security.\" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[7] United States presidential candidate Sen. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren is going after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. On Tuesday, The Verge's Casey Newton published a transcript[8] of audio leaked from a July town hall meeting where Zuckerberg told employees[9]that he would \"go to the mat and fight\" any regulation seeking to break up the social media giant. Zuckerberg was answering a question from an employee that directly addressed Warren's plan, introduced in early 2019[10], to break up so-called \"big tech\" companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Under Warren's proposed plan, Facebook would have to undo its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.\"If someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\" Zuckerberg told employees in July. \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge. And I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" Warren hit back at Zuckerberg's comments in a series of statements on Twitter[11] on Tuesday afternoon. \"Facebook is doing pretty well right now,\" she said. \"They've acquired potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram. More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook.They've got a lot of power \u2014 and face little competition or accountability.\" It's not clear what the source of the statistic is, but it appears to be pulled from the GlobalWebIndex 2018 report on social media[12]; the Warren campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for clarification. Read more: Elizabeth Warren's plan to regulate tech giants would force Facebook to break up with WhatsApp and Instagram[13] The messaging lines up with Warren's ongoing criticism of the so-called \"big tech\" companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. \"America's biggest tech companies are controlling more and more of our digital lives,\" Warren wrote in a campaign email in March announcing the plan. The subject line: \"It's time to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\" She got more specific in a series of tweets on Tuesday afternoon:\"My plan to #BreakUpBigTech would undo their illegal, anticompetitive mergers. You'll still be able to use Facebook and Instagram to catch up with friends and family and share photos of your dog. But they'll have to compete with each other to make a better product for you. Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security.\"\"Tech giants shouldn't be able to wield enough power to undermine our democracy,\" Warren said in a follow up tweet[14]. Facebook representatives did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Warren's statements.NOW WATCH: Here's why phone companies like Verizon and AT...harge more for extra data[15]See Also: Google just rolled out 3 new security features that let you limit what personal activity it tracks in apps like YouTube and Maps[16]Mark Zuckerberg reacted to the leaked transcript of his internal meeting by promoting it on his Facebook page[17]The curious TV made by smartphone company OnePlus is finally going on sale.

This comes just weeks after Amazon cancelled its plans to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, amid fierce backlash from progressive activists and local lawmakers. \"They think they can run their business to just roll right over every small business, every entrepreneur, every start-up that might threaten their position. And what does our government in Washington do?</p><p> Nothing,\" Warren told the crowd in Long Island City. 'We need big structural change in this country,\" Warren emphatically stated. Sen. Elizabeth Warren traveled to Long Island City, Queens \u2014 the very same neighborhood where Amazon was supposed to open one of its HQ2 centers before it cancelled the deal last month \u2014 on Friday night to talk to New Yorkers about her plan to break up America's biggest tech companies[1]. A substantive crowd showed up to hear the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate argue that massive tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google are undermining democracy with their monopoly power. \"They want to be the umpire and they want to run a bunch of teams in the game,\" Warren said of the tech giants. \"My view on this is you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.\" \"We have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth,\" Warren added. \"They think they can come to towns, cities, states and bully everyone into doing what they want. They think they can scoop up all of our personal data and sell it to whoever they want for whatever purposes. They think they can run their business to just roll right over every small business, every entrepreneur, every start-up that might threaten their position. And what does our government in Washington do? Nothing.' 'We need big structural change in this country,\" Warren emphatically stated. Many in the assembled crowd shared Warren's frustration with companies like Amazon. \"I didn't have a problem with Amazon coming to Long Island City in general, I just didn't like the way they were coming,\" William Hampton-Sosa, a professor at Brooklyn College, who lives in Long Island City told INSIDER. \"The agreements were done in secret, behind closed doors, they didn't engage the community. If they're going to come to New York City, that's fine. But don't ask for tax breaks, especially when you don't pay taxes.\" Luke Thomas, 33, a software developer who works in nearby Greenpoint, Brooklyn said he didn't have \"strong feelings\" about Amazon coming to Queens. However, he thinks breaking up the major tech companies won't hurt them too much saying, \"There's a rich tradition of breaking up monopolies.' Kim Clay, a 23-year-old law student, who lives two blocks from the Long Island City site that would have housed Amazon's HQ2 said she was worried about \"getting priced out\" of her apartment. The Friday night event wasn't a formal rally or speech. Instead it featured a number of local politicians, including New York City Council Deputy Leader Jimmy van Bramer and New York state senator Michael Gianaris \u2014 both vocal opponents of the deal to bring Amazon to New York. \"We were not elected to serve as Amazon drones,\" van Bramer and Gianaris, both of whom represent Long Island City, said in a statement[2] shortly after Amazon announced it had reached a deal to move into New York last fall. At Friday's event, Gianaris said, \"We brought the presidential campaign to our doorstep because we stood up to corporate greed in this neighborhood All we do is suffer while the rich get the heli-pads.\"A progressive backlash to Silicon ValleyOn Friday morning, Warren announced her plan to break up some of the largest US tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. It was no coincidence that Warren chose to debut the proposal in Long Island City \u2014 the same neighborhood that Amazon had plans to build a second headquarters. The tech giant pulled out of the deal last month[3] amid fierce opposition from local activists and lawmakers. The proposal includes a call for \"platform neutrality\" \u2014 barring tech giants from both providing a marketplace and selling their product on the same marketplace. And it would appoint new regulators to undo mergers they believe would smother competition. For example, the senator wants to break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest. Warren's aggressive move \u2014 and Amazon's recent cancellation of its Queens HQ2 \u2014 illustrates the progressive left's growing disillusion with Silicon Valley. Progressive New York lawmakers[4], including democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, responded to a grassroots backlash against the corporation's deal with the city and state, which included up to $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives in exchange for the creation of 25,000 jobs. This comes after Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized Amazon's treatment of its workers, particularly its lowest-wage employees. Reports have emerged[5] in recent years[6] that suggest grueling and even inhumane working conditions in Amazon's warehouses around the world. The company raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour[7] for all of its fulfillment center workers shortly after Sanders introduced a bill,[8] known as the Stop Bezos Act, which would tax large companies whose low-wage employees rely on government assistance.

Elizabeth Warren traveled to Long Island City, Queens - the very same neighborhood where Amazon was supposed to open one of its HQ2 centers before it cancelled the deal last month - on Friday night to talk to New Yorkers about her <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-plan-to-break-up-amazon-facebook-google-big-tech-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">plan to break up America's biggest tech companies</url>.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A substantive crowd showed up to hear the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate argue that massive tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google are undermining democracy with their monopoly power.\u00a0</p><p>\"They want to be the umpire and they want to run a bunch of teams in the game,\" Warren said of the tech giants. \"My view on this is you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.\"</p><p>\"We have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth,\" Warren added. \"They think they can come to towns, cities, states and bully everyone into doing what they want. They think they can scoop up all of our personal data and sell it to whoever they want for whatever purposes. They think they can run their business to just roll right over every small business, every entrepreneur, every start-up that might threaten their position. And what does our government in Washington do? Nothing.\"</p><p>\"We need big structural change in this country,\" Warren emphatically stated.\u00a0</p><p>Many in the assembled crowd shared Warren's frustration with companies like Amazon.</p><p>\"I didn't have a problem with Amazon coming to Long Island City in general, I just didn't like the way they were coming,\" William Hampton-Sosa, a professor at Brooklyn College, who lives in Long Island City told INSIDER. \"The agreements were done in secret, behind closed doors, they didn't engage the community. If they're going to come to New York City, that's fine. But don't ask for tax breaks, especially when you don't pay taxes.\"</p><p>Luke Thomas, 33, a software developer who works in nearby Greenpoint, Brooklyn said he didn't have \"strong feelings\" about Amazon coming to Queens. However, he thinks breaking up the major tech companies won't hurt them too much saying, \"There's a rich tradition of breaking up monopolies.\"</p><p>Kim Clay, a 23-year-old law student, who lives two blocks from the Long Island City site that would have housed Amazon's HQ2 said she was worried about \"getting priced out\" of her apartment.</p><p>The Friday night event wasn't a formal rally or speech. Instead it featured a number of local politicians, including New York City Council Deputy Leader Jimmy van Bramer and New York state senator Michael Gianaris - both vocal opponents of the deal to bring Amazon to New York.\u00a0</p><p>\"We were not elected to serve as Amazon drones,\" van Bramer and Gianaris, both of whom represent Long Island City, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.sg/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-and-other-nyc-democrats-slam-amazon-hq2-2018-11/\">said in a statement</url> shortly after Amazon announced it had reached a deal to move into New York last fall.\u00a0</p><p>At Friday's event, Gianaris said, \"We brought the presidential campaign to our doorstep because we stood up to corporate greed in this neighborhood ... All we do is suffer while the rich get the heli-pads.\"</p><h>A progressive backlash to Silicon Valley</h><p>On Friday morning, Warren announced her plan to break up some of the largest US tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. It was no coincidence that Warren chose to debut the proposal in Long Island City - the same neighborhood that Amazon had plans to build a second headquarters.\u00a0</p><p>The tech giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cancels-new-york-hq2-2019-2?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">pulled out of the deal last month</url> amid fierce opposition from local activists and lawmakers.\u00a0</p><p>The proposal includes a call for \"platform neutrality\" - barring tech giants from both providing a marketplace and selling their product on the same marketplace. And it would appoint new regulators to undo mergers they believe would smother competition.</p><p>For example, the senator wants to break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest.\u00a0</p><p>Warren's aggressive move - and Amazon's recent cancellation of its Queens HQ2 - illustrates the progressive left's growing disillusion with Silicon Valley.\u00a0</p><p>Progressive <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-celebrates-amazon-hq2-retreat-from-new-york-2019-2?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">New York lawmakers</url>, including democratic socialist Rep.

Well, that's if presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has her way. A few weeks ago Warren, who has been the policy table-setter of the Democratic primary thus far, unveiled a massive regulatory plan aimed directly at Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposal is designed to reign in major tech companies that have outsized power, both financially and over the public. Warren called out Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple for their business practices.</p><p>Warren made the policy speech in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York. Some may know Long Island City as Amazon's abandoned home for their second headquarters. Amazon held a dystopian sweepstakes in which seemingly every city in America competed to be the home of a corporation. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.)and Mayor Bill DeBlasio trotted out billions of dollars in tax incentives Amazon graciously accepted. Soon a grassroots opposition movement started - eventually leading to Amazon's withdrawal.</p><p>The regulations would break off several arms of these tech behemoths and increase scrutiny over acquisitions as well as banning the sharing of data to third parties. Warren's plan calls for two designations of tech companies. The first type makes between $90 million and $25 billion. The second type makes more than $25 billion. Once a company crosses that high threshold, it is forced to separate its key businesses. Increased regulation around acquisitions would allow the startup market to flourish, abolishing Facebook's strategy of acquiring over developing.</p><p>Under the proposal, Facebook would have to split apart WhatsApp and Instagram. Amazon would have to spin off both its main Amazon Marketplace and its line of consumer products, AmazonBasics. Google would be reformed into two separate businesses, Google Search and a platform for its ad business. Youtube and Waze, subsidiaries of Google, would also become independent companies. Apple, whose app store charges app-makers 30 to 50 percent on in-app subscriptions would be forced to either remove its apps from the store or relinquish that source of income.</p><p>One policy not in the proposal is the oligopolistic tactics surrounding the internet itself. Three companies control the bulk of servers where websites are hosted. Google, Amazon and Microsoft effectively are the internet's gatekeepers. They could shut down competing sites simply by charging them exorbitant rates to exist. This makes it hard for startups to compete. A rival marketplace could spring up on Amazon Web Services and even if it becomes successful, it has to pay Amazon every time they want to expand. This seems like the most obvious area for regulation.</p><p>The public desire for tech regulation has ballooned since the 2016 election. Facebook's omnipresence in the news after its constant mishandling of user data has led to a sea change. For the past decade, tech companies have been held in reverence in American society. They are seen as benevolent disruptors. They wear hoodies and work in bean bag chairs. Meanwhile these companies skate by on taxes and expose personal data. Google paid more money in fines to the European Union than it did in taxes last year. Amazon literally paid no taxes but was given billions in incentives to grace New York with its presence.</p><p>Facebook and Google must be reigned in through strict regulation. They control information seen by billions across the globe. In India, they call the internet \"Facebook.\" They cannot remain unchecked any longer and have proven that time and time again.</p><p>Warren will have no trouble getting people to support dismantling them. But Amazon and Apple may prove more difficult a case. People love Amazon. They deliver anything in two days' time, cheaper than most other marketplaces. Apple makes beautiful technology and actually does not share any user data with any third party.</p><p>Warren's plan is only a campaign proposal and by no means set in stone. The details are scant but the ideas are necessary. Warren touts herself as a capitalist and these proposed regulations are crucial for the tech sector to flourish - not only for the CEOs but for the workers and consumers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4116791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRS-B7J1-DY7P-T2JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Targum: Rutgers University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate, has proposed a plan to break up some of the country's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook. The plan calls for banning tech giants from both providing a marketplace and selling their product on the same marketplace, and the appointment of new regulators that would undo mergers between massive tech companies. </p><p>\"That means we break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest, and more,\" Warren wrote in a campaign email. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate, has proposed a plan to break up some of the country's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook, the campaign announced on Friday morning. Warren's plan includes a call for \"platform neutrality\" \u2014 banning tech giants from both providing a marketplace and selling their product on the same marketplace \u2014 and the appointment of new regulators that would undo mergers between massive tech companies. She argues that these mergers smother competition and undermine democracy. \"That means we break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest, and more,\" Warren wrote in a campaign email. The plan also bars companies from sharing users' data with third parties. Warren is holding a rally in Long Island City, Queens on Friday night, where Amazon was set to open a new headquarters before it cancelled its plans amid fierce local pushback. \"I want a government that makes sure everybody \u2014 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2014 plays by the rules,\" Warren said in a statement to the New York Times. \"To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\" The proposal would impose new regulations on two tiers of companies: those worth more than annual global revenue of $25 billion or higher, and those with revenue between $90 million and $25 billion. Warren is the first 2020 candidate to propose policy to reign in the power of tech giants. Other candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Amy Kobuchar, have voiced support for tighter regulations. \"Monopolies are a corruption of the marketplace. Breaking them up \u2014 allowing entrepreneurs to enter the market, giving consumers more choices, and giving workers more jobs \u2014 turns the Republican socialism attack on its head,\" Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren's presidential bid, said in a statement. And the move is the latest example of Warren's intense focus on policy. She's put forward several other sweeping policy proposals as part of her campaign, including a wealth tax[1] on the 75,000 richest families in the US and a sweeping child care proposal that the tax would help pay for.NOW WATCH: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is being praised for her line of questioning at Michael Cohen's hearing \u2014 watch it here[2]See Also: Several 2020 Democratic candidates are rushing to defend embroiled Rep.

Warren has campaigned on the argument that Facebook[1], Google[2], and Amazon[3] are monopolies that should be more heavily regulated. She also urged other presidential candidates to disclose how much tech executives are donating to their campaigns. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] Sen. Elizabeth Warren will no longer accept large donations from executives at big tech companies, the candidate announced[5] Tuesday. As part of a campaign push to \"clean up the corruption in our elections,\" Warren said she won't take campaign donations of more than $200 from executives of tech companies like Google and Facebook, or from finance executives. Warren has previously vowed not to take contributions of more than $200 from fossil fuel and pharmaceutical executives. \"Money slithers through every part of our political system, corrupting democracy and taking power away from the people,\" Warren wrote. \"Getting big money out of politics is a critical part of fighting corruption.\" Warren has made breaking up big tech a major facet of her campaign. The candidate has argued[6] that tech giants including Facebook, Google, and Amazon are monopolies that the federal government should regulate more heavily. That proposal received backlash from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said during an internal company meeting that a Warren presidency would \"suck\" for Facebook, according to an audio recording published by The Verge[7]. Warren has also sparred[8] with Facebook this week over its policy of not removing false advertisements made by political candidates. Read more: Apple is getting slammed by both Republicans and Democrats for pulling an app used by Hong Kong protesters to monitor police activity[9] But despite these public conflicts, Warren has garnered the support of many tech industry leaders. According to a report by Vox[10], Warren is building traction with Silicon Valley elites. The candidate's new stance rejecting big tech contributions appears to represent a public effort to distance herself from that influence. In her statement Tuesday, Warren also took aim at political candidates who would court big tech donations, implying that those donations could be traded for campaign positions or political favors. \"If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so \u2014 but they shouldn't be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors,\" Warren wrote.NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos is worth over $160 billion \u2014 here's how the world's richest man makes and spends his money[11]See Also: TikTok is Mark Zuckerberg's

Warren's proposals amount to a total rethink of the United States' exceptionally permissive merger and acquisition policy over the past four decades. Indeed, Big Tech is only the poster child for a significant increase in monopoly and oligopoly power across a broad swath of the American economy. Although the best approach is still far from clear, I could not agree more that something needs to done, especially when it comes to Big Tech's ability to buy out potential competitors and use their platform dominance to move into other lines of business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren is courageous because Big Tech is big money for most leading Democratic candidates, particularly progressives, for whom California is a veritable campaign-financing ATM. And although one can certainly object, Warren is not alone in thinking that the tech giants have gained excessive market dominance; in fact, it is one of the few issues in Washington on which there is some semblance of agreement. Other candidates, most notably Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have also taken principled stands.</p><p>Although the causal relationships are difficult to untangle, there are solid grounds for believing that the rise in monopoly power has played a role in exacerbating income inequality, weakening workers' bargaining power, and slowing the rate of innovation. And, perhaps outside of China, it is a global problem, because U.S. tech monopolies have often achieved market dominance before local regulators and politicians know what has happened. The European Union, in particular, has been trying to steer its own course on technology regulation. Recently, the United Kingdom commissioned an expert group, chaired by former President Barack Obama's chief economist (and now my colleague) Jason Furman, that produced a very useful report on approaches to the tech sector.</p><p>The debate about how to regulate the sector is eerily reminiscent of the debate over financial regulation in the early 2000s. Proponents of a light regulatory touch argued that finance was too complicated for regulators to keep up with innovation, and that derivatives trading allows banks to make wholesale changes to their risk profile in the blink of an eye. And the financial industry put its money where its mouth was, paying salaries so much higher than those in the public sector that any research assistant the Federal Reserve System trained to work on financial issues would be enticed with offers exceeding what their boss's boss was earning.</p><p>There will be similar problems staffing tech regulatory offices and antitrust legal divisions if the push for tighter regulation gains traction. To succeed, political leaders need to be focused and determined, and not easily bought. One only has to recall the 2008 financial crisis and its painful aftermath to comprehend what can happen when a sector becomes too politically influential. And the U.S. and world economy are, if anything, even more vulnerable to Big Tech than to the financial sector, owing both to cyber aggression and vulnerabilities in social media that can pervert political debate.</p><p>Another parallel with the financial sector is the outsize role of U.S. regulators. As with U.S. foreign policy, when they sneeze, the entire world can catch a cold. The 2008 financial crisis was sparked by vulnerabilities in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but quickly went global. A U.S.-based cyber crisis could easily do the same. This creates an \"externality,\" or global commons problem, because U.S. regulators allow risks to build up in the system without adequately considering international implications.</p><p>It is a problem that cannot be overcome without addressing fundamental questions about the role of the state, privacy, and how U.S. firms can compete globally against China, where the government is using domestic tech companies to collect data on its citizens at an exponential pace. And yet many would prefer to avoid them.</p><p>That's why there has been fierce pushback against Warren for daring to suggest that even if many services seem to be provided for free, there might still be something wrong. There was the same kind of pushback from the financial sector 15 years ago, and from the railroads back in the late 1800s. Writing in the March 1881 issue of The Atlantic, the progressive activist Henry Demarest Lloyd warned that, \"Our treatment of 'the railroad problem' will show the quality and caliber of our political sense. It will go far in foreshadowing the future lines of our social and political growth. It may indicate whether the American democracy, like all the democratic experiments which have preceded it, is to become extinct because the people had not wit enough or virtue enough to make the common good supreme.\"</p><p>Lloyd's words still ring true today. At this point, ideas for regulating Big Tech are just sketches, and of course more serious analysis is warranted. An open, informed discussion that is not squelched by lobbying dollars is a national imperative. The debate that Warren has joined is not about whether to establish socialism. It is about making capitalist competition fairer and, ultimately, stronger.</p><p>Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made every effort to rally left-wing populists to her cause\u2014from promising[1] to cancel student loan debt to breaking up[2] big tech companies. But one[3] of her latest efforts highlights a problem that continues to plague our society: the politicization of the criminal law.A New Corporate Accountability StructureOn April 3, Warren introduced the Corporate Executive Accountability Act. The bill[4] would make it a federal crime, punishable by a year's imprisonment for a first offense, for corporate executives and anyone else in a position of 'responsibility and authority' to 'negligently'\u2014that is, by accident\u2014'permit or fail to prevent' employee violations of any federal or state criminal law. </p><p>So, if a low-level employee defrauds a customer, Warren wants to hold the company's CEO personally and criminally liable, even if the CEO had no knowledge of the employee's crime. Warren is so eager to jail businessmen that she wants to do so even if no crime was committed at all. It's bad enough that Warren wants to lock someone up for someone else's crime, but it gets worse. Warren is so eager to jail businessmen that she wants to do so even if no crime was committed at all. She defines 'violation[s] of law' to include violations of civil law that 'affects the health, safety, finances, or personal data' of one percent of either the U.S. population or the population of any state. The bill places no limits on what 'affects' means, so it appears Warren would be comfortable sending people to prison for almost anything, even if the underlying conduct is not criminal.Expanding the LawUnder her proposal, deferred or non-prosecution agreements (which may or may not include an admission of criminal wrongdoing) or settlements in civil cases against companies could form the legal basis for sending people to prison. It should be noted that in many of these instances, corporations have not been found by a court to be criminally guilty of or civilly liable for alleged wrongdoing. It's no secret that Warren has repeatedly called for the imprisoning of big American bank CEOs and wants to break up any company she deems too big, but the Corporate Executive Accountability Act would reach well beyond Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Warren is potentially sweeping far lower in corporate hierarchies than the 'fat cat' CEOs she frequently vilifies. The bill applies to corporations that earn more than $1 billion in annual revenue, which would cover '[r]oughly 2,000 U.S. companies, employing nearly one-third of all workers,' as John Wood with the Chamber of Commerce recently noted[5] in The Wall Street Journal. It would also affect far more than just 'corporate executives.' Regulations[6]define 'executive officers' to mean a 'president, any vice president [and] any other officer who performs a policy making function.' Warren's bill would expressly make leaders outside of that broad category liable, meaning she is potentially sweeping far lower in corporate hierarchies than the 'fat cat' CEOs she frequently vilifies.Misusing Criminal LawWarren's proposal is, thankfully, unlikely to become law, but it reveals her willingness to inappropriately co-opt the criminal law to score easy political points with constituents. Unfortunately, she is not alone. In recent decades, the misuse of the criminal law has become all too common for our country's lawmakers. Since 1970, Congress has enacted[7] more than half of the 4,500 criminal laws in existence today. And although the number of crimes alone is staggering enough, the type of conduct that these laws prohibit is even more eye-opening. As former Attorney General Edwin Meese III has explained, the growing number of federal crimes is largely the result[8] of political pressure, as politicians don't want to be seen as 'soft on crime.' Politicians also know that 'feel good' legislation\u2014like the Corporate Executive Accountability Act\u2014gives the public a sense that 'something is being done' about something they do not like, even if that thing shouldn't be a crime in the first place. And although the number of crimes alone is staggering enough, the type of conduct that these laws prohibit is even more eye-opening. Anglo-American law has a long history of using the criminal code to condemn only those acts which are inherently immoral and wrongful, like arson, murder, and robbery.Civil vs. Criminal CrimesBut, unlike those crimes, federal criminal law today makes[9] crimes out of seemingly innocent or accidental conduct\u2014behavior which, at worst, warrants a civil fine. The Corporate Executive Accountability Act is of this same ilk. Corporate executives are not above the law, but this bill goes further than ensuring 'executive accountability.' It would impose harsh criminal penalties on corporate executives who, out of mere negligence (not malicious intent), fail to prevent the unlawful actions of their employees. As Wood, himself a former U.S. attorney, wrote[10] in his Wall Street Journal piece:I am all for prosecuting executives who knowingly engage in misconduct. But negligence is an extremely low standard normally reserved for civil enforcement and tort law. It means that a violation should have been avoided through greater care but was accidental. By definition, negligent executives are unaware of any wrongdoing.We agree that this is a radical proposal. There are signs that even Warren herself recognizes this fact, which is why she limited it to leaders in billion-dollar corporations.Inconsistent ApplicationAfter all, if Warren's genuine aim is corporate responsibility\u2014and not merely locking up millionaire CEOs\u2014shouldn't she be applying these standards fairly and evenly to every business, large or small? Warren seems to understand that even the most progressive voters sour on the 'lock 'em up' strategy when the cops stop going after big banks and big tech and start arresting mom and pop. In addition to worsening America's overcriminalization problem, the net effect is that entrepreneurs will spend a lot less time innovating and a lot more time looking over their shoulders and micro-managing their employees. Warren's proposal is an extreme example of the policy ramifications of liberals' collective leftward lurch. The opportunity costs of all that risk-aversion will be significant, and Americans will see fewer jobs created, fewer life-changing products and services brought to market, and a less vibrant economy overall. Warren's proposal is an extreme example of the policy ramifications of liberals' collective leftward lurch. It may prove popular with a progressive\u2014and increasingly, socialist\u2014base, but mainstream Americans should be alarmed by Warren's vision of an anti-business police state.

Since 1970, Congress has\u00a0enacted\u00a0more than half of the 4,500 criminal laws in existence today.<br/>As former Attorney General Edwin Meese III has explained, the growing number of federal crimes is largely the\u00a0result\u00a0of political pressure, as politicians don't want to be seen as \"soft on crime.\"<br/>Politicians also know that \"feel-good\" legislation-like the Corporate Executive Accountability Act-gives the public a sense that \"something is being done\" about something they do not like, even if that thing shouldn't be a crime in the first place.\u00a0<br/>And although the number of crimes alone is staggering enough, the type of conduct that these laws prohibit is even more eye-opening.<br/>Anglo-American law has a long history of using the criminal code to condemn only those acts which are inherently immoral and wrongful, like arson, murder, and robbery.\u00a0<br/>But, unlike those crimes, federal criminal law today\u00a0makes\u00a0crimes out of seemingly innocent or accidental conduct-behavior which, at worst, warrants a civil fine.<br/>The Corporate Executive Accountability Act is of this same ilk.\u00a0<br/>Corporate executives are not above the law, but this bill goes further than ensuring \"executive accountability.\" It would impose harsh criminal penalties on corporate executives who, out of mere negligence (not malicious intent), fail to prevent the unlawful actions of their employees.\u00a0<br/>As Wood, himself a former U.S. attorney,\u00a0wrote\u00a0in his Wall Street Journal piece:<br/>I am all for prosecuting executives who knowingly engage in misconduct. But negligence is an extremely low standard normally reserved for civil enforcement and tort law. It means that a violation should have been avoided through greater care but was accidental. By definition, negligent executives are unaware of any wrongdoing.<br/>We agree that this is a radical proposal. There are signs that even Warren herself recognizes this fact, which is why she limited it to leaders in billion-dollar corporations.<br/>After all, if Warren's genuine aim is corporate responsibility-and not merely locking up millionaire CEOs-shouldn't she be applying these standards fairly and evenly to every business, large or small? Warren seems to understand that even the most progressive voters sour on the \"lock 'em up\" strategy when the cops stop going after big banks and big tech, and start arresting mom and pop.<br/>In addition to worsening America's overcriminalization problem, the net effect is that entrepreneurs will spend a lot less time innovating and a lot more time looking over their shoulders and micro-managing their employees.\u00a0<br/>The opportunity costs of all that risk-aversion will be significant, and Americans will see fewer jobs created, fewer life-changing products and services brought to market, and a less vibrant economy overall.<br/>Warren's proposal is an extreme example of the policy ramifications of liberals' collective leftward lurch. It may prove popular with a progressive-and increasingly, socialist-base, but mainstream Americans should be alarmed by Warren's vision of an anti-business police state.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-60672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRR1-JCMP-5563-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Heritage Foundation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made every effort to rally left-wing populists to her cause-from promising to cancel student loan debt to breaking up big tech companies.<br/>But one of her latest efforts highlights a problem that continues to plague our society: the politicization of the criminal law.</p><p><br/>A New Corporate Accountability Structure<br/>On April 3, Warren introduced the Corporate Executive Accountability Act. The bill would make it a federal crime, punishable by a year's imprisonment for a first offense, for corporate executives and anyone else in a position of \"responsibility and authority\" to \"negligently\"-that is, by accident-\"permit or fail to prevent\" employee violations of any federal or state criminal law.<br/>So, if a low-level employee defrauds a customer, Warren wants to hold the company's CEO personally and criminally liable, even if the CEO had no knowledge of the employee's crime.<br/>Warren is so eager to jail businessmen that she wants to do so even if no crime was committed at all.<br/>It's bad enough that Warren wants to lock someone up for someone else's crime, but it gets worse.<br/>Warren is so eager to jail businessmen that she wants to do so even if no crime was committed at all. <br/>She defines \"violation[s] of law\" to include violations of civil law that \"affects the health, safety, finances, or personal data\" of one percent of either the U.S. population or the population of any state. The bill places no limits on what \"affects\" means, so it appears Warren would be comfortable sending people to prison for almost anything, even if the underlying conduct is not criminal.<br/>Expanding the Law<br/>Under her proposal, deferred or non-prosecution agreements (which may or may not include an admission of criminal wrongdoing) or settlements in civil cases against companies could form the legal basis for sending people to prison. It should be noted that in many of these instances, corporations have not been found by a court to be criminally guilty of or civilly liable for alleged wrongdoing.<br/>It's no secret that Warren has repeatedly called for the imprisoning of big American bank CEOs and wants to break up any company she deems too big, but the Corporate Executive Accountability Act would reach well beyond Wall Street and Silicon Valley.<br/>Warren is potentially sweeping far lower in corporate hierarchies than the \"fat cat\" CEOs she frequently vilifies.<br/>The bill applies to corporations that earn more than $1 billion in annual revenue, which would cover \"[r]oughly 2,000 U.S. companies, employing nearly one-third of all workers,\" as John Wood with the Chamber of Commerce recently noted in The Wall Street Journal.<br/>It would also affect far more than just \"corporate executives.\" Regulations\u00a0define \"executive officers\" to mean a \"president, any vice president ... [and] any other officer who performs a policy making function.\" Warren's bill would expressly make leaders outside of that broad category liable, meaning she is potentially sweeping far lower in corporate hierarchies than the \"fat cat\" CEOs she frequently vilifies.<br/>Misusing Criminal Law<br/>Warren's proposal is, thankfully, unlikely to become law, but it reveals her willingness to inappropriately co-opt the criminal law to score easy political points with constituents.<br/>Unfortunately, she is not alone. In recent decades, the misuse of the criminal law has become all too common for our country's lawmakers.

Productivity growth, a key gauge of economic health, remains historically low. Median wages, an indicator of middle-class living standards, have barely grown in four decades. Inequality is high, and market power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few companies. Americans used to dismiss Europe as the land of government-protected, noncompetitive firms. Now, European markets in most industries appear more competitive than those in the United States.</p><p><br/>The complacency of America's political class has exacerbated these problems. For years, two trite approaches have dominated economic-policy debates. The right has clung to a belief in \"trickle-down\" growth, which translates into doing whatever is good for business, because corporate profitability will boost investment, employment, and wages. But it turns out that serving established corporations' interests and eschewing regulation does not encourage competition or spur the kind of innovation needed to boost productivity growth. Siding with bosses at the expense of workers and consumers may be good for shareholders, but it doesn't deliver healthy wage growth for average Americans.<br/>The left, meanwhile, has focused primarily on redistribution, most recently seizing on proposals for a wealth tax with which to finance more generous transfers or even a universal basic income. There is little doubt that the US economy needs more infrastructure investment, a better social safety net, and stronger anti-poverty measures. Taxes on the rich have reached record lows at a time when the US is in dire need of more federal-government revenue and spending. Yet, historically, no society has achieved broadly shared prosperity from redistribution alone.<br/>Rather, shared prosperity has typically rested on three pillars. The first is fiscal redistribution, whereby taxes on the rich are used to provide public services and transfers to the needy. The second is a plentiful supply of jobs with relatively high pay and some degree of stability, which in turn depends on the presence of laws protecting workers (otherwise employers will shift toward lower-quality, lower-pay jobs).<br/>The third pillar is steady productivity growth, which is necessary for bolstering wage growth across the population. Wage-boosting productivity growth requires a specific form of technological change: the kind that is not narrowly aimed at eliminating workers from the production process. But it also requires regulations to prevent one or a few firms from achieving excessive dominance in an industry or over the whole economy.<br/>Until now, a \"good jobs\" agenda has been largely absent from political debates. But in a recent campaign speech, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, checked all the right boxes. Departing somewhat from her previous focus on taxing the super-rich and redistribution, Warren emphasised the importance of broad-based growth, and even identified some of the structural problems underlying stagnant US productivity.<br/>One hopes this speech represents a turning point for Warren's campaign, and for the Democrats generally. But even if it does, Democrats need to go further in addressing the root causes of US economic malaise. Warren is correct to worry about corruption and market concentration (particularly in the tech industry). And she is right to advocate stronger protections for workers and giving labour more of a voice in corporate governance. But she still has offered only a partial solution.<br/>Imagine that the federal minimum wage was increased to $18 per hour, and that workers were given seats on corporate boards. The fundamental productivity problem would remain, only now many firms would automate even more tasks and reduce their workforces. That's why any strategy for changing the technological trajectory of the economy must include protections for workers. Labour's share of national income has fallen sharply over the last two decades for two reasons: firms' large-scale replacement of workers with machines, and workers' simultaneous loss of bargaining power.<br/>Automation does of course lead to faster productivity growth, but not when it is pursued excessively \u2013 that is, when companies automate processes that could still be carried out more productively by humans. When companies focus solely on automation, they risk missing out on the gains that otherwise would have come from technologically augmenting their workers' productivity.<br/>The question, then, is why there has been such a push toward automation in the US economy. For starters, US tax policies have come to subsidise capital investments, which has created a perverse scenario in which firms can actually profit from using less productive machines, because payroll is taxed whereas the adoption of robots is subsidised via various tax credits and accelerated depreciation allowances. Moreover, the prevailing corporate business model, especially that of Big Tech firms, is now charting the course of technological development for the entire economy. The more corporate America focuses on automation, the less investment there will be in technologies that could be used to enhance worker productivity.<br/>At the same time, public support for basic research and development has declined precipitously in recent decades. Historically, government funding has played a critical role in determining not only how much research is conducted, but also its direction. Many of the most consequential innovations of the postwar era \u2013 from early computers and antibiotics to sensors and the Internet \u2013 were spearheaded by government demand and sustained by generous government support. These breakthroughs created new productive opportunities for workers, and fuelled the growth of good jobs in the economy. With public funding now dwindling, new research has increasingly clustered around existing paradigms and followed the path of least resistance toward labour-replacing automation.<br/>To be effective, then, a 21st century economic-policy agenda must shape the direction of technological development and deployment, and restore workers' bargaining power. Fortunately, the two goals are complementary. Business as usual, with big firms setting the agenda, will lead to ever-more automation, whereas a greater voice for workers, combined with a more democratically determined innovation strategy, would position the US both to increase productivity and generate better opportunities for the majority of citizens.<br/>One hopes that Warren's change of focus is the first step in this direction. - Project Syndicate<br/><br/>* Daron Acemoglu, Professor of Economics at MIT, is co-author (with James A.

Warren also said she would reverse mega mergers, like Facebook's ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram, the merger of Amazon with Whole Foods and Zappos, along with Google's acquisition of companies like Waze.</p><p>Sen. Warren is right that the business monopolies these companies enjoy are bad for other American businesses and ultimately reduce the choices of consumers. But there's another kind of power these tech companies all have that is an even bigger threat: their monopoly on information. Warren's proposal doesn't fully fix this larger problem.</p><p>First, these tech companies largely determine what we find on search engines or news feeds when we search for information to make decisions -- like who to vote for or where to seek medical treatment. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 90% of Americans use the Internet. As Sen. Warren notes in her proposal, Google and Facebook own the sites that receive over 70% of the traffic on the Internet. So they certainly have a monopoly on the information Americans access. And they have structured their algorithms so that the information people see on their sites is at least partly determined by their own business interests.</p><p>For example, companies and politicians who buy ads jump to the top of Google search results, regardless of whether a person searching for information online might be better served by seeing other sites first. In a 1998 paper, Google's own founders, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, highlighted this conflict when they noted that if someone searches the words \"cellular phone\" on a search engine that sells ads to cell phone companies -- like Google -- the search engine would have incentives not to show a study about how cell phones dangerously distract drivers first.</p><p>Sen. Warren's proposal to have the Google search engine split off from its ad business would only partially solve this problem. Most people don't scroll very far down search engine results so if we want Americans to be well informed and to easily access a broad spectrum of information when they make important decisions, we need laws that prevent search engine companies from designing algorithms to favor their advertisers or information that serves their own political interests.</p><p>Second, big tech companies have vast troves of personal information -- from the medical symptoms we search for on Google to the pictures of our kids that we post on Facebook. And it's clear after hacks and other unintended breaches that they aren't very good at safeguarding it. In October, for example, Google announced it would shutter its social network Google Plus after admitting that a software problem exposed the personal information of up to half a million of its users to outside developers. Another bug, which was fixed after six days, exposed user data from a shocking 52.5 million accounts.</p><p>Sen. Warren argued that reversing some of the mergers she seeks to break up would \"put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy.\"</p><p>She's right that more competition could result in new startup companies that better protect personal information, which could put market pressure on companies like Google and Facebook to improve their own security controls. But what's also needed is for government regulators to oversee how all this data is stored to ensure that it's better protected. Sen. Warren, who created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect Americans from financial institutions, would be well placed to propose a regulatory structure for technology companies.</p><p>In addition to more safeguards from unintended breaches, Americans should have more choices about what companies like Facebook and Google do with our data. In December, for example, the New York Times revealed that Facebook had been sharing the data of its users with other companies, including Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and even foreign entities like the Chinese telecom company Huawei and Russian search giant Yandex.</p><p>Sen. Warren's proposal wouldn't allow large tech companies to share user data with third parties. That's a great first step, but it still doesn't give Americans enough choices about how their data is harvested and used.</p><p>Facebook, for example, gathers user data internally which it uses to sell ads to third parties. Last year, Cambridge Analytica -- a company the Trump campaign hired during the 2016 presidential election -- accessed user data without permission. That data was then used to create \"psychographic profiles\" of users to predict their voting behavior. Even if third parties couldn't access such data anymore, nothing in Sen. Warren's proposal would prevent Facebook from doing the same thing itself.</p><p>As I've argued before, platforms like Google and Facebook have become so necessary to our ability to find jobs, access other essential information and stay connected to other people that we need more choices than our current options. We shouldn't have to choose between either access to information or privacy -- we should have options that provide both.</p><p>Sen. Warren acknowledged her proposal \"won't solve every problem we have with our big tech companies.\" She also recognized that Americans need \"more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold.?\" She should follow up with a bill that would give us such choices.</p><p>Sen. Warren is on the right track by calling for these monopolies to be broken up. And her proposal takes the important first step of limiting how our data can be shared with third parties. But she shouldn't stop there.

Warren has made challenging the power of the industry's largest players a key piece of her campaign. The billboard is near a station for the rail line many tech workers use to commute to their jobs in the city. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren is taking her message of breaking up the big-tech giants directly to those most affected by the companies. The senator's presidential campaign has posted a billboard in San Francisco touting her stance against the industry's behemoths. The advertisement is half a block away from the city's main station for Caltrain, the commuter rail line many tech workers ride on their way to and from their jobs in the city or in Silicon Valley. \"Break up big tech,\" the sign reads, then asks people to text the campaign to \"join our fight.\" The campaign posted the ad days before Warren is slated to visit the Bay Area. She's scheduled to hold a town hall in Oakland on Friday and to appear at both the California Democratic Convention and a MoveOn event in San Francisco Saturday. Warren campaign representative Saloni Sharma did not respond to questions about why the campaign decided to post the billboard with its particular message in San Francisco near the station. Instead, in an email, she echoed Warren's warning about the dangers of the big-tech companies. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power,\" Sharma said. She continued: \"Elizabeth's plan would help ensure tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.\" Warren has made challenging the power of the tech giants a centerpiece of her campaign[2]. She's called for breaking up the larger companies[3], including Facebook and Amazon, and more strictly regulating smaller ones. Read this: Elizabeth Warren pulled a ninja move to turn tech angst into a crackdown with real teeth, and tech is going to suffer even if she's not president[4] It's unclear how Warren's message will play in San Francisco. The city and the Bay Area are ground zero for the tech industry and home to many of its largest companies, including Facebook, Google, and Apple. But the region has also suffered from many of the consequences of the industry's immense wealth, including sky-high housing costs, gridlocked traffic, overstuffed transit systems, and displacement of non-tech residents. Such factors have led to a burbling backlash by some longtime residents against the tech industry. Got a tip about the tech industry?

Our scoring system factors the percentage of operated production by commodity to its US holdings plus the relative percentage of future permits on federal lands. For integrateds and international companies, we weighted the ranking based on ebitda/PV-10/production contribution/value.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>And, drum roll please, the table in question:</p><p>RBC focused on federal land because it believes that implementing such a ban is possible by executive action. They are more sceptical about the potential for such a policy to cover private land.</p><p>Of course, there is a still question over fracking\u2019s commercial viability. A <url normalizedValue=\"http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/U.S.-Fracking-Sector-Disappoints-Yet-Again_August2019.pdf\"> study</url> by\u00a0Sightline Institute and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) in August found that, of 29 fracking-focused oil and gas companies, only 11 produced positive free cash flow in the second quarter. The aggregate amount was a measly $26m.\u00a0</p><p>So if current trends continue (and given how mature the sector is now, there\u2019s no reason to suggest fortunes will change), perhaps the market will do Senator Warren\u2019s bidding for her, regardless of whether she goes on to win the Presidency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-d13ca0b2c3c242288c4d31d1ab87f85e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8H-0361-DXP9-9167-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0008B2C</classCode><className>RBC DOMINION SECURITIES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001NUE</classCode><className>RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren released an aggressive plan on Friday to break up tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook, targeting the power of Silicon Valley with her populist message as sprawling Internet giants face mounting political backlash ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, forcing Amazon and Google to spin off parts of their companies and relinquish their overwhelming control over online commerce. The plan also aims to unwind some of the highest profile mergers in the industry, like the combinations of Amazon and Whole Foods, and Google and DoubleClick, as well as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>The proposal from the Democratic presidential candidate is sure to rankle Silicon Valley executives and investors as well as opponents of government regulations, while drawing applause from progressive activists, consumer advocates and a range of lawmakers who have railed against what they see as unsustainable monopolies in the industry.</p><p>Warren's presidential campaign shared with CNN details of the plan, which outlines specific measures to break up large tech companies. It marks the Massachusetts Democrat's third major policy unveiling so far this year and is yet another sign that the progressive firebrand intends to set herself apart in a growing Democratic field by laying out an ambitious agenda centered around her campaign's overarching theme of dismantling wealthy and powerful interests.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post about the proposal. \"That's why my Administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition?including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.\"</p><p>According to a source familiar with her plans, Warren is expected to promote the new proposal Friday evening in Long Island City, where Amazon recently backed out of its plan to build a massive campus after facing intense political backlash. The senator is also headed to the South by Southwest Conference in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.</p><p>Pressed on whether it was a mistake for the Obama administration to approve some of the major tech mergers that she now wants to unwind, Warren told CNN in an interview Friday afternoon in Harlem: \"I don't think it's the right decision.\"</p><p>\"I want the regulators to go back and look,\" Warren said. \"I think the right decision is to say competition is protected if, once you get that big, you're not allowed to eat your competitors.\"</p><p>Asked what her message would be for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Warren responded: \"Good for you. You've built a great company. But you don't get to use the benefits of having built a platform to suck up information about every buyer and every seller and then use that information that nobody else can get access to -- to let you out-compete the next little business that's trying to get a foothold.\"</p><p>The senator declined to directly answer the question of whether she would have supported Amazon choosing Boston as the site of its second headquarters. \"What I'm not okay with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues, to build special goods,\" she told CNN.</p><p>Warren's proposal was greeted with a cheer from New York State Sen. Julia Salazar, a Democratic Socialist ally of freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a vocal opponent of New York's deal to bring Amazon's second headquarters to Queens.</p><p>\"I'm glad to see the dangers of monopolistic market power being taken seriously by a leading presidential candidate,\" Salazar said in a statement. \"Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other pro-Amazon politicians need to see the danger of sublimating all facets of our daily lives into a single all-encompassing company, which is clearly Amazon's business model.\"</p><p>The proposal is likely to spur debate in the rest of the Democratic field, which includes hard-charging candidates like Warren but also others who have taken substantial sums of money from Silicon Valley. A Warren aide told CNN the senator has not yet discussed her proposal with colleagues in Congress.</p><p>The plan would pose existential threats to the business models that turned certain giant tech firms into money spigots.</p><p>Separating Google's ad business from its Search function, for example, would make Google ads -- on which the company depends for nearly all of its revenue -- much less valuable. So would requiring Google to divest DoubleClick, the company it acquired in 2008 that vastly expanded the reach of its advertising network.</p><p>Warren's proposal would also prevent Amazon from selling its own branded products through its platform, resulting in lost revenue for the company but not killing the business model of taking a cut of every other transaction on the website. The move would alleviate one of the biggest concerns of other sellers on the marketplace -- that Amazon can determine which products are featured and promoted more prominently.</p><p>Warren's use of the $25 billion in annual revenue as a measure is notable because currently, antitrust enforcement largely depends on complex and ambiguous legal tests around factors like market share and evidence of price gouging.</p><p>\"I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish,\" Warren wrote in the Medium post. \"To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"</p><p>Ahead of Warren's visit to New York on Friday, State Sen. Mike Gianaris, who represents Long Island City and whose opposition threatened to scuttle Amazon's deal before the company retreated, said, \"I am proud the progressive movement in our country runs through Queens. It's only natural that Presidential candidates are spreading their message in western Queens and I look forward to hearing what Senator Warren has to offer.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190307elizabeth-warren-amazon-google-facebook1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-JKR1-DY60-M0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><timeReceived>1:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren released an aggressive plan on Friday to break up tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook, targeting the power of Silicon Valley with her populist message as sprawling Internet giants face mounting political backlash ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, forcing Amazon and Google to spin off parts of their companies and relinquish their overwhelming control over online commerce. The plan also aims to unwind some of the highest profile mergers in the industry, like the combinations of Amazon and Whole Foods, and Google and DoubleClick, as well as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>The proposal from the Democratic presidential candidate is sure to rankle Silicon Valley executives and investors as well as opponents of government regulations, while drawing applause from progressive activists, consumer advocates and a range of lawmakers who have railed against what they see as unsustainable monopolies in the industry.</p><p>Warren's presidential campaign shared with CNN details of the plan, which outlines specific measures to break up large tech companies. It marks the Massachusetts Democrat's third major policy unveiling so far this year and is yet another sign that the progressive firebrand intends to set herself apart in a growing Democratic field by laying out an ambitious agenda centered around her campaign's overarching theme of dismantling wealthy and powerful interests.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post about the proposal. \"That's why my Administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition---including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.\"</p><p>According to a source familiar with her plans, Warren is expected to promote the new proposal Friday evening in Long Island City, where Amazon recently backed out of its plan to build a massive campus after facing intense political backlash. The senator is also headed to the South by Southwest Conference in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.</p><p>Pressed on whether it was a mistake for the Obama administration to approve some of the major tech mergers that she now wants to unwind, Warren told CNN in an interview Friday afternoon in Harlem: \"I don't think it's the right decision.\" </p><p>\"I want the regulators to go back and look,\" Warren said. \"I think the right decision is to say competition is protected if, once you get that big, you're not allowed to eat your competitors.\"</p><p>Asked what her message would be for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Warren responded: \"Good for you. You've built a great company. But you don't get to use the benefits of having built a platform to suck up information about every buyer and every seller and then use that information that nobody else can get access to -- to let you out-compete the next little business that's trying to get a foothold.\"</p><p>The senator declined to directly answer the question of whether she would have supported Amazon choosing Boston as the site of its second headquarters. \"What I'm not okay with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues, to build special goods,\" she told CNN. </p><p>Warren's proposal was greeted with a cheer from New York State Sen. Julia Salazar, a Democratic Socialist ally of freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a vocal opponent of New York's deal to bring Amazon's second headquarters to Queens.</p><p>\"I'm glad to see the dangers of monopolistic market power being taken seriously by a leading presidential candidate,\" Salazar said in a statement. \"Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other pro-Amazon politicians need to see the danger of sublimating all facets of our daily lives into a single all-encompassing company, which is clearly Amazon's business model.\"</p><p>The proposal is likely to spur debate in the rest of the Democratic field, which includes hard-charging candidates like Warren but also others who have taken substantial sums of money from Silicon Valley. A Warren aide told CNN the senator has not yet discussed her proposal with colleagues in Congress. </p><p>The plan would pose existential threats to the business models that turned certain giant tech firms into money spigots.</p><p>Separating Google's ad business from its Search function, for example, would make Google ads -- on which the company depends for nearly all of its revenue -- much less valuable. So would requiring Google to divest DoubleClick, the company it acquired in 2008 that vastly expanded the reach of its advertising network.</p><p>Warren's proposal would also prevent Amazon from selling its own branded products through its platform, resulting in lost revenue for the company but not killing the business model of taking a cut of every other transaction on the website. The move would alleviate one of the biggest concerns of other sellers on the marketplace -- that Amazon can determine which products are featured and promoted more prominently.</p><p>Warren's use of the $25 billion in annual revenue as a measure is notable because currently, antitrust enforcement largely depends on complex and ambiguous legal tests around factors like market share and evidence of price gouging. </p><p>\"I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish,\" Warren wrote in the Medium post. \"To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"</p><p>Ahead of Warren's visit to New York on Friday, State Sen. Mike Gianaris, who represents Long Island City and whose opposition threatened to scuttle Amazon's deal before the company retreated, said, \"I am proud the progressive movement in our country runs through Queens. It's only natural that Presidential candidates are spreading their message in western Queens and I look forward to hearing what Senator Warren has to offer.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Elizabeth Warren's campaign released a political ad[1] that opens with leaked audio of Facebook Inc. (FB[2]) CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaking about how the company would \"go to the mat and fight\" if Warren is elected president in 2020 and tries to break up the firm. The clip, a part of two hours of audio from employee meetings held in July obtained by The Verge[3], was used to demonstrate how she has Big Tech rattled.Warren believes weak antitrust enforcement in the U.S. has helped big technology companies cement their dominance and hurt competition and innovation in the sector. </p><p>According to her, the lack of choices for consumers has allowed these tech giants to neglect privacy and user experience. Here's how she plans to defang the FAANGs[4] and even the playing field. The Plan  Among Warren's 48 plans[5], is the \"How we can break up Big Tech\" plan. According to her, companies acquire smaller rivals and use their proprietary online marketplaces to unfairly limit competition. Her plan to fix this consists of two main parts and some goals for the future: Online Marketplaces = Platform Utilities Warren wants to pass legislation that requires online marketplaces run by companies with annual global revenue above $90 million to be designated as \"platform utilities.\" Companies with annual global revenue above $25 billion will not be allowed to own platform utilities and participants on it at the same time. In other words, companies will not be able to sell services on a public marketplace they own and control. Platform utilities will have to treat all users fairly and equally. If sued and found guilty of violating the neutrality requirement, they would have to pay a fine equal to 5% of their annual revenue. Reversing mergers Warren will also appoint federal regulators who will reverse \"illegal\" and \"anti-competitive\" mergers. Goals Her three goals are to give people more control over how their personal data is collected, shared, and sold, help news outlets and artists keep more of the value their content generates, and ensure that no foreign power uses social media to influence U.S. elections. What the Plan Means for the FAANGs  Facebook: Under Warren's plan, Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram and 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp would be reversed, something Zuckerberg called an \"existential\" threat. \"Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy,\" says Warren's campaign website.Seventy percent of U.S. adults and 51% of U.S. teens use Facebook, according to Pew Research[6]. However, 70% of U.S. teens use Instagram, the platform Facebook is using to compete with the likes of Snap Inc. and TikTok. The company will be depending on Instagram to drive ad revenue in the coming years.Amazon: Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[7]) would not be allowed to sell its own products alongside third-party sellers on Amazon.com, if Warren's legislation is passed. Its privately-owned brands, like AmazonBasics, would have to be spun off or shuttered. Its mergers with Whole Foods (2017) and Zappos (2009) would also be unwound.Most of the hundreds of brands Amazon owns haven't had too much success, but Oweise Khazi, senior principal at Gartner L2, told Retail Dive[8] that Amazon is \"playing the long game\" and will be studying the massive amount of data it has access to.Apple: Apple Inc. (AAPL[9]) is not among the companies mentioned on Warren's official campaign website, but the AppStore would also qualify as a platform utility. This means Apple would not be able to sell its own applications, like Apple Music and Apple News, on the platform. 'It's got to be one or the other,' said Warren when asked about it by The Verge[10]. 'Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.' This would come in the way Apple's Services business ambitions.Netflix: Netflix Inc. (NFLX[11]) faces little regulatory risk at this point. In March 2019, BMO Capital Markets made Netflix its top technology stock instead of Amazon for this reason, according to CNBC[12]. The debate about whether the company is a budding monopoly[13] with its massive original content budget is still ongoing.Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[14]): Google's Ad Exchange and Google Searchare both platform utilities under the proposed law and would need to be spun off. Alternatively, Google would have to stop including its own comparison shopping service, restaurant ratings etc. in search results, because it would be competing with other companies like Yelp, and separate its business from Ad Exchange. Its acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick would also be unwound. How Did the Movement Begin?  Elizabeth Warren hasn't been talking about tech monopolies for nearly as long as she's been talking about breaking up big banks. Her viral video from the second Code Conference in 2015[15] doesn't show her mention concentration in Silicon Valley. A year later, however, during a keynote speech at think tank New America's forum on monopolies, Warren criticized tech giants[16] for \"snuffing out competition\" for the first time, and she made headlines. She said, \"Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world and every day they deliver enormous value. They deserve to be highly profitable and successful. But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors who want their chance to change the world again.' She provided examples, like Amazon steering consumers to books it published, Apple's treatment of rival music streaming companies like Spotify and Google giving preferential treatment to its products in its search engine. Her speech is still available to read online.[17]But where did the inspiration come from? The New Yorker[18] reported that in early 2016 Warren met with New America's Open Markets program head, Barry Lynn, and one of its legal fellows Lina Khan. They talked about the dominance of certain conglomerates, and Khan and Lynn recommended breaking up some of these giant companies. (Open Markets later split from New America after the former criticized Google, one of the think tank's key funders.)Unlike the European Union, U.S. antitrust activity has shrunk since the 1970s, and Warren is contributing to its resurgence in a huge way. At the time of her speech, Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias[19] called her proposal to increase antitrust scrutiny on the technology sector \"politically riskier than what Obama has done\" and a \"decisive break with a generation-long consensus that antitrust policy should be closely linked to consumer welfare rather than simply intervening in companies' fights with each other.\"In October 2016, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton added \"A new commitment to promote competition, address excessive concentration and the abuse of economic power, and reinvigorating antitrust laws and enforcement' to her list of campaign goals. In December, The New York Times ran an op-ed titled \"Forget AT...The Real Monopolies Are Google and Facebook.\"[20] It was the year Big Tech officially became one of the biggest bipartisan targets.

Elizabeth Warren appeared at a famed tech conference to detail how Amazon (and tech giants like it) now have a monopoly similar to that of the railroad in the early 1900s, which had to be broken up by President Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren believes her proposal could break up tech giants in the same way\u2014and, in essence, \u201cprotect competitive markets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have companies now like Amazon\u2014we\u2019ll use that as the example\u2014that have a platform,\u201d said Warren. \u201cBut Amazon does something besides providing the platform or marketplace. They also suck out an incredible amount of information about every buyer and every seller.\u201d</p><p>After Amazon and the like gather massive amounts of information about buyers and sellers, they use that information to dominate new marketers, Warren explained. \u201c[They] drive out of business partly because they get this incredible advantage from having the information of the platform and the incredible ability to manipulate the platform,\u201d said Warren. \u201cThat is to put themselves right at the top of page one\u2014and put that competitor back at page 16, where nobody ever goes.\u201d</p><p>By putting regulation in place and breaking up the tech monopoly of Google, Amazon, Facebook and others, Warren argues that it will level the playing field and drive innovation and growth for smaller brands and entrepreneurs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little like baseball,\u201d said Warren. \u201cYou can be an umpire [a platform] or you can own teams [brands]. But you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game.\u201d</p><p>The principle, she explained, is to \u201cbreak those apart. You can work for a platform. You can work for one of the teams, but if you work for one of the teams, you compete like everyone else in America. The whole idea behind this is actually for tech entrepreneurs, [for] people who have small businesses and want to grow them into big businesses.\u201d</p><p>Warren continued: \u201cIt says we want to keep that marketplace competitive and not let a giant who has a complete advantage\u2014and a manipulative advantage\u2014be able to snuff you out. I\u2019m deeply concerned right now that the space around companies like Amazon, Facebook [and] Google is now referred to by venture capitalists as the \u2018kill zone\u2019 because if you try to step a small business into that, one of two things happens: It gets bought up before it shows its worth or growth, or it just gets wiped out.\u201d</p><p>Venture capitalist funding in the tech space, per Warren, has dropped by 20 percent in recent years due to the domination of platform giants.</p><p>\u201cBreak those things apart, and we will have a much more robust and competitive market in America,\u201d said Warren. \u201cThat\u2019s how capitalism should work.\u201d</p><p>Warren also questioned Google\u2019s purchase of connected home device company Nest. \u201cWhy would a giant buy a company like Nest?\u201d she posed. \u201cMaybe because it\u2019s got the business model. But maybe it has a bucket of information embedded in it about when you wake up, when you go to bed, whether or not someone is homesick and 58 bazillion other things.\u201d</p><p>When tech giants like Amazon, Google and others have that level of information about buyers, sellers, consumer habits and more, it has repercussions for competitive markets, explained Warren.</p><p>\u201cThe consequence of that is we have to think about competitive markets,\u201d said Warren. \u201c[We\u2019re] protecting competitive markets by breaking these giants up. But it also means the urgency of new approaches and new laws and new restrictions around data, data privacy [and] data sales.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1029423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKW-YNN1-DYRK-H2YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 9, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Since Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017, the grocery chain has undergone some major changes[6].
