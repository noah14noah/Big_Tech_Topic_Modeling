Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p>The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p>We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p>But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p>But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p>There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p>Here is the President in his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p>REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p>How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p>Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p>Good to see you guys.</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p>But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p>REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p>He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p>REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p>HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p>REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p>KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p>REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p>KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p>REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p>KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p>REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p>KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p>REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p>KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p>On top of that, only two percent --</p><p>REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p>KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p>REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p>KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p>REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p>I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p>And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p>REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p>REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p>And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p>The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p>One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p>So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p>Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p>REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p>REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p>Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p>REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p>REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p>REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p>Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p>REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p>REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p>But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p>But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p>REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p>REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p>Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p>And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p>You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p>You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p>LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p>But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p>Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p>You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p>TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p>Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p>Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p>President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p>I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p>TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p>But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p>TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p>Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p>The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p>Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p>Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p>REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p>WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p>Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p> The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p> We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p> But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p> But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p> There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p> Here is the President in his own words.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p> Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p> REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p> How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p> Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p> Good to see you guys.</p><p> FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p> But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p> REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p> He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p> REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p> HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p> REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p> KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p> REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p> KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p> REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p> KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p> REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p> KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p> REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p> KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p> On top of that, only two percent --</p><p> REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p> KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p> REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p> KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p> REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p> I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p> And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p> REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p> REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p> And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p> The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p> One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p> And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p> So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p> Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p> REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p> REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p> Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p> REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p> REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p> REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p> Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p> REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p> REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p> But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p> But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p> REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p> REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p> Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p> MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p> Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p> And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p> You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p> REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p> You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p> LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p> But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p> Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p> You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p> TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p> Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p> Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p> President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p> I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p> TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p> But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p> TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p> Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p> The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p> Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p> Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p> DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p> REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p> WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p> Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p> The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p> We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p> But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p> But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p> There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p> Here is the President in his own words.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p> Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p> REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p> How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p> Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p> Good to see you guys.</p><p> FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p> But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p> REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p> He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p> REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p> HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p> REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p> KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p> REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p> KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p> REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p> KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p> REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p> KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p> REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p> KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p> On top of that, only two percent --</p><p> REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p> KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p> REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p> KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p> REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p> I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p> And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p> REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p> REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p> And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p> The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p> One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p> And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p> So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p> Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p> REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p> REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p> Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p> REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p> REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p> REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p> Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p> REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p> REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p> But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p> But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p> REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p> REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p> Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p> MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p> Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p> And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p> You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p> REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p> You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p> LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p> But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p> Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p> You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p> TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p> Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p> Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p> President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p> I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p> TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p> But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p> TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p> Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p> The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p> Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p> Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p> DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p> REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p> WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p> Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America fail than thrive. But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street. But hey we're in the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session. We had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan. Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p>The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p>We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp. Plus, the classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo becomes public.</p><p>But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit. He is here and he is going to explain why. We need to let the American public decide for themselves. That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America First speech. Hi, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN: Yes. Well, he is always America First, Trish and this was no different. He spoke to the Republicans gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p>But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear according to the President that Democrats want to do that. He cited the fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who have come to the United States illegally. And he says the Democrats that he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point. Here is what he said specifically about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They talk a good game with DACA but they don't produce. And so either they come on board, or we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion legislation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p>There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is no longer taxed to the federal level. So that's just part of the message. But then, he went on the attack against <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi, </nameText></person>the Minority Leader in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p>Here is the President in his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>called crumbs. That was a bad -- that could be like deplorable? Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs? Those two words they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: And so the President is now on his way back to Washington. Trish?</p><p>REGAN: All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp. Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: You know, he laid out an agenda. He did so in the State of the Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it. But it doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on this. So how are you going to get past that?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving --</p><p>REGAN: Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp. We'll try and get her back momentarily. But as she was saying it's become increasing a political wedge issue. And that's one of the problems here because, you know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well, you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down because you know what? We're not going to have that wall and we're going to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the lottery program.</p><p>How does that make any sense? They want to send all these people out of the country when the President is willing to give a deal? I mean politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on this one.</p><p>Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p>Good to see you guys.</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: Ford, I'll start with you. And again, we're going to try and get Mercedes back with us. It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p>But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p>O'CONNELL: He is --</p><p>REGAN: And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to deport all of these individuals?</p><p>O'CONNELL: Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54 Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration. And essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree with the President's position.</p><p>He is trying to make a deal. Unfortunately, Democrats are going to continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands. It's really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely right. We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and infrastructure.</p><p>REGAN: Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing. What do you think it's going to happens in '18?</p><p>HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, first of all, let's talk about the economy for a second. The current tax bill that was put through Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two percent of all Americans. Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p>REGAN: You know it just happened.</p><p>KHAN: It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly. I mean, we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for the American people. It hasn't trickled down to anyone. It seems to me a trickle up.</p><p>REGAN: Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks. And by the way, starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks. So --</p><p>KHAN: Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p>REGAN: I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know --</p><p>KHAN: We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay cuts coming back into people's --</p><p>REGAN: I mean -- OK. Hang on Ford. I want to keep going, Hamza. I want to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p>KHAN: Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well. A Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in office for a whole year. On top of that, even though President Trump seems to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase. So I'm not really sure what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>--</p><p>REGAN: Can I stop you. And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a second. But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth right now is a result of President Obama? You think that the 26,000 on the Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p>KHAN: President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall Street and Main Street. So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p>REGAN: OK. And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy. And I can tell you for a fact that Janet Yellen did. Because when you print out much money you see a little bit of bump up in the stock market. But until you actually have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall economic growth. It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things really started to take off. And that rumor got built into the market. And that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL: Hamza, if you want to do --</p><p>REGAN: Hang on. Let Ford get in. Go ahead, Ford.</p><p>O'CONNELL: Hamza, if you want to do what <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>is doing and saying the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018. And to Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and small business confidence is through the roof. And the reason why that is, is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip. It was regulation that was stifling the American economy. And it's deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four. And frankly if you guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're going to hold the House --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KHAN: I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House. And on top of that --</p><p>O'CONNELL: No, they're not. Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p>KHAN: Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the Senate on top of that. And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as I recall from today.</p><p>On top of that, only two percent --</p><p>REGAN: So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end chain migration.</p><p>KHAN: Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain migration. We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part of the country. And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million people a few years ago, to be Americans. Therefore, why are we negotiating about their right to be in their own country? I'm just using your own words.</p><p>REGAN: Let's just stop you there. Because what you are saying because you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send them away? I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that one to your base?</p><p>KHAN: Let me do this, Trish. Do you think it's a good optic for the Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p>REGAN: Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p>KHAN: We have so many innocent people in this country --</p><p>REGAN: That is what it is. That is what it is. You want to make it look, as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the bogeyman.</p><p>O'CONNELL: That's exactly --</p><p>KHAN: Well, he is the bogeyman. There is no argument there.</p><p>O'CONNELL: No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p>KHAN: Yes, he is the bogeyman. He is going after people in our country simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN: All right, I got to wrap it up there. It is good to talk to you both. But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House. Thank you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they are almost deliberately doing this, right? Because they kind of like the optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that somehow big, bad, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going go knocking on everyone's door and send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets people. And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting out vote for the base.</p><p>SCHLAPP: The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction. They don't want the President to succeed. They are actually bitter because of his success. I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate. He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform. He is the one that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA recipients. At the same time he wants to protect Americans. And that means securing our border. That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p>I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs coming through. There are individuals who are coming to the United States, part of the MS-13 gang. I mean they are -- and guess what? Those MS-13 gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or African-American. So we have to insure that there is safety along our border.</p><p>And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's work together. I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats. Let's get to a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure the border. And it is where mainstream America is at. I mean --</p><p>REGAN: And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right, Mercedes. I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to 2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer, you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi, </nameText></person>I believe, here we go here is the whole list. Forgive me. Joe Biden, all saying we needed a fence. They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in 2006.</p><p>SCHLAPP: And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration? It was actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013. There were plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain migration, end the diversity visa lottery program. So there is a lot more bipartisan room to grow there. And I think the President is saying let's just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and really get this done. The question will become, are Democrats simply going to play politics. Are they will to be come up with a true solution that would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p>REGAN: I think he might be able to get it done, really. I mean, tax reform went through. And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the President. All Barack Obama. But that's what you're fighting?</p><p>SCHLAPP: It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on. But I can just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence, consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it is impactful. And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year. That is impactful.</p><p>And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out of touch she is with where every day Americans are. And it's incredibly unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the American people. He understands the need of these families and the fact that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their family. And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p>REGAN: Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170. Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thank you very much.</p><p>REGAN: All right, new developments everyone on the controversial surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the public. We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p>REGAN: All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department. Sources telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps. For more, let's go to our own Blake Burman, who is at the White House. Hi, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Trish. And the White House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this four-page memo. The President did not mention it or his decision at all just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans in West Virginia.</p><p>The President now on his way back here to the White House. And according to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo. It would then be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill. At which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it. And it is believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p>One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King, and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I don't want to oversell it. I agree with Trey Gowdy. I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of oversell things. But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to be out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce their memo. The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of Justice and the FBI.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I think the FBI is exactly right. This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular documents but broader classified information than that. That because of serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading impression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see. Trish.</p><p>REGAN: All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: I absolutely do. I actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p>So here is how it happens. The Republican staff members, not members of the committee have top secret security clearances. And they can see the raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration and first year of President Trump's administration. From that, the Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA authorities. There was spying that should not have occurred. And there was spying done for political purposes. Congressman Schiff and his team have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here. So not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are based.</p><p>REGAN: Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain other information. We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them? Who knew about the law being broken? Who looked the other way?</p><p>Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight months. They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and signed by the President. They released it the next day. Congress should have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to extend FISA.</p><p>REGAN: But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: We are.</p><p>REGAN: But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public. We want to read this document and be able to interpret them. But when the same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. I hear you. So with all of this in mind, what could this memo possibly tell us? I mean, in which should we be taking it with a grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass. I hope this is not been oversold. I mean, we've been -- we've been conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the top.</p><p>Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might, I don't know. What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave threat to freedom in America.</p><p>REGAN: It is. It is. And some careers will be ended. And maybe this is the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for. I mean if this is --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Could very well be. One of our competing networks reported a few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may resign if this is released. Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p>REGAN: But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It may very well be. I cannot remember. A person has been watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized the White House and got away with it. That is what we saw last night and again this morning.</p><p>REGAN: Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: My pressure.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you so much. It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: My pressure, Trish. Thank you.</p><p>REGAN: All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved into negative territory. Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's jobs report. A biggie. Everyone is going to be watching this. What happens to the unemployment rate? What happens, I want to know to wages? Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data. We're on it for you next.</p><p>REGAN: All right, everyone, let's check out these markets. You can see we moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still lower. It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report coming tomorrow. We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon, however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these days.</p><p>Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald. Keith, it has gotten a little volatile lately. And I think back to --</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS: It has.</p><p>REGAN: -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know, doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is actually a good thing, Trish. We forgotten, but this used to be normal not too many years ago. And second, you have to have buying and selling to move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph). And that's what we're getting now. Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates. They're readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p>REGAN: You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up. How much concern is that to you right now?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing. The Fed lost control a long time ago. So take that out of the equation. What more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular is the key. If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in. So unless we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p>REGAN: I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year chart on the 10-year right now. I'm going to see if the team can get that together for you.</p><p>But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year. Keith, there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation on this economy or more of expectation of inflation. The idea that, you know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: No, it doesn't. I mean, you know, this is central banks at work. They're pumping so much money into the system. And yet, we got all kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p>But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got to go somewhere. So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the financial markets. The markets really are not just yield, they're about risk. And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a return.</p><p>REGAN: But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: You know, I think it's going to be a good number. What I want to see is composition. I want to see wage rate increases. That's the key.</p><p>REGAN: It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of companies handing out raises. I think you might get it more so in next month's report. But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that tomorrow. Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p>Vice President <person><nameText>Mike Pence </nameText></person>blasting <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>for her let them eat cake attitude over tax reform. She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses \"crumbs.\" She is doubling down on this. I'm wondering it is just a little like the deplorables comment. Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf, not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000 bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country. We've got more Intel on this, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody. That <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>called crumbs. That was a bad. That could be like deplorable, does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs? Those two words, they seem to have a resemblance. I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000. That is not crumbs. That is a lot of money.</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE PENCE </nameText></person>(R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>predicted economic \"Armageddon.\" Remember that one? Well, that wasn't the worst of it. It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3 million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many cases. She actually described that as \"crumbs.\" So if you're going to say $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with the deplorable comment? You know, it's funny, we have a conference call every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to deplorables. I mean it that's kind of moment. I never understand why she would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad. It is a deplorable kind of moment. As though, the President was listening to our conference call there.</p><p>Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p>And Gina, I mean, I don't get it. It is so tone deaf to say that a thousand dollars is crumbs. Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in a pretty massive way. They clearly don't have very good advisors around them, shall we say.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: Well, let's say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon for the Democrat Party.</p><p>You know, their fund-raising is at record lows. And while the RNC, of course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State of the Union address by the President. And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can say she is sorry. Maybe she can repent. She could donate her crumbs to her church. Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such need. Who knows? For Nancy, this is her own little reality. This is not reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p>REGAN: But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p>You know, I just, I think they don't get it. I understand that they don't really like seeing the Dow at 26,000. They don't really like the lack of regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning today, right? Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p>LOUDON: Right. And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the entire American people. I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a doubling down that you mentioned, by <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>and rest of the Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the American economy go south and then celebrate that fact. That puts them in direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p>But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party. It is like they don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say, this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same implosions over and over again.</p><p>REGAN: Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder any way. It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a rising tide here of economic optimism. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort there in West Virginia.</p><p>Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President over immigration reform. Even calling him, what they just love to call him, a racist. But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very different tune. We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p>You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\" They wanted stronger borders. We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for it when he was in office. We're showing it to you next.</p><p>REGAN: All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's immigration proposal, some even calling it racist. But, I just want you to hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by what President Trump said just the other night. It is important to watch these together. Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All-Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p>TRUMP: For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.</p><p>Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: OK. Let's just get this straight, right? It is somehow OK for Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p>Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri. David, I don't get it. Because the party he represents?</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR: Look, Trish, I'm with you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in those parts. And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the DREAMers. In return we have to increase border security. That is what President Clinton said in 1995. That is what President Trump.</p><p>President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is a fair compromise. It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them. In return, let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall. That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind. The problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also don't support it.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all saying, yes, Fence Act. It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of 2006.\"</p><p>I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated by this, David. What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here. That, you know, you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is proposing it.</p><p>TAFURI: Look, nobody should be against securing our borders. And if that requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to support that. In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to citizenship.</p><p>REGAN: He has offered that. But here is the problem. These are the other sticking points. And by the way I just point out interesting little fact for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that the Democrats have come up with. And the President's wall is $25 billion, so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p>But David, it's not just having border issues at stake. It's also the matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited our country. I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers, we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p>TAFURI: Trish, you're right. Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and including the lottery visas.</p><p>Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas. On the chain migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>TAFURI: In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration for the DACA, DREAMers participants. But I think the problem is, the proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants. So let's say you're an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you can't bring your parents.</p><p>REGAN: I'm coming up against a break. Not to break you up, David but I'm coming up against the break. I do appreciate that it sound like there is a little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a former member of the Obama administration. Thank you so much, good to see you.</p><p>The Democrats putting out Congressman <person><nameText>Joe Kennedy III </nameText></person>to give the party's official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very famous last name which harkens back to the past? Is this all they got? Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p>REGAN: All right, well I'm sure you saw <person><nameText>Joe Kennedy III </nameText></person>giving the Democratic response to the State of the Union. Just ask him, do the Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy? Is that all they got?</p><p>Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p>Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this? I mean, look, you know, no offense against him. Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger than who they typically have. I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a Kennedy?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Well, I thought it was great. They need to do something. I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that <person><nameText>Joe Kennedy III </nameText></person>was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before. Boy, how the world has changed.</p><p>REGAN: Wow. You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very, very different.</p><p>WEAD: Yes, and when the <person><nameText>Joe Kennedy III </nameText></person>argued it's all for rich people, when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a rising tide raises all boats. So Kennedy defended himself and <person><nameText>Joe Kennedy III </nameText></person>in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform. He said that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p>REGAN: Right.</p><p>WEAD: And the Kennedy --</p><p>REGAN: And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal conservative?</p><p>WEAD: And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats need. They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it. So maybe the Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in 2016 were catholic. Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p>REGAN: You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were Irish like you were catholic. I mean, that was part of that generation. And I think that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has really gotten in there and stolen that thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats. So maybe they think a Kennedy can bring them back. I would recommend he get the right economic policies.</p><p>Doug, it's good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>WEAD: Good to see you, too. Thank you for having me.</p><p>REGAN: All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

President Donald Trump says he's battling the nation's social media companies in the name of free speech.\"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election,\" he tweeted on Wednesday. \"If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen!\"</p><p>The president has long made unsubstantiated claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives, and mulled executive action[3] to regulate the companies.But he took his biggest step towards cracking down on online forums this week after Twitter flagged and fact-checked two of his tweets that contained false information about mail-in voting.Twitter's incremental but unprecedented move prompted Trump to lash out against the company and threaten to \"strongly regulate\" or shut down online platforms.On Thursday, he signed an executive order[4] threatening penalties against social media companies over allegations of bias against conservatives.The order seeks to empower federal regulators to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives social media companies broad authority to moderate speech on their platforms.The move was clearly retaliation for Twitter's fact check and, Democrats argue[5], a distraction tactic as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the country.Shortly after signing the order declaring free speech \"the bedrock of American democracy,\" Trump told reporters[6] that if it were legal for him to unilaterally \"shut down\" Twitter, \"I would do it.\"But he declined to delete his own account \u2014 his most important and preferred way to communicate with the public \u2014 and instead emphasized how much power he has to drive traffic and revenue to the site. 'Not how the Constitution works' Legal experts say[7] Trump has scant authority to enforce the order, which would circumvent Congress and violate longstanding judicial precedent. But they are concerned the unprecedented move will scare companies away from even modest moderation of disinformation on their sites.Critics argue the president is attempting to weaponize the Federal Communications Commission and other arms of the federal government to police online speech he disagrees with \u2014 the very definition of a First Amendment violation.\"This is not how the Constitution works,\" Ashkhen Kazaryan, director of civil liberties at the libertarian think tank TechFreedom, told Business Insider[8] on Thursday. \"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump. It does not protect Trump from Twitter.\"First Amendment experts are concerned that Trump's attacks will scare social media giants into framing neutrality as bipartisanship, rather than applying a non-political standard to policing content on their sites.\"Bipartisan is not the same as neutral and I think the risk here is that the political parties are really duking out a political fight with the platforms as the site for a proxy war over what's basically a cultural clash,\" Hannah Bloch-Wehba, a law professor at Drexel University who specializes in civil liberties and cyber issues, told Business Insider.Trump's motivation for battling with social media giants over what he considers censorship likely has little to do with free speech.If the president cared about First Amendment protections online, he would stop violating Twitter users' free speech rights[9] by blocking them from his account \u2014 a move the Second Circuit Court of Appeals deemed unconstitutional last year.Instead, Trump appears to be waging a political war to pressure social media giants to give him full reign to spread his messages, regardless of how truthful they are.

President Donald Trump's former acting Director of National Intelligence on early Friday morning said that private companies which refuse to sell police departments the software and technology they want should face 'consequences,' which would include being barred from obtaining federal government contracts. Richard Grenell, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Germany for two years prior to his three-month stint as acting DNI from February to May, was referring to Microsoft's decision to join a growing list of tech companies that have pledged not to sell police departments facial recognition software until there are federal laws in place to regulate its use. 'They should now be barred from federal government contracts - there should be consequences for not selling technology to police departments,' Grenell wrote on Twitter, also tagging President Trump in the post.They should now be barred from federal government contracts - there should be consequences for not selling technology to police departments. @realDonaldTrump[1] </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /dsOVPVfufI[2] \u2014 Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) June 12, 2020[3]During a Washington Post Live event Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said[4] the company would not be selling the software to police until Congress enacted a national law 'grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology.' 'The bottom line for us is to protect the human rights of people as this technology is deployed,' Smith said, aligning the company with other tech giants such as IBM and Amazon, both of which have made similar pledges. The companies' positions are a clear reflection of public sentiment toward law enforcement in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police late last month which sparked protests and demonstrations against police brutality across the globe. The protests, some of which devolved into rioting and looting, also produced reams of footage showing police officers using brutal force to deal with peaceful protestors. In October, Microsoft was awarded[5] the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing contract with the U.S . Department of Defense, which is reportedly worth up to $10 billion, though Amazon is challenging the decision in court. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has long been against State use of facial recognition software as it would allow for suspicionless surveillance of the public[6], responded to Grenell, saying the technology would essentially allow the government unfettered access to citizens lives. 'This would create a world in which the government can track your every movement, know who you are, where you've been, and even try to predict where you're going next. It would be the end of privacy as we know it,' the organization wrote.This would create a world in which the government can track your every movement, know who you are, where you've been, and even try to predict where you're going next. It would be the end of privacy as we know it. \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) June 12, 2020[7]Conservative attorneyGabriel Malor was similarly critical of Grenell, pointing out the logistical and ideological inconsistencies with his position.(1) The fed. gov't runs on Microsoft products, you're not gonna retrain people on like Linux or whatev.  (2) Once upon a time conservatives championed the right of business owners to decline service if it violated their conscience rights.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who plans to attend the summit, has commented that he is 'concerned there are people who work at the major technology platforms who want to put their thumb on the scale.''All we want is a fair fight,' said Gaetz. </p><p>'I guess in a sense if highlighting experiences and instances of bias will result in fewer moderations that present as bias, all the better.'Google leaks have revealed employees categorizing conservative leaders like Jewish conservative pundit Ben Shapiro[1] as 'Nazis.' As of July 10 it was revealed[2] that over 1000 Google employees signed a petition to target Breitbart news as 'prohibited content.'James O'Keefe of Project Veritas recently published a video[3] showing a high-ranking Google executive Jen Gennai talking about their ambitions to use their platform to meddle in the upcoming election and 'prevent next Trump situation.' YouTube, owned by Google, censored their video. Gennai has later tried to say her statements, even in the full unedited footage, were taken out of context, though what context they could have been in that would have made them at all appropriate is unclear.A recent poll conducted by McLaughlin and Associates, analyzed conservatives' attitude towards Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. According to the data, 76.7 percent of conservatives surveyed do not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally.38.8 percent agreed that they would like to see Facebook, Google, and Amazon both regulated and split into smaller companies. Conservatives specifically were concerned that Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter had too much control over their users. 48.3 percent of them specifically noted that Big Tech had 'too much control over what information people see.'As the Journal observed from another poll, Americans on both sides are uneasy with how powerful Big Tech companies have become. In a March Wall Street Journal/NBC survey of 1,000 Americans, '54% said they weren't satisfied with federal government regulation and oversight of social-media companies.'According to The Wall Street Journal,[4] attendees will include high profile free speech advocates like the Media Research Center's Brent Bozell, Prager U, the Claremont Institute, and more.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who plans to attend the summit, has commented that he is 'concerned there are people who work at the major technology platforms who want to put their thumb on the scale.''All we want is a fair fight,' said Gaetz. </p><p>'I guess in a sense if highlighting experiences and instances of bias will result in fewer moderations that present as bias, all the better.'Google leaks have revealed employees categorizing conservative leaders like Jewish conservative pundit Ben Shapiro[1] as 'Nazis.' As of July 10 it was revealed[2] that over 1000 Google employees signed a petition to target Breitbart news as 'prohibited content.'James O'Keefe of Project Veritas recently published a video[3] showing a high-ranking Google executive Jen Gennai talking about their ambitions to use their platform to meddle in the upcoming election and 'prevent next Trump situation.' YouTube, owned by Google, censored their video. Gennai has later tried to say her statements, even in the full unedited footage, were taken out of context, though what context they could have been in that would have made them at all appropriate is unclear.A recent poll conducted by McLaughlin and Associates, analyzed conservatives' attitude towards Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. According to the data, 76.7 percent of conservatives surveyed do not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally.38.8 percent agreed that they would like to see Facebook, Google, and Amazon both regulated and split into smaller companies. Conservatives specifically were concerned that Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter had too much control over their users. 48.3 percent of them specifically noted that Big Tech had 'too much control over what information people see.'As the Journal observed from another poll, Americans on both sides are uneasy with how powerful Big Tech companies have become. In a March Wall Street Journal/NBC survey of 1,000 Americans, '54% said they weren't satisfied with federal government regulation and oversight of social-media companies.'According to The Wall Street Journal,[4] attendees will include high profile free speech advocates like the Media Research Center's Brent Bozell, Prager U, the Claremont Institute, and more.

The company said the president had glorified violence, in violation of its policies, by decrying protesters in Minneapolis as \"THUGS\" and saying that looting would lead to \"shooting.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter hid Trump's tweet from public view, appending a label to it that also prevented it from being easily shared - a punishment the company meted out a second time hours later when the White House sent the same comment from its official account. The move left Trump and his allies seething, promising to penalize Twitter and its social media peers over unproven claims about censorship.</p><p>\"They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,\" Trump charged in a tweet Friday morning.</p><p>The actions of Trump and his top allies in recent days have troubled free-speech advocates, current and former federal regulators and the very social media companies on which the president has come to rely. Trump had never targeted the tech industry in this way before, despite years of verbal lashings, so critics saw in Trump's behavior a new attempt to use the Oval Office as a means to exact political revenge, with potentially costly consequences.</p><p>\"It is one thing for political candidates to be making aggressive statements toward tech companies and the media,\" said Adrian Shahbaz, the director of technology and democracy at Freedom House, a human rights watchdog that tracks press freedom. \"It's another thing for people in power to be making those same threats.\"</p><p>Shahbaz fretted that Trump might be \"using whatever means possible to coerce companies and manipulate speech for electoral gain,\" adding, \"The words of the president matter.\"</p><p>The White House declined to comment. The Trump campaign pointed to previous comments accusing the industry of improperly setting itself up as the \"arbiters of truth.\"</p><p>The emerging standoff between Trump and the tech industry reflects years of tension dating to the days before he won the presidency, when many executives and engineers in the liberal-leaning San Francisco Bay area actively campaigned against him. The relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington never fully thawed, and Trump has continued to harbor an intense, public skepticism of some of the very social media sites that were widely seen as critical to his 2016 victory.</p><p>The president's attacks hinge on allegations that Twitter and other tech companies suppress conservatives, systematically limiting their reach online. Such views are shared widely among Republicans, including on Capitol Hill, even as Internet giants insist on their political neutrality.</p><p>\"The big tech billionaires are so drunk with power that they are now willing to try to censor and silence the president of the United States,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has held multiple hearings on the issue, said Friday. \"Big tech's claim there are no clear empirical data demonstrating bias is reminiscent of the child who kills his parents and then pleads mercy of the court because he's an orphan.\"</p><p>A YouGov poll in July similarly found widespread belief in claims of political bias, with nearly half of all Americans saying they were somewhat or very likely to be true. Among GOP voters, 3 out of 4 said they were somewhat or very likely to be correct.</p><p>The attacks have put tech companies, including Twitter, into a political vise, trapped amid competing obligations to police a wide array of abusive content on the Internet while at the same time satisfying politicians who question their motives and decisions - all in the midst of a high-stakes election year.</p><p>\"The companies have become more willing to change the rules based on political pushback,\" said Alex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer and now head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies disinformation. \"It's been happening for years. It's just that Trump has gone well beyond where others were willing to go.\"</p><p>Trump long has threatened to penalize Silicon Valley over allegations of bias, even at one point holding a summit at the White House to explore claims of censorship. But he formalized his threats after Twitter took the rare step to label two of Trump's tweets about the 2020 election and redirect users to fact-checking resources.</p><p>An executive order the president signed Thursday directed federal agencies to consider rethinking a critical portion of law, known as Section 230, that spares tech companies from being held liable for the content posted by their users. If federal agencies carry that out as Trump intends, probing and penalizing social media sites for their practices, the order could affect every app, website and digital service people use to congregate online.</p><p>\"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States,\" Trump said as he signed the directive.</p><p>The prospect for wide-ranging consequences imperiling free speech on the Web quickly united a rare crop of critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, conservative groups funded by the Koch family, Democratic lawmakers and major technology companies. It raised significant legal questions, said Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Its issuance alone amounted to a form of \"cold coercion,\" Wheeler said. \"It is to create consequences for editorial decisions in which he doesn't agree.\"</p><p>Twitter for years had resisted such pressure to discipline the president for comments seen as toxic or false, believing users should have an unfettered view into their leaders' thoughts. On Friday, the company adopted a more aggressive approach to another Trump tweet, focused on the unrest in Minneapolis. While Twitter decided to limit the reach of that tweet, Facebook, in contrast, did not take action against the president's remarks.

The company said the president had glorified violence, in violation of its policies, by decrying protesters in Minneapolis as \"THUGS\" and saying that looting would lead to \"shooting.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter hid Trump's tweet from public view, appending a label to it that also prevented it from being easily shared - a punishment the company meted out a second time hours later when the White House sent the same comment from its official account. The move left Trump and his allies seething, promising to penalize Twitter and its social media peers over unproven claims about censorship.</p><p>\"They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,\" Trump charged in a tweet Friday morning.</p><p>The actions of Trump and his top allies in recent days have troubled free-speech advocates, current and former federal regulators and the very social media companies on which the president has come to rely. Trump had never targeted the tech industry in this way before, despite years of verbal lashings, so critics saw in Trump's behavior a new attempt to use the Oval Office as a means to exact political revenge, with potentially costly consequences.</p><p>\"It is one thing for political candidates to be making aggressive statements toward tech companies and the media,\" said Adrian Shahbaz, the director of technology and democracy at Freedom House, a human rights watchdog that tracks press freedom. \"It's another thing for people in power to be making those same threats.\"</p><p>Shahbaz fretted that Trump might be \"using whatever means possible to coerce companies and manipulate speech for electoral gain,\" adding, \"The words of the president matter.\"</p><p>The White House declined to comment. The Trump campaign pointed to previous comments accusing the industry of improperly setting itself up as the \"arbiters of truth.\"</p><p>The emerging standoff between Trump and the tech industry reflects years of tension dating to the days before he won the presidency, when many executives and engineers in the liberal-leaning San Francisco Bay area actively campaigned against him. The relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington never fully thawed, and Trump has continued to harbor an intense, public skepticism of some of the very social media sites that were widely seen as critical to his 2016 victory.</p><p>The president's attacks hinge on allegations that Twitter and other tech companies suppress conservatives, systematically limiting their reach online. Such views are shared widely among Republicans, including on Capitol Hill, even as Internet giants insist on their political neutrality.</p><p>\"The big tech billionaires are so drunk with power that they are now willing to try to censor and silence the president of the United States,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has held multiple hearings on the issue, said Friday. \"Big tech's claim there are no clear empirical data demonstrating bias is reminiscent of the child who kills his parents and then pleads mercy of the court because he's an orphan.\"</p><p>A YouGov poll in July similarly found widespread belief in claims of political bias, with nearly half of all Americans saying they were somewhat or very likely to be true. Among GOP voters, 3 out of 4 said they were somewhat or very likely to be correct.</p><p>The attacks have put tech companies, including Twitter, into a political vise, trapped amid competing obligations to police a wide array of abusive content on the Internet while at the same time satisfying politicians who question their motives and decisions - all in the midst of a high-stakes election year.</p><p>\"The companies have become more willing to change the rules based on political pushback,\" said Alex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer and now head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies disinformation. \"It's been happening for years. It's just that Trump has gone well beyond where others were willing to go.\"</p><p>Trump long has threatened to penalize Silicon Valley over allegations of bias, even at one point holding a summit at the White House to explore claims of censorship. But he formalized his threats after Twitter took the rare step to label two of Trump's tweets about the 2020 election and redirect users to fact-checking resources.</p><p>An executive order the president signed Thursday directed federal agencies to consider rethinking a critical portion of law, known as Section 230, that spares tech companies from being held liable for the content posted by their users. If federal agencies carry that out as Trump intends, probing and penalizing social media sites for their practices, the order could affect every app, website and digital service people use to congregate online.</p><p>\"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States,\" Trump said as he signed the directive.</p><p>The prospect for wide-ranging consequences imperiling free speech on the Web quickly united a rare crop of critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, conservative groups funded by the Koch family, Democratic lawmakers and major technology companies. It raised significant legal questions, said Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Its issuance alone amounted to a form of \"cold coercion,\" Wheeler said. \"It is to create consequences for editorial decisions in which he doesn't agree.\"</p><p>Twitter for years had resisted such pressure to discipline the president for comments seen as toxic or false, believing users should have an unfettered view into their leaders' thoughts. On Friday, the company adopted a more aggressive approach to another Trump tweet, focused on the unrest in Minneapolis. While Twitter decided to limit the reach of that tweet, Facebook, in contrast, did not take action against the president's remarks. The company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, posted online that he had a \"visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric\" - but he said it did not break the social networking site's rules.</p><p>\"I know many people are upset that we've left the president's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,\" he said.</p><p>In blasting the tech companies, Trump exploited the vulnerabilities of an industry whose products and services remain widely popular. The industry's legacy of missteps - including disinformation that spread virally online during the 2016 election and major privacy mishaps - have contributed to an erosion of its overall public support.</p><p>A Pew Research Center poll in July found that the percentage of Americans who view tech as having an overall positive impact had fallen sharply since 2015, down from 71 percent to 54 percent. Among Republicans, the number fell to 44 percent.</p><p>Daniel Kriess, an associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, viewed Trump's actions through the prism of the 2020 presidential race. \"This is the president deliberately picking a fight with Silicon Valley tech companies because he stands to gain electorally,\" he said. \"Particularly for his base, this is a very easy foil for President Trump.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-9c55a614-f95e-4fe4-a0f0-225f0b05c650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601G-MSV1-DXXY-303X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 31, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company said the president had glorified violence, in violation of its policies, by decrying protesters in Minneapolis as \"THUGS\" and saying that looting would lead to \"shooting.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter hid Trump's tweet from public view, appending a label to it that also prevented it from being easily shared - a punishment the company meted out a second time hours later when the White House sent the same comment from its official account. The move left Trump and his allies seething, promising to penalize Twitter and its social media peers over unproven claims about censorship.</p><p>\"They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,\" Trump charged in a tweet Friday morning.</p><p>The actions of Trump and his top allies in recent days have troubled free-speech advocates, current and former federal regulators and the very social media companies on which the president has come to rely. Trump had never targeted the tech industry in this way before, despite years of verbal lashings, so critics saw in Trump's behavior a new attempt to use the Oval Office as a means to exact political revenge, with potentially costly consequences.</p><p>\"It is one thing for political candidates to be making aggressive statements toward tech companies and the media,\" said Adrian Shahbaz, the director of technology and democracy at Freedom House, a human rights watchdog that tracks press freedom. \"It's another thing for people in power to be making those same threats.\"</p><p>Shahbaz fretted that Trump might be \"using whatever means possible to coerce companies and manipulate speech for electoral gain,\" adding, \"The words of the president matter.\"</p><p>The White House declined to comment. The Trump campaign pointed to previous comments accusing the industry of improperly setting itself up as the \"arbiters of truth.\"</p><p>The emerging standoff between Trump and the tech industry reflects years of tension dating to the days before he won the presidency, when many executives and engineers in the liberal-leaning San Francisco Bay area actively campaigned against him. The relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington never fully thawed, and Trump has continued to harbor an intense, public skepticism of some of the very social media sites that were widely seen as critical to his 2016 victory.</p><p>The president's attacks hinge on allegations that Twitter and other tech companies suppress conservatives, systematically limiting their reach online. Such views are shared widely among Republicans, including on Capitol Hill, even as Internet giants insist on their political neutrality.</p><p>\"The big tech billionaires are so drunk with power that they are now willing to try to censor and silence the president of the United States,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has held multiple hearings on the issue, said Friday. \"Big tech's claim there are no clear empirical data demonstrating bias is reminiscent of the child who kills his parents and then pleads mercy of the court because he's an orphan.\"</p><p>A YouGov poll in July similarly found widespread belief in claims of political bias, with nearly half of all Americans saying they were somewhat or very likely to be true. Among GOP voters, 3 out of 4 said they were somewhat or very likely to be correct.</p><p>The attacks have put tech companies, including Twitter, into a political vise, trapped amid competing obligations to police a wide array of abusive content on the Internet while at the same time satisfying politicians who question their motives and decisions - all in the midst of a high-stakes election year.</p><p>\"The companies have become more willing to change the rules based on political pushback,\" said Alex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer and now head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies disinformation. \"It's been happening for years. It's just that Trump has gone well beyond where others were willing to go.\"</p><p>Trump long has threatened to penalize Silicon Valley over allegations of bias, even at one point holding a summit at the White House to explore claims of censorship. But he formalized his threats after Twitter took the rare step to label two of Trump's tweets about the 2020 election and redirect users to fact-checking resources.</p><p>An executive order the president signed Thursday directed federal agencies to consider rethinking a critical portion of law, known as Section 230, that spares tech companies from being held liable for the content posted by their users. If federal agencies carry that out as Trump intends, probing and penalizing social media sites for their practices, the order could affect every app, website and digital service people use to congregate online.</p><p>\"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States,\" Trump said as he signed the directive.</p><p>The prospect for wide-ranging consequences imperiling free speech on the Web quickly united a rare crop of critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, conservative groups funded by the Koch family, Democratic lawmakers and major technology companies. It raised significant legal questions, said Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Its issuance alone amounted to a form of \"cold coercion,\" Wheeler said. \"It is to create consequences for editorial decisions in which he doesn't agree.\"</p><p>Twitter for years had resisted such pressure to discipline the president for comments seen as toxic or false, believing users should have an unfettered view into their leaders' thoughts. On Friday, the company adopted a more aggressive approach to another Trump tweet, focused on the unrest in Minneapolis. While Twitter decided to limit the reach of that tweet, Facebook, in contrast, did not take action against the president's remarks. The company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, posted online that he had a \"visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric\" - but he said it did not break the social networking site's rules.</p><p>\"I know many people are upset that we've left the president's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,\" he said.</p><p>In blasting the tech companies, Trump exploited the vulnerabilities of an industry whose products and services remain widely popular. The industry's legacy of missteps - including disinformation that spread virally online during the 2016 election and major privacy mishaps - have contributed to an erosion of its overall public support.</p><p>A Pew Research Center poll in July found that the percentage of Americans who view tech as having an overall positive impact had fallen sharply since 2015, down from 71 percent to 54 percent. Among Republicans, the number fell to 44 percent.</p><p>Daniel Kriess, an associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, viewed Trump's actions through the prism of the 2020 presidential race. \"This is the president deliberately picking a fight with Silicon Valley tech companies because he stands to gain electorally,\" he said. \"Particularly for his base, this is a very easy foil for President Trump.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-9c55a614f95e4fe4a0f0225f0b05c650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6017-17N1-JB4M-V0PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1316\"/><timeReceived>10:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\", and even suggested US regulators should sue them on the grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>The firms are already under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and Congress, following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign, and a bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation that has emerged in Congress.</p><p>Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations against Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages yesterday had familiar targets - \"certain companies\", the media and his Democratic rivals - that have resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the media and social media platforms, if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true stable genius\".</p><p>A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practised by certain companies\", Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he added.</p><p>Accusations commonly levelled by conservatives against social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters opposing abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and the Susan B Anthony List, say Twitter has blocked their ads.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top  stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Earnings driving the action on Wall Street,  three Dow components reporting today and mixed picture so far but Apple is  the number one in focus.  That tech giant's results after closing bell  today.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the tech wreck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key stocks entering correction territory, down 10 percent or more from  their recent highs.  Checking the market action this morning, we have a 30- point gain on Dow futures, green across the board on the Dow, S&amp;P, and  NASDAQ 100.  This after a different story yesterday, declines across the  board with the NASDAQ composite being the hardest hit despite.  But recent  weakness all of the major market gages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Including the Dow transports and the Russell 2000 are on track for monthly  gains as we wrap up July today.  In Europe we've had some mixed markets  right now, the DAX of the three major markets there is in negative  territory, ever so slightly.  And reading on the Eurozone economy showing  slowing growth in the second quarter.  In Asia overnight, markets heading  higher across the board.  The only loser there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Bank of Japan surprising investors by keeping its monetary policy  unchanged.  Protecting our border.  President Trump doubling down on his  calls for a government shutdown if funding is not approved. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One new development according to the Wall Street Journal, a  change in the timeline?  The President reportedly putting a shutdown on  hold until after the midterm elections.  We will hear from Homeland  Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus cybersecurity later this  hour.  And President Trump is speaking tonight in Tampa.  What will he say  then?  You have to watch Fox Business to find out.</p><p>Not taking the bait.  Kim Kardashian appearing on Jimmy Kimmel last night  where she was asked about her Oval Office visit.  What she said about the  Commander-in-Chief coming up.  The warning about drinking and shopping.   You won't believe how much people are spending online after throwing back a  few.  Whiskey drinkers are the most frugal.  We'll tell you what type of  drinkers are the biggest spenders.</p><p>We have Kat Timpf here to weigh in on that.  And so much more this morning.   She's a Fox News Contributor, Wall Street Journal Economics Editor Jon  Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.   Nothing wrong with that though because you know what, online, you can  return almost anything.  </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, absolutely.  Except I never do  because it's too complicated.  You got to put it back in the package, you  got walk downstairs, well, tick the elevator but still you got to wait for  elevator rather than stay on couch.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We weigh in.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  To hear how bourbon  drinkers fair in this whole --</p><p>TIMPF:  I'm a tequila drinker myself, so --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Tequila will get you into trouble.  Just saying.  So many  ways.  But first, two more Dow companies out with earnings this morning.   All eyes will be on Apple, that company reports after the will be.  Nicole  Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Hey, Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, guys.   All right.  Note to self.  No drinking and shopping.  Looking at the  earnings overall.  So, so far we're beating for estimates overall, tech in  particular is worrisome.  But let's take a look at these Dow components.   So Pfizer, this is to the downside this morning.  They beat on profit, they  did well with the pneumonia vaccine or arthritis drug.</p><p>But the truth to the matter is that they lowered the revenue expectation  for 2018, that is down .3 percent.  Procter &amp; Gamble also to the downside.   Quarterly sales were below the estimates.  This is Gillette Razors.  This  whole grooming unit was a miss, and so that's also lowered, got to get to  tech.  When we talk about the FAANG index which I watch regularly here on  the big board.</p><p>I talked to the traders, I talked to people who were managing money, they  all seem to say how important is Apple is after the bell.  Not only are we  to hear about the products, and what's going on in China, we're hearing  about strengthening dollar.  All of these things have factored in but tech  in particular has been selling off without any -- they're just selling it  all.  And so, if they sell off Apple, does that mean it breaks the trend  lines.</p><p>Because I talked to technical analysts too, watching the upwards trend line  of tech.  And now forget it.  This will be the last chance to hold on to  tech, that's what they're saying.  So they've made this very, very severe  for today's afternoon numbers.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  Lindsey Bell, really quickly on  this.  To point this out, we talk about this 10 percent correction in this  FAANG index, this is the second time it happened this year.  And also it  last happened three years ago.  So again, you want to talk about stocks  that have been able to recover from these past he sell-offs in recent years  worth noting.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Exactly.  And you've seen --  like I said earlier, some of the stocks in this index have done really  well, Alphabet which is Google, Amazon, other stocks like Microsoft, AMD  like the -- there are names that are doing really well that I think can  lift this up.  It seems to be a social media issue more than an overall  tech issue.  And we saw what Amazon reported result, that stock went up,  lifted the group up.</p><p>We'll see if Apple can do same.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great.  Switching gears.  President Trump heading to Florida  later today where he is expected to tout strong economic growth at a  workforce event and a Make America Great Again rally.  Blake Burman joins  us live from the White House with more details.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  President Trump reiterating yesterday here at the White  House that he is willing to meet with just about anybody.  We've already  seen the President meet with leaders of North Korea, the President of  Russia as well.  And President Trump saying yesterday that he is also  willing to meet with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't do that from strength or from weakness.  I think it's an  appropriate thing to do.  If we could work something out that's meaningful,  not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be  willing to meet. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you have preconditions for that meeting?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No preconditions, no.  They want to meet, I'll meet anytime they  want.  Anytime they want.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did appear to lay out  some conditions in an interview yesterday saying that Iran needs to make it  known that it's worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement, change their  behavior in the Middle East and change how they treat their own people.  A  spokesperson for the National Security Council backed that up in a  statement saying that the U.S. would be willing to reestablish diplomatic  relations with Iran.</p><p>And could pull back sanctions but also warned the following, \"this relief  is only possible if there are tangible demonstrated and sustained shifts in  Tehran's policies until then the sting of sanctions will only grow more  painful if the regime does not change course.  The head of Iran Strategic  Council responding this morning by the way saying that Iran does not see  any value in the President's offer to sit down for negotiations.</p><p>Meantime, as well in the world stage today, Dagen, a U.S. official  knowledge of the intelligence assessment tells Fox this morning that the  latest assessment does show that North Korea is continuing to build its  missile capabilities up and that includes ICBM, the intercontinental  ballistic missiles.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman at the White House for us.  Here  now with reaction, Byron York, Washington Examiner Chief Political  Correspondent, Fox News Contributor.  Byron, we're less than 100 days away  from the midterm elections.  What are you listening for in tonight's rally  because there is so much on the President's plate each and every day.  And  when -- it seems like that his plate is full, he add something else.  </p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, if you talk Republican strategists  who were trying to help the Republican Party keep control of the House, you  know, they'll tell you they want him to talk about the economy, they want  him to talk a lot about the economy, they want to talk about how Democrats  want to get rid of ICE.  They want him to talk about immigration, they want  him to talk about the specter of Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House.</p><p>They want him to talk about all of that stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will he?  Because again --</p><p>YORK:  Well, among other things, yes.  I think -- I think he probably will  but go all over the place, but the -- a number of these strategists have  been kind of rattled by the last month.  They were pretty confident a month  ago if you talked to them but the whole border family separation thing  followed by the President's performance in Helsinki, really spooked some of  them.  </p><p>They've seen some of the President's numbers and key Congressional  districts go down with those independent voters they're trying to get.  So  they are worried about the amount of noise that comes out of the White  House at any given time but they really wish they could keep pushing  economy, ICE, Supreme Court, Nancy Pelosi, that kind of stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President tweeted moments ago speaking of adding something  else to the list of topics this morning.  Collusion is not a crime.  That  doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked Hillary and  the Democrats.  Your reaction to that?  I'm sure that the \"strategists\"  don't want him tweeting about that but good luck telling the President what  to do.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, actually, the President has been pretty effective when -- with  this.  If you go back to the hiring of Rudy Giuliani and the beginning of  Rudy Giuliani kind of being the face of the President's defense and Emmet  Flood being the inside player on the President's defense.  By the way, when  is the last time anybody's heard Emmet Flood come out and say anything?   Does not happen.  They clearly got kind of a two-track effort going on.</p><p>And I think if you look at the polls showing the number of people who have  confidence in Robert Mueller and his investigation that has been slowly  ticking downwards since the President did this.  My guess is the President  is doing this because he thinks it works. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because you changed -- you get all the Democrats if you  listen to any of these other networks, they literally talk about Russia  non-stop.  They don't talk about anything that truly matters to anybody who  is working hard and trying to support their family in this country.  All  they talk about is Russia and who is getting interviewed by Mueller who is  subpoenaed.</p><p>And it's forcing the Democrats, they almost -- the Trump supporters want  the Democrats to talk about impeachment because he's a loser.  </p><p>YORK:  They absolutely do.  And I mean go back to 2006, if you remember,  George, the Iraq War was in terrible shape, George W. Bush very unpopular.   A number of Democrats were saying if we win the control of the House in  2006, there is going to be impeachment.  And it really did not fly and  Nancy Pelosi who wanted to be speaker, she turned out she did, basically  came out and said impeachment is off the table.</p><p>Now, there are a lot more Democrats who say that if the party wins, they  want Donald Trump impeached, but it's not working out that well in polls of  the general electorate.  So I think you're going to see a conflict inside  the Democratic Party in August, September, and October about how much to  emphasis the whole Trump-Russia thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Byron, you recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on  the escalating fear that's approaching as the midterms this fall becoming  increasingly imminent.  You write this.  Perhaps the biggest underlying  question of the coming elections is the relationship between presidential  job approval and the House GOP's reelection chances.  It's often observed  that Trump is keeping the favor of his base supporters.</p><p>He is but Republican -- something you just mentioned Republican strategists  are watching his approval sink.  In some educated affluent Congressional  districts with lots of independent voters, the party needs to hold the  House.  I mean, how do you reconcile these two because we were talking to  Congressman Ron DeSantis who's running for the governor of Florida earlier. </p><p>And President Trump's endorsement of this man, completely shifted the  momentum away from his Republican opponent and he has a double-digit lead  in the polls in Florida right now for the upcoming primary.  </p><p>YORK:  Absolutely turned it around for Ron DeSantis.  That is of course a  statewide race and all of the Congressional races are in the Congressional  districts.  But the big question of the midterms and nobody knows the  answer, the big question is what effect will the President's job approval  rating have on the voting?  In the past, we have generally seen the  President below 50 percent job approval rating.</p><p>It's harder for his party to keep the House.  They tend to lose more seats  but people wonder is Trump something different.  You have to remember, his  Donald Trump's personal disapproval rating was near year 60 percent on  Election Day, 2016 when he was elected.  And the number of smart  Republicans are saying, you know, I just don't know exactly how that works. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say strategists, I have to chuckle, because, again,  President Trump won that election by being himself and doing what he wanted  to and he ignored I would say most strategists. </p><p>YORK:  Oh, absolutely.  The only thing here is Donald Trump is not on the  ballot, you might think that by listening to this campaign but he is not on  the ballot, so it's really unclear how the Trump effect will play out in  these midterms.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Byron York, always love seeing you, sir.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up.  Talk about a financial hangover.   The shocking new study that finds Americans spend more than $30 billion in  online shopping when they're drinking.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The president continues to tweet this morning.  He has written  this.  I am looking into 3D plastic guns being sold to the public already  spoke to the NRA doesn't seem to make much sense.  This comes after several  states are lining up to sue to stop these 3D plastic guns.  </p><p>Switching gears.  The housing market latest challenge finding young workers  to build homes.  Cheryl Casone has details on this story.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Dagen.  Good  morning.  Young people apparently don't want to work in construction, Wall  Street Journal reports the percentage of workers who are 24 years old or  younger has fallen in nearly the entire country since the last housing  boom.  That was back in 2005.  There is no single reason for the shortage.</p><p>But when economists in the industry says the problem is contributing to a  labor shortage, that results and fewer homes being built and rising prices  for buyers.  Shares of two home builders (INAUDIBLE) toll brothers are both  down sharply this year.  I mean, sharply look at that chart.</p><p>OK.  Well, in case you missed it.  Kim Kardashian-West defended President  Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night.  No matter how hard Kimmel tried to  get her to criticize the president.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIM KARDASHIAN-WEST, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY:  I walk in and I'm  like I look around and I'm kind of star struck from the Oval Office and the  first thing I say in our meeting, I say holy [bleep] we're in the [bleep]  Oval Office.  That's what I said.  That was the first thing I said and I  had to take a moment and be like, wait, we're really here.  I'm very  grateful and I'm very hopeful that more good things are going to come out  of our conversation.  </p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST:  Oh, do you have a list now of  people that you might ask him to release from prison?  </p><p>KARDASHIAN-WEST:  I do.  I've been working on it.</p><p>KIMMEL:  Is Melania on it?  I know that you're not necessarily a Trump  supporter, I know your husband Kenya seems to like him.</p><p>KARDASHIAN-WEST:  I always respect what other person thinks.  I have  nothing bad to say about the president.  </p><p>KIMMEL:  Right.  Because you still have people on the --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  She held her ground the whole interview, guys.  She met with  President back in may to discuss the release of Alice Johnson who is  serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug charge in Tennessee.  Johnson  sentence was commuted by the President in June and she was immediately  released from prison.</p><p>And then there is this.  A new study says that drunk Americans really enjoy  online shopping after knocking back a few.  Spending a total of $30 billion  online each year.  More importantly what they drink impacts how much they  spend.  While shopping on Amazon for instance, gin drinkers tend to spend  the most an average of more than $82.00.  Rum and vodka drinkers in second  and third place both spending 50 bucks.</p><p>Followed by those who drink white wine, red wine, tequila, beer and then  the last place, I don't know what this means. Folks, but whiskey drinkers  spend an average $39.00.  Are whiskey drinkers cheap?  I don't know.  Also  note, there is a surge of drunk shopping on Saturday morning around 2 a.m.   Shoes and lingerie, some of the more popular items that are bought of 1,000  people surveyed who reported purchasing an item off of Amazon.</p><p>While drinking, about 50 percent said yes, they later returned their  purchases.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>CASONE:  I will send it over to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Your reaction, Kat Timpf.  </p><p>TIMPF:  I mean, I'm a tequila drinker but I've definitely spent more than  40 bucks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  You tequila drinkers are like out getting in fights with  people (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just joking.</p><p>TIMPF:  You know, me and my bar fighting problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  No, no, no.  I was just kidding.</p><p>TIMPF:  Never been in a fight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But by the way, whiskey drinkers having grown up down south  bourbon drinkers having fun with friends, shooting pool, like socializing,  they're not home shopping.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Right.  Well, you know, --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like -- unlike people in New York City who were drinking gin and  tonics alone on a Saturday night.  </p><p>TIMPF:  We can't all be popular.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you are popular, Kat.  Around here you are.  Coming up.   We're taking America from hackers.  The Department of Homeland Security has  created a new cyberhub.  We'll speak with the Homeland Security secretary  about that ahead.  Plus, crude awakening.  Why one expert is predicting oil  prices could surge to $400 per barrel.  We didn't make that up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  B.P. reporting a surprising second quarter profit tripling it  $1.8 billion net gain.  This comes after the company announced a multitude  billion-dollar deal in the U.S.  Shale country here to discuss, PKVerleger  president and battle -- excuse, Brattle Group senior adviser, Philip  Verleger.  Philip, your thoughts on the state of the energy sector right  now and your protection for catastrophe?</p><p>PHILIP VERLEGER, SENIOR ADVISER, BRATTLE GROUP:  Catastrophe, yes.  Yes,  $400 is a -- is an extreme peak.  Look, I'm an economist.  B.P. has been  doing a really great job in reshaping itself since the Macondo accident.   And it's -- this is not surprising.  I mean, it's why I don't follow  company earnings.  The B.P. people have been working extraordinarily hard  to bring down costs and trying to bring the more production.</p><p>And it's -- B.P. is now leading among the super majors I think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>VERLEGER:  But -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead, Philip.  Finish your thought.  </p><p>VERLEGER:  Well, no, what I was going to say is -- I mean, it's -- and they  will do better for the next year, a year and half as crude prices rise.   You know, I don't see -- $400 is an extreme point and I used to it to make  a -- try to call people's attention to this obscure regulation that could  really upset the whole economy in 2000 -- you know, lead to a situation  where consumers were paying $6.00, $7.00 a gallon election day 2020.   Something nobody wants to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, just to explain that.  The International  Maritime Organization ruled that Phillip is talking about requires shippers  to use only low sulfur fuel which will shift five percent of global oil  demand away from high sulfur and toward low sulfur.  That's going to bring  oil prices to 2008 peaks by 2020.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, Philip, I'd like to hear your explanation, you  put the $400 a barrel oil price out there.  How do you get to that and how  does this one obscure regulation get you to that kind of extreme  prediction?  </p><p>VERLEGER:  What it does is, you know, I laid out in 2005 why we're going to  see a $100 oil.  And the -- and same reason.  It -- what it does is it put  an extreme demand for low sulfur diesel fuel onto the refining system and  they can't produce it.  So what we're going to see is roughly a million to  a million and a half barrel a day, global decline in the use of diesel fuel  across the industrial sector.  That's what's needed to make the fuel for  the maritime organization.</p><p>For the -- for the shippers.</p><p>BELL:  But Philip --</p><p>VERLEGER:  It's --</p><p>BELL:  Lindsey Bell, I just -- is there -- you're talking about the  refiners having to change, you know, the way they refine the oil.  What  about --there's another alternative of shifts putting equipment onto their  -- to the boat to really address the emission issue.  Is that a more  efficient way, is that a possible way of addressing this issue?</p><p>VERLEGER:  Yes, Lindsey.  That's absolutely a way.  You can't -- what you  have to do is put the ship and dry if off and you put the scrubber material  in there.  So you scrub the fuel the way you scrub on a power plant.  Six  percent, maybe seven percent of the world shipping capacity will have  scrubber by 2020.  There are 60,000 to 80,000 ships they think maybe,  6,000, 6500 ships will have scrubbers.</p><p>But that leaves a huge number of ships not and many of the large shipping  companies are saying that they're going to rely on the oil industry to  provide the low sulfur oil.  Maersk has made that statement I believe and  as the big Costco shipping company from China.  So most of the, you know,  most of the shipping companies keep saying, look, it is a refiner's  obligation to do this.  The refiners aren't prepared to make it yet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Philip, it's good to see you.  Please come back, sir, often.  </p><p>VERLEGER:  Yes.  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Philip Verleger.  More Trump tweets.  President Trump tweeting  again this.  We'll be in Tampa tonight.  A big year for Congressman  DeSantis who will be a great governor for Florida.  Strong on crime,  borders and our second amendment.  Big help on tax and regulation cuts.   Lovers our military and our vets.  Has my full and total endorsement.  Ron  DeSantis who we talked to last hour still has to go up against a  challenger.</p><p>The Secretary of Agriculture in the State of Florida.  That run -- that  primary in the Republican Party for the Republican nomination to run for  governor is in August.  However, President Trump's supporter Ron DeSantis  has really turned around things for DeSantis.  He as a double-digital lead  in the polls now.  Coming up.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  will join us.  She will weigh in on the department's security strategy,  immigration and much more.</p><p>Plus, a new warning for Morgan Stanley.  Why the firm is predicting the  biggest correction since February pointing to earnings misses from Facebook  and Netflix which are now in bear market territory, down more than 20  percent each from their recent highs.  We'll be right back.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL HOST:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report.  A special presentation for Fox Business.  I'm Dani  Klupenger.  Former number one Andy Murray made his return to the ATP World  Tour at the Citi Open Monday.  But the three-time major champion was far  from his bet.</p><p>Mackenzie McDonald took full advantage of a slow start from the Scott.   He's making his comeback after hip surgery.  The American closing out the  opener 6-3.  But  a slight struggling with his mobility.  Murray managed to  claw his lead back into the match, leveling it up after taking the second  6-4.  </p><p>Sheer determination got Murray across the finish line as he wraps up the  hard-fought win 7-5 deep in the decider.  But it doesn't get easier, up  next, countryman and top 20 star, Kyle Edmund.  And don't forget, Tennis  Channel's exclusive coverage of the city open from Washington D.C.  continues Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Three Dow  components among the big names reporting earnings today; Pfizer and Procter &amp; Gamble already out with their numbers, some mixed reports there.  But  this -- and you can see, Pfizer's stock down more than one percent.   Procter &amp; Gamble stock, this is premarket trading, down more than three  percent.  Again, it was a revenue miss for Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>We've got Apple reporting this afternoon, however, will Apple be able to  turn around the likes of Facebook and Twitter?  Talk about Facebook and  Netflix, those stocks as of yesterday in bear market territory, they are  down more than 20 percent from their recent highs.  We'll see if Apple can  buck that trend.</p><p>Futures are showing this right now, we've had gains across the board all  morning, reversing losses yesterday, 24-point gain on the Dow Futures.   Numbers on personal income and spending, come -- just hitting the wires,  both personal income and spending rising four-tenths of one percent, in  line with the economists' expectations.  The core PCE Index which is the  Fed's chosen indicator for inflation, rising 1.9 percent compared to a year  ago.  So, based on that inflation, looks pretty tame.</p><p>In Europe, we look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains in -- on  the FTSE 100 in England and the CAC Quarante in France, the DAX heading  lower, losing one-quarter of one percent.  The Asian markets mostly higher,  the Hang Seng the only loser there, down half of one percent.  </p><p>Are the bears knocking at the door?  Analysts at Morgan Stanley say stocks  could be in for the biggest correction since February.  We have details  coming up on that.  Plus, building the wall, President Trump speaking out  again yesterday on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Unlike President Obama, I just want great border security.  Our  countries have learned through hard experience that border security is  national security, they are one and the same.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President threatening a government shutdown over border  security funding but one administration official tells the Wall Street  Journal that the fight will happen after the midterm elections.  Roseanne  got the boot, Director James Gunn gets fired, one comedian says that we  should just take it easy and stop being so sensitive to everything.  You  cannot wait to hear from her.</p><p>And now, to the top story this half hour, protecting America, the  Department of Homeland Security hosting a cybersecurity summit today.   That's where we find Deirdre Bolton, she is live in New York City with the  Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.  Good morning, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   I certainly am.  And I pleased to welcome, of course, Secretary Nielsen.   Thank you so much for the time today.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  My  pleasure.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, you have this huge cybersecurity summit.  You are hosting it  today, you have the head of the FBI, you have the head of the NSA, you have  Vice President Mike Pence, and then you also have tons of business leaders,  CEOs from tech, and banking, and energy.  What is the biggest threat right  now to our infrastructure?</p><p>NIELSEN:  The biggest threat in my mind is if we don't partner.  So, what  we see the adversary is doing is they're crowdsourcing.  So, they're using  bots, they're using paid influencers, they're using their governments,  they're using anyone and everyone that can attack us.  So, the biggest  threat is if we don't work together to counter that.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, give me, if you don't mind, Secretary, in order of  aggressivity, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, unknown.  So, that's one  through five, who's attacking us the most?</p><p>NIELSEN:  OK.  So, it's a good question.  They all have slightly different  note.  So, I would say Russia is very active, they'll continue to be  active, we've seen meddling in the election, we've seen meddling with our  industrial control systems, we've seen meddling with routers.  China has  more of a long view, so they're looking more to understand our systems  particularly in government, understand who's who, get different access to  systems.  Iran we see very active and North Korea both but general in their  regions.  So, they have the capability, we know they have the intent but we  don't see them quite as active towards us.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, what's our response, what's our strategy?  You attack us, we  hit back 10 times as hard?  What can we do to take away an incentive to  keep trying to figure out our systems?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  I mean, I (INAUDIBLE) we do have to move from complacency  to consequences and I think you've seen that.  So, whether it's through  legal means such as indictments, whether it's through sanctions through the  Treasury Department, whether it's through diplomatic means such as P&amp;G, we  have to have consequences for the activities.  We have to call them out and  hold them responsible.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, you're creating a risk management center, and it goes back to  this point about coordination, where you really feel the government and  private enterprise needs to be coordinated because some business leaders  have complained, like, even when I think I'm hacked I don't know who to  call.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  Is this the answer, the risk management center.</p><p>NIELSEN:  (INAUDIBLE) never call 911.  We saw that happened before  (INAUDIBLE) communities.  No, I think it is.  So, how it is now, we have  different intel that comes in so we collate at the government level, all  the intel unclass and classified.  But we needed the private sector  perspective to understand the context to which to imply that intel.  So,  for example, working very closely with the energy sector, the finance  sector, and the com sector, if we have a piece of intel, we can see how it  fits in to their operational environment and how it could affect them.   That helps us prepare, helps them prepare, and helps us be ready for the  systemic threats.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, you mentioned energy, I've heard some people say, parts of our  system are so old that it's actually hard to hack, but then we've seen  evidence of Russia actually having a certain amount of success in breaching  some ports which normally shouldn't have been breached.  How do you see it?</p><p>NIELSEN:  They're trying, for sure.  I mean, I think they have some  capabilities that's seen in Ukraine, they sort of continue to scan and  attempt to access our systems in the U.S.  There was one limited  distribution asset that they did attack.  It would not have had effect on  the larger grid, but your point is valid.  So, working very closely with  the Department of Energy and Secretary Perry will be joining us today to  help give the perspective from the energy sector.</p><p>BOLTON:  Of all the systems that we have, whether it's banking or whether  it's internet security, or whether it's the energy grid, what are you most  worried about?  What keeps you up at night in this cyber context?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I'm just worried about being behind, right?  So, they continue to  innovate daily, sometimes by the minute in terms of their different ways  that they're attacking us.  So, we have to keep up.  They're crowdsourcing  their attacks that I mentioned earlier so we have to have that partnership.   But really, it's evolving threats.  So, I worry that at given times, we  might not have the authority and resources we need to combat them  effectively.  So, it's moving towards our toes.</p><p>BOLTON:  When you talk about resources, what is it like for you to recruit  because I'm thinking of computer scientists coming out of MIT would  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, that's who you need.  You need these code breakers, you  need these hackers.  It's easier for them to go and work in Silicon Valley.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, it is.  It's much more lucrative.  We're working on a  variety of different initiatives, everything from exchanging partners with  the private sector, so we have a loan executive program, but we also  actually are doing something that I think is quite innovative which is  working with GSA to develop a whole new GSA system to hire federal  employees, that's really based on their skill sets in cyber which might not  necessarily equate to the traditional educational requirements.</p><p>BOLTON:  Now, I know as we talked about it, you have CEOs here.  How  cooperative is private enterprise with the government.  There's a lot of  people who don't trust the government.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, it's taken the DHS about 15 years old, it's taken us  probably all 15 of those years to build up the trust.  When used to say  we're from the government, we're here to help, it wasn't really something  people wanted to hear, but I think what you'll hear from the CEOs today is  they're coming committed to this partnership, committed -- and that's the  full -- it's not just for smiles, it's not just when the attack happens but  it's on the planning, the risk assessment, the prioritization, really  understand that interdependent fabric between all the sectors.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  We know, for example, at the border, Microsoft specifically  saying we don't want our facial recognition technology used there.  What is  your opinion on that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I will see to Microsoft their thoughts on that, but sometimes the  biometric technology is actually fastest way to confirm an identity.  So,  we use facial recognition in limited ways right now within the air domain,  within aviation, and we find that vastly increases the ability of  (INAUDIBLE) of passengers.  So, if it's something we can do faster to make  it more efficient while still keeping it secured, at DHS, we'll always look  for opportunities.</p><p>BOLTON:  Secretary Nielsen, before we let you go, how do you see this idea  of a border wall fitting in with immigration policy and how that fits with  security and cybersecurity?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, all of this together, we're sort of talking about different  walls, aren't we?  So, on the border, walls work.  We've seen that in  (INAUDIBLE) we've seen that in San Diego, we've seen that in other  countries.  When the wall goes out, it does absolutely serve as not just a  deterrent but a physical barrier that makes it much more difficult to  access.  The same can be true of cyber, so what we're looking at is a  system of systems of approach, some are firewalls, but much more than that,  it's monitoring on the systems, looking at the network traffic, identifying  the threat indicator sharing, mitigation measures.  So, similar to  immigration, you have to have -- you have to have many, many layers of  security in order to assure ourselves we're protecting Americans.</p><p>BOLTON:  Do you think we're going to see a shutdown based on this issue?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I think the president has been clear as to what he believes is  needed for border security, but from my perspective, we'll continue to work  with the appropriators and work with Congress so I can make sure that the  men and women of DHS have what they need to do their jobs.</p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  Secretary Nielsen, thank you for the time.  We  appreciate it.  Enjoy the summit.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Thank you.  We will.  Great.</p><p>BOLTON:  Dagen, back to you and studio.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that interview and thanks to the  Secretary as well.  Coming up, a new warning from Morgan Stanley, why the  firm is predicting a correction.  And after Facebook and Netflix, they're  now in the bear market territory, down 20 percent as of yesterday.  And  Leslie Jones is speaking out about comedians being politically correct.   Stuart Varney is here to weigh in, and I can't wait, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LESLIE JONES, COMEDIAN:  Stop walking around, so offended.  You're not  going to be able to survive life if you walk around offended.  Laugh!   Laugh!  Laugh!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Comedians underfire.  That was \"Saturday Night Live!\" star  Leslie Jones.  She's amazing, love her.  Telling the ladies of \"The View\"  that everyone needs to just get a life, to paraphrase.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Hey, Stuart.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, look, I'm glad we  decided to highlight this because, you know, it's a part of life, isn't it?   You watch those late night comedians, they're awful, they don't make me  laugh, they are not funny.  I've just had a nice three-day weekend and I  took a little time to see some of these late night guys, useless!  I mean,  they're so negative, so hostile, it's all so political, so divisive, I  really welcome Leslie Jones' statement there, and she made it on of all  places, \"The View.\"  </p><p>She's saying, look, \"You can't go through life if you are offended by  everything, you got to laugh.\"  I think her message is, especially those  young people who watch the late night guys, you can't go through life like  this, you can't start out being opposed to everything and being sensitive  to the slightest slight, you can't do that.  I think her message is very  important, and I hope it's picked up by other comedians who make it -- who  bring back comedy, where you're watching their act and you laugh at it, you  laugh with them, you laugh at them, you laugh at the jokes, you smile.  If  we could get back to that, I'd be delighted, not that I will be watching  late night television any time soon again, but it would make a nice change  to our life, wouldn't it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Stuart, I will turn this back on itself, because part of  what she is saying is there are a lot of people who when those late night  comedians -- I agree, I haven't heard once anything funny in a long time  from them, but Trump supporters who listen to them, when they try to make a  joke about the President, or about Republicans, anything that anyone says,  that's meant to be a joke is offensive.  And so, in part, that's what  Leslie Jones is referring to.</p><p>VARNEY:  I agree.  Yes, that's what -- that's what she's also saying,  lighten up.  Come on, lighten up.  The job of a comedian is to make me  smile, it's to make me laugh, and that whole profession of comedians has  forgotten that message, and I think Leslie Jones is absolute right to bring  it back again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and she's also saying that people who go to these comedy  shows, who watch all of these -- the myriad Netflix specials by comediennes  and that a lot -- it's not just the comedians, it's the people watching  them.  They literally come to the table with a list of things that will  offend them, down to do not make fun of people who love cats.  I love cats,  I'm offended by you making fun of cat lovers.  It's that granular, and  that's why people are walking around, as my mother says, with a mad on all  of the time.</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.  Didn't have you have Jimmy Kimmel with Kim Kardashian,  trying to make her go after Mr. Trump or be snide in some ways towards him.   Well, that's just typical, isn't it?  Well, what are they thinking of?  I  mean, is that funny?  Is that what you want to do with your late night  spot?  I can't believe it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've made fun of Kim Kardashian a lot or criticized that family  a lot, however, I will say this, she held her ground with him.  She said,  I'm not going to say anything negative.  And you know what, she deserves a  lot of credit for that.</p><p>VARNEY:  Look, I think she deserves a lot of credit for making an enormous  amount of money without being really good at anything other than being  famous.  And that, to me, is remarkable feat.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- we'd take that job, too, I think, if we could get  it, just being -- making -- being rich for just being yourself.  I think  that we'll take that if we can do it, but we have to have other skills.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it wouldn't work with me, I'm afraid.  It just wouldn't work.   There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, nobody understands what I'm saying.  I'm out of time  anyways, so good luck with that.  Stuart, I love you dearly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  See you later.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He will be up in less than 10 minutes, every weekday 9:00 a.m.  to noon, Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Coming up, Morgan Stanley is  warning a correction is looming after earnings misses from Facebook and  Netflix.  We are breaking down the details, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors losing their taste for some key technology stocks,  Facebook and Netflix both yesterday, closing in bear market territory, down  more than 20 percent from their recent record highs, hit earlier this  month.  This comes as analysts at Morgan Stanley believe a major sell-off  is on the way for the broader markets.  Joining us now, S&amp;P Global Market  Intelligence portfolio manager Erin Gibbs.  What do you make of this, is it  going to be these tech stocks that lead the broader market lower?</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  I think  it's an overstatement to say that just a couple stocks that have been  missing, and yes, they have missed at extreme levels are going to draw all  of the entire market down.  When you look at the broader S&amp;P 500, we're  actually trading at really regional valuations.  We're looking at 22  percent growth, and when you look at the beat rates for just for a second  quarter and guidance, where the stocks are beating at about an 82 percent  rate, that's really high, that's like 10 percent higher than normal.  So,  the broader market actually looks pretty healthy and while technology has a  huge impact on it, I don't see it being able to take the entire market  down.  And the market is only up four percent year-to-date.  I don't see  that suddenly making, like, us wiping out all of the gains that we've  achieved this year.</p><p>TIMPF:  Well, I think that this report by Morgan Stanley is it's looking at  lagging indicators, it's looking at GDP, it's looking at earnings, so those  are lagging indicators.  If you look at leading indicators like the stock  market and manufacturing data, that's all been really strong.  Where do you  when you think about investing for the second half of the year, where are  you putting your money?</p><p>GIBBS:  So for us, we've been talking about the difference between the  value and growth stocks for a few weeks now, and when you look at the  return of growth stocks, they're up about 10 percent year-to-date and  values only up about two percent.  So, value has been the big laggard and  that's definitely -- if you want safety, that's the place that's not going  down because you just haven't seen this huge uptick, and that could be an  area perhaps later in the year.  I'd say it's a little earlier now, August  tends to be a bad month anyway, it tends to be a rough month, but I would  say in the fall, if -- particularly if we see any preference towards  financials, we really start seeing interest rates, the yield curve go  higher, that could be an area.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of interest rates, the Federal Reserve meets this week,  not expected to raise interest rates but, again, what will investors be  looking at?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, they're going to be looking at how the Fed  describes how the economy is doing, that really is what changes in their  statement that comes out tomorrow.  I mean, the Fed has going to have to be  positive on the economy.  You know, four percent growth in the second  quarter, inflation that's reaching its target.  You know, I think they're  going to be projecting at least one more interest rate increase and  probably too before the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then we got a big old jobs report out on Friday.  So,  190,000 jobs expected right now.  Erin Gibbs, thank you so much, great to  see you.  Next time, more time, promise.  We'll be right back, everybody.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf, Jon Hilsenrath, Lindsey Bell, come back one and all,  thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it does.  And good morning to you, Dagen.  And good morning,  everyone.  Apple reports today, it's the last of the big tech highflyers to  lay out the financial results.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 31st. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Earnings driving the action on Wall Street, three Dow components reporting today and mixed picture so far but Apple is the number one in focus. That tech giant's results after closing bell today. We have a preview plus a closer look at the tech wreck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key stocks entering correction territory, down 10 percent or more from their recent highs. Checking the market action this morning, we have a 30- point gain on Dow futures, green across the board on the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ 100. This after a different story yesterday, declines across the board with the NASDAQ composite being the hardest hit despite. But recent weakness all of the major market gages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Including the Dow transports and the Russell 2000 are on track for monthly gains as we wrap up July today. In Europe we've had some mixed markets right now, the DAX of the three major markets there is in negative territory, ever so slightly. And reading on the Eurozone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter. In Asia overnight, markets heading higher across the board. The only loser there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Bank of Japan surprising investors by keeping its monetary policy unchanged. Protecting our border. President Trump doubling down on his calls for a government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we don't get border security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would have no problem doing a shutdown. It's time we had proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: One new development according to the Wall Street Journal, a change in the timeline? The President reportedly putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm elections. We will hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus cybersecurity later this hour. And President Trump is speaking tonight in Tampa. What will he say then? You have to watch Fox Business to find out.</p><p>Not taking the bait. Kim Kardashian appearing on Jimmy Kimmel last night where she was asked about her Oval Office visit. What she said about the Commander-in-Chief coming up. The warning about drinking and shopping. You won't believe how much people are spending online after throwing back a few. Whiskey drinkers are the most frugal. We'll tell you what type of drinkers are the biggest spenders.</p><p>We have Kat Timpf here to weigh in on that. And so much more this morning. She's a Fox News Contributor, Wall Street Journal Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. Great to see you. Nothing wrong with that though because you know what, online, you can return almost anything.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, absolutely. Except I never do because it's too complicated. You got to put it back in the package, you got walk downstairs, well, tick the elevator but still you got to wait for elevator rather than stay on couch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We weigh in.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: To hear how bourbon drinkers fair in this whole --</p><p>TIMPF: I'm a tequila drinker myself, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Tequila will get you into trouble. Just saying. So many ways. But first, two more Dow companies out with earnings this morning. All eyes will be on Apple, that company reports after the will be. Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with the details. Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, guys. All right. Note to self. No drinking and shopping. Looking at the earnings overall. So, so far we're beating for estimates overall, tech in particular is worrisome. But let's take a look at these Dow components. So Pfizer, this is to the downside this morning. They beat on profit, they did well with the pneumonia vaccine or arthritis drug.</p><p>But the truth to the matter is that they lowered the revenue expectation for 2018, that is down .3 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble also to the downside. Quarterly sales were below the estimates. This is Gillette Razors. This whole grooming unit was a miss, and so that's also lowered, got to get to tech. When we talk about the FAANG index which I watch regularly here on the big board.</p><p>I talked to the traders, I talked to people who were managing money, they all seem to say how important is Apple is after the bell. Not only are we to hear about the products, and what's going on in China, we're hearing about strengthening dollar. All of these things have factored in but tech in particular has been selling off without any -- they're just selling it all. And so, if they sell off Apple, does that mean it breaks the trend lines.</p><p>Because I talked to technical analysts too, watching the upwards trend line of tech. And now forget it. This will be the last chance to hold on to tech, that's what they're saying. So they've made this very, very severe for today's afternoon numbers. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Nicole. Lindsey Bell, really quickly on this. To point this out, we talk about this 10 percent correction in this FAANG index, this is the second time it happened this year. And also it last happened three years ago. So again, you want to talk about stocks that have been able to recover from these past he sell-offs in recent years worth noting.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Exactly. And you've seen -- like I said earlier, some of the stocks in this index have done really well, Alphabet which is Google, Amazon, other stocks like Microsoft, AMD like the -- there are names that are doing really well that I think can lift this up. It seems to be a social media issue more than an overall tech issue. And we saw what Amazon reported result, that stock went up, lifted the group up.</p><p>We'll see if Apple can do same.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great. Switching gears. President Trump heading to Florida later today where he is expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event and a Make America Great Again rally. Blake Burman joins us live from the White House with more details. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Dagen. Good morning to you. President Trump reiterating yesterday here at the White House that he is willing to meet with just about anybody. We've already seen the President meet with leaders of North Korea, the President of Russia as well. And President Trump saying yesterday that he is also willing to meet with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I don't do that from strength or from weakness. I think it's an appropriate thing to do. If we could work something out that's meaningful, not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be willing to meet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have preconditions for that meeting?</p><p>TRUMP: No preconditions, no. They want to meet, I'll meet anytime they want. Anytime they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did appear to lay out some conditions in an interview yesterday saying that Iran needs to make it known that it's worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement, change their behavior in the Middle East and change how they treat their own people. A spokesperson for the National Security Council backed that up in a statement saying that the U.S. would be willing to reestablish diplomatic relations with Iran.</p><p>And could pull back sanctions but also warned the following, \"this relief is only possible if there are tangible demonstrated and sustained shifts in Tehran's policies until then the sting of sanctions will only grow more painful if the regime does not change course. The head of Iran Strategic Council responding this morning by the way saying that Iran does not see any value in the President's offer to sit down for negotiations.</p><p>Meantime, as well in the world stage today, Dagen, a U.S. official knowledge of the intelligence assessment tells Fox this morning that the latest assessment does show that North Korea is continuing to build its missile capabilities up and that includes ICBM, the intercontinental ballistic missiles. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Blake. Blake Burman at the White House for us. Here now with reaction, Byron York, Washington Examiner Chief Political Correspondent, Fox News Contributor. Byron, we're less than 100 days away from the midterm elections. What are you listening for in tonight's rally because there is so much on the President's plate each and every day. And when -- it seems like that his plate is full, he add something else.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, if you talk Republican strategists who were trying to help the Republican Party keep control of the House, you know, they'll tell you they want him to talk about the economy, they want him to talk a lot about the economy, they want to talk about how Democrats want to get rid of ICE. They want him to talk about immigration, they want him to talk about the specter of Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House.</p><p>They want him to talk about all of that stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Will he? Because again --</p><p>YORK: Well, among other things, yes. I think -- I think he probably will but go all over the place, but the -- a number of these strategists have been kind of rattled by the last month. They were pretty confident a month ago if you talked to them but the whole border family separation thing followed by the President's performance in Helsinki, really spooked some of them.</p><p>They've seen some of the President's numbers and key Congressional districts go down with those independent voters they're trying to get. So they are worried about the amount of noise that comes out of the White House at any given time but they really wish they could keep pushing economy, ICE, Supreme Court, Nancy Pelosi, that kind of stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President tweeted moments ago speaking of adding something else to the list of topics this morning. Collusion is not a crime. That doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked Hillary and the Democrats. Your reaction to that? I'm sure that the \"strategists\" don't want him tweeting about that but good luck telling the President what to do.</p><p>YORK: Well, actually, the President has been pretty effective when -- with this. If you go back to the hiring of Rudy Giuliani and the beginning of Rudy Giuliani kind of being the face of the President's defense and Emmet Flood being the inside player on the President's defense. By the way, when is the last time anybody's heard Emmet Flood come out and say anything? Does not happen. They clearly got kind of a two-track effort going on.</p><p>And I think if you look at the polls showing the number of people who have confidence in Robert Mueller and his investigation that has been slowly ticking downwards since the President did this. My guess is the President is doing this because he thinks it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Because you changed -- you get all the Democrats if you listen to any of these other networks, they literally talk about Russia non-stop. They don't talk about anything that truly matters to anybody who is working hard and trying to support their family in this country. All they talk about is Russia and who is getting interviewed by Mueller who is subpoenaed.</p><p>And it's forcing the Democrats, they almost -- the Trump supporters want the Democrats to talk about impeachment because he's a loser.</p><p>YORK: They absolutely do. And I mean go back to 2006, if you remember, George, the Iraq War was in terrible shape, George W. Bush very unpopular. A number of Democrats were saying if we win the control of the House in 2006, there is going to be impeachment. And it really did not fly and Nancy Pelosi who wanted to be speaker, she turned out she did, basically came out and said impeachment is off the table.</p><p>Now, there are a lot more Democrats who say that if the party wins, they want Donald Trump impeached, but it's not working out that well in polls of the general electorate. So I think you're going to see a conflict inside the Democratic Party in August, September, and October about how much to emphasis the whole Trump-Russia thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron, you recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on the escalating fear that's approaching as the midterms this fall becoming increasingly imminent. You write this. Perhaps the biggest underlying question of the coming elections is the relationship between presidential job approval and the House GOP's reelection chances. It's often observed that Trump is keeping the favor of his base supporters.</p><p>He is but Republican -- something you just mentioned Republican strategists are watching his approval sink. In some educated affluent Congressional districts with lots of independent voters, the party needs to hold the House. I mean, how do you reconcile these two because we were talking to Congressman Ron DeSantis who's running for the governor of Florida earlier.</p><p>And President Trump's endorsement of this man, completely shifted the momentum away from his Republican opponent and he has a double-digit lead in the polls in Florida right now for the upcoming primary.</p><p>YORK: Absolutely turned it around for Ron DeSantis. That is of course a statewide race and all of the Congressional races are in the Congressional districts. But the big question of the midterms and nobody knows the answer, the big question is what effect will the President's job approval rating have on the voting? In the past, we have generally seen the President below 50 percent job approval rating.</p><p>It's harder for his party to keep the House. They tend to lose more seats but people wonder is Trump something different. You have to remember, his Donald Trump's personal disapproval rating was near year 60 percent on Election Day, 2016 when he was elected. And the number of smart Republicans are saying, you know, I just don't know exactly how that works.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When you say strategists, I have to chuckle, because, again, President Trump won that election by being himself and doing what he wanted to and he ignored I would say most strategists.</p><p>YORK: Oh, absolutely. The only thing here is Donald Trump is not on the ballot, you might think that by listening to this campaign but he is not on the ballot, so it's really unclear how the Trump effect will play out in these midterms.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron York, always love seeing you, sir.</p><p>YORK: Thank you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Come back soon. Coming up. Talk about a financial hangover. The shocking new study that finds Americans spend more than $30 billion in online shopping when they're drinking.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The president continues to tweet this morning. He has written this. I am looking into 3D plastic guns being sold to the public already spoke to the NRA doesn't seem to make much sense. This comes after several states are lining up to sue to stop these 3D plastic guns.</p><p>Switching gears. The housing market latest challenge finding young workers to build homes. Cheryl Casone has details on this story. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It's interesting, Dagen. Good morning. Young people apparently don't want to work in construction, Wall Street Journal reports the percentage of workers who are 24 years old or younger has fallen in nearly the entire country since the last housing boom. That was back in 2005. There is no single reason for the shortage.</p><p>But when economists in the industry says the problem is contributing to a labor shortage, that results and fewer homes being built and rising prices for buyers. Shares of two home builders (INAUDIBLE) toll brothers are both down sharply this year. I mean, sharply look at that chart.</p><p>OK. Well, in case you missed it. Kim Kardashian-West defended President Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night. No matter how hard Kimmel tried to get her to criticize the president. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIM KARDASHIAN-WEST, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY: I walk in and I'm like I look around and I'm kind of star struck from the Oval Office and the first thing I say in our meeting, I say holy [bleep] we're in the [bleep] Oval Office. That's what I said. That was the first thing I said and I had to take a moment and be like, wait, we're really here. I'm very grateful and I'm very hopeful that more good things are going to come out of our conversation.</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST: Oh, do you have a list now of people that you might ask him to release from prison?</p><p>KARDASHIAN-WEST: I do. I've been working on it.</p><p>KIMMEL: Is Melania on it? I know that you're not necessarily a Trump supporter, I know your husband Kenya seems to like him.</p><p>KARDASHIAN-WEST: I always respect what other person thinks. I have nothing bad to say about the president.</p><p>KIMMEL: Right. Because you still have people on the --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: She held her ground the whole interview, guys. She met with President back in may to discuss the release of Alice Johnson who is serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug charge in Tennessee. Johnson sentence was commuted by the President in June and she was immediately released from prison.</p><p>And then there is this. A new study says that drunk Americans really enjoy online shopping after knocking back a few. Spending a total of $30 billion online each year. More importantly what they drink impacts how much they spend. While shopping on Amazon for instance, gin drinkers tend to spend the most an average of more than $82.00. Rum and vodka drinkers in second and third place both spending 50 bucks.</p><p>Followed by those who drink white wine, red wine, tequila, beer and then the last place, I don't know what this means. Folks, but whiskey drinkers spend an average $39.00. Are whiskey drinkers cheap? I don't know. Also note, there is a surge of drunk shopping on Saturday morning around 2 a.m. Shoes and lingerie, some of the more popular items that are bought of 1,000 people surveyed who reported purchasing an item off of Amazon.</p><p>While drinking, about 50 percent said yes, they later returned their purchases.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: I will send it over to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Your reaction, Kat Timpf.</p><p>TIMPF: I mean, I'm a tequila drinker but I've definitely spent more than 40 bucks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. You tequila drinkers are like out getting in fights with people (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just joking.</p><p>TIMPF: You know, me and my bar fighting problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. No, no, no. I was just kidding.</p><p>TIMPF: Never been in a fight.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But by the way, whiskey drinkers having grown up down south bourbon drinkers having fun with friends, shooting pool, like socializing, they're not home shopping.</p><p>TIMPF: Right. Well, you know, --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like -- unlike people in New York City who were drinking gin and tonics alone on a Saturday night.</p><p>TIMPF: We can't all be popular.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you are popular, Kat. Around here you are. Coming up. We're taking America from hackers. The Department of Homeland Security has created a new cyberhub. We'll speak with the Homeland Security secretary about that ahead. Plus, crude awakening. Why one expert is predicting oil prices could surge to $400 per barrel. We didn't make that up, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: B.P. reporting a surprising second quarter profit tripling it $1.8 billion net gain. This comes after the company announced a multitude billion-dollar deal in the U.S. Shale country here to discuss, PKVerleger president and battle -- excuse, Brattle Group senior adviser, Philip Verleger. Philip, your thoughts on the state of the energy sector right now and your protection for catastrophe?</p><p>PHILIP VERLEGER, SENIOR ADVISER, BRATTLE GROUP: Catastrophe, yes. Yes, $400 is a -- is an extreme peak. Look, I'm an economist. B.P. has been doing a really great job in reshaping itself since the Macondo accident. And it's -- this is not surprising. I mean, it's why I don't follow company earnings. The B.P. people have been working extraordinarily hard to bring down costs and trying to bring the more production.</p><p>And it's -- B.P. is now leading among the super majors I think.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So --</p><p>VERLEGER: But --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go ahead, Philip. Finish your thought.</p><p>VERLEGER: Well, no, what I was going to say is -- I mean, it's -- and they will do better for the next year, a year and half as crude prices rise. You know, I don't see -- $400 is an extreme point and I used to it to make a -- try to call people's attention to this obscure regulation that could really upset the whole economy in 2000 -- you know, lead to a situation where consumers were paying $6.00, $7.00 a gallon election day 2020. Something nobody wants to see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon Hilsenrath, just to explain that. The International Maritime Organization ruled that Phillip is talking about requires shippers to use only low sulfur fuel which will shift five percent of global oil demand away from high sulfur and toward low sulfur. That's going to bring oil prices to 2008 peaks by 2020. Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean, Philip, I'd like to hear your explanation, you put the $400 a barrel oil price out there. How do you get to that and how does this one obscure regulation get you to that kind of extreme prediction?</p><p>VERLEGER: What it does is, you know, I laid out in 2005 why we're going to see a $100 oil. And the -- and same reason. It -- what it does is it put an extreme demand for low sulfur diesel fuel onto the refining system and they can't produce it. So what we're going to see is roughly a million to a million and a half barrel a day, global decline in the use of diesel fuel across the industrial sector. That's what's needed to make the fuel for the maritime organization.</p><p>For the -- for the shippers.</p><p>BELL: But Philip --</p><p>VERLEGER: It's --</p><p>BELL: Lindsey Bell, I just -- is there -- you're talking about the refiners having to change, you know, the way they refine the oil. What about --there's another alternative of shifts putting equipment onto their -- to the boat to really address the emission issue. Is that a more efficient way, is that a possible way of addressing this issue?</p><p>VERLEGER: Yes, Lindsey. That's absolutely a way. You can't -- what you have to do is put the ship and dry if off and you put the scrubber material in there. So you scrub the fuel the way you scrub on a power plant. Six percent, maybe seven percent of the world shipping capacity will have scrubber by 2020. There are 60,000 to 80,000 ships they think maybe, 6,000, 6500 ships will have scrubbers.</p><p>But that leaves a huge number of ships not and many of the large shipping companies are saying that they're going to rely on the oil industry to provide the low sulfur oil. Maersk has made that statement I believe and as the big Costco shipping company from China. So most of the, you know, most of the shipping companies keep saying, look, it is a refiner's obligation to do this. The refiners aren't prepared to make it yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Philip, it's good to see you. Please come back, sir, often.</p><p>VERLEGER: Yes. Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Philip Verleger. More Trump tweets. President Trump tweeting again this. We'll be in Tampa tonight. A big year for Congressman DeSantis who will be a great governor for Florida. Strong on crime, borders and our second amendment. Big help on tax and regulation cuts. Lovers our military and our vets. Has my full and total endorsement. Ron DeSantis who we talked to last hour still has to go up against a challenger.</p><p>The Secretary of Agriculture in the State of Florida. That run -- that primary in the Republican Party for the Republican nomination to run for governor is in August. However, President Trump's supporter Ron DeSantis has really turned around things for DeSantis. He as a double-digital lead in the polls now. Coming up. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will join us. She will weigh in on the department's security strategy, immigration and much more.</p><p>Plus, a new warning for Morgan Stanley. Why the firm is predicting the biggest correction since February pointing to earnings misses from Facebook and Netflix which are now in bear market territory, down more than 20 percent each from their recent highs. We'll be right back.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report. A special presentation for Fox Business. I'm Dani Klupenger. Former number one Andy Murray made his return to the ATP World Tour at the Citi Open Monday. But the three-time major champion was far from his bet.</p><p>Mackenzie McDonald took full advantage of a slow start from the Scott. He's making his comeback after hip surgery. The American closing out the opener 6-3. But a slight struggling with his mobility. Murray managed to claw his lead back into the match, leveling it up after taking the second 6-4.</p><p>Sheer determination got Murray across the finish line as he wraps up the hard-fought win 7-5 deep in the decider. But it doesn't get easier, up next, countryman and top 20 star, Kyle Edmund. And don't forget, Tennis Channel's exclusive coverage of the city open from Washington D.C. continues Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern. I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Three Dow components among the big names reporting earnings today; Pfizer and Procter &amp; Gamble already out with their numbers, some mixed reports there. But this -- and you can see, Pfizer's stock down more than one percent. Procter &amp; Gamble stock, this is premarket trading, down more than three percent. Again, it was a revenue miss for Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>We've got Apple reporting this afternoon, however, will Apple be able to turn around the likes of Facebook and Twitter? Talk about Facebook and Netflix, those stocks as of yesterday in bear market territory, they are down more than 20 percent from their recent highs. We'll see if Apple can buck that trend.</p><p>Futures are showing this right now, we've had gains across the board all morning, reversing losses yesterday, 24-point gain on the Dow Futures. Numbers on personal income and spending, come -- just hitting the wires, both personal income and spending rising four-tenths of one percent, in line with the economists' expectations. The core PCE Index which is the Fed's chosen indicator for inflation, rising 1.9 percent compared to a year ago. So, based on that inflation, looks pretty tame.</p><p>In Europe, we look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains in -- on the FTSE 100 in England and the CAC Quarante in France, the DAX heading lower, losing one-quarter of one percent. The Asian markets mostly higher, the Hang Seng the only loser there, down half of one percent.</p><p>Are the bears knocking at the door? Analysts at Morgan Stanley say stocks could be in for the biggest correction since February. We have details coming up on that. Plus, building the wall, President Trump speaking out again yesterday on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Unlike President Obama, I just want great border security. Our countries have learned through hard experience that border security is national security, they are one and the same.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President threatening a government shutdown over border security funding but one administration official tells the Wall Street Journal that the fight will happen after the midterm elections. Roseanne got the boot, Director James Gunn gets fired, one comedian says that we should just take it easy and stop being so sensitive to everything. You cannot wait to hear from her.</p><p>And now, to the top story this half hour, protecting America, the Department of Homeland Security hosting a cybersecurity summit today. That's where we find Deirdre Bolton, she is live in New York City with the Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. Good morning, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen. I certainly am. And I pleased to welcome, of course, Secretary Nielsen. Thank you so much for the time today.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: My pleasure.</p><p>BOLTON: So, you have this huge cybersecurity summit. You are hosting it today, you have the head of the FBI, you have the head of the NSA, you have Vice President Mike Pence, and then you also have tons of business leaders, CEOs from tech, and banking, and energy. What is the biggest threat right now to our infrastructure?</p><p>NIELSEN: The biggest threat in my mind is if we don't partner. So, what we see the adversary is doing is they're crowdsourcing. So, they're using bots, they're using paid influencers, they're using their governments, they're using anyone and everyone that can attack us. So, the biggest threat is if we don't work together to counter that.</p><p>BOLTON: So, give me, if you don't mind, Secretary, in order of aggressivity, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, unknown. So, that's one through five, who's attacking us the most?</p><p>NIELSEN: OK. So, it's a good question. They all have slightly different note. So, I would say Russia is very active, they'll continue to be active, we've seen meddling in the election, we've seen meddling with our industrial control systems, we've seen meddling with routers. China has more of a long view, so they're looking more to understand our systems particularly in government, understand who's who, get different access to systems. Iran we see very active and North Korea both but general in their regions. So, they have the capability, we know they have the intent but we don't see them quite as active towards us.</p><p>BOLTON: So, what's our response, what's our strategy? You attack us, we hit back 10 times as hard? What can we do to take away an incentive to keep trying to figure out our systems?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. I mean, I (INAUDIBLE) we do have to move from complacency to consequences and I think you've seen that. So, whether it's through legal means such as indictments, whether it's through sanctions through the Treasury Department, whether it's through diplomatic means such as P&amp;G, we have to have consequences for the activities. We have to call them out and hold them responsible.</p><p>BOLTON: So, you're creating a risk management center, and it goes back to this point about coordination, where you really feel the government and private enterprise needs to be coordinated because some business leaders have complained, like, even when I think I'm hacked I don't know who to call.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: Is this the answer, the risk management center.</p><p>NIELSEN: (INAUDIBLE) never call 911. We saw that happened before (INAUDIBLE) communities. No, I think it is. So, how it is now, we have different intel that comes in so we collate at the government level, all the intel unclass and classified. But we needed the private sector perspective to understand the context to which to imply that intel. So, for example, working very closely with the energy sector, the finance sector, and the com sector, if we have a piece of intel, we can see how it fits in to their operational environment and how it could affect them. That helps us prepare, helps them prepare, and helps us be ready for the systemic threats.</p><p>BOLTON: So, you mentioned energy, I've heard some people say, parts of our system are so old that it's actually hard to hack, but then we've seen evidence of Russia actually having a certain amount of success in breaching some ports which normally shouldn't have been breached. How do you see it?</p><p>NIELSEN: They're trying, for sure. I mean, I think they have some capabilities that's seen in Ukraine, they sort of continue to scan and attempt to access our systems in the U.S. There was one limited distribution asset that they did attack. It would not have had effect on the larger grid, but your point is valid. So, working very closely with the Department of Energy and Secretary Perry will be joining us today to help give the perspective from the energy sector.</p><p>BOLTON: Of all the systems that we have, whether it's banking or whether it's internet security, or whether it's the energy grid, what are you most worried about? What keeps you up at night in this cyber context?</p><p>NIELSEN: I'm just worried about being behind, right? So, they continue to innovate daily, sometimes by the minute in terms of their different ways that they're attacking us. So, we have to keep up. They're crowdsourcing their attacks that I mentioned earlier so we have to have that partnership. But really, it's evolving threats. So, I worry that at given times, we might not have the authority and resources we need to combat them effectively. So, it's moving towards our toes.</p><p>BOLTON: When you talk about resources, what is it like for you to recruit because I'm thinking of computer scientists coming out of MIT would (INAUDIBLE) I mean, that's who you need. You need these code breakers, you need these hackers. It's easier for them to go and work in Silicon Valley.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, it is. It's much more lucrative. We're working on a variety of different initiatives, everything from exchanging partners with the private sector, so we have a loan executive program, but we also actually are doing something that I think is quite innovative which is working with GSA to develop a whole new GSA system to hire federal employees, that's really based on their skill sets in cyber which might not necessarily equate to the traditional educational requirements.</p><p>BOLTON: Now, I know as we talked about it, you have CEOs here. How cooperative is private enterprise with the government. There's a lot of people who don't trust the government.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, it's taken the DHS about 15 years old, it's taken us probably all 15 of those years to build up the trust. When used to say we're from the government, we're here to help, it wasn't really something people wanted to hear, but I think what you'll hear from the CEOs today is they're coming committed to this partnership, committed -- and that's the full -- it's not just for smiles, it's not just when the attack happens but it's on the planning, the risk assessment, the prioritization, really understand that interdependent fabric between all the sectors.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. We know, for example, at the border, Microsoft specifically saying we don't want our facial recognition technology used there. What is your opinion on that?</p><p>NIELSEN: I will see to Microsoft their thoughts on that, but sometimes the biometric technology is actually fastest way to confirm an identity. So, we use facial recognition in limited ways right now within the air domain, within aviation, and we find that vastly increases the ability of (INAUDIBLE) of passengers. So, if it's something we can do faster to make it more efficient while still keeping it secured, at DHS, we'll always look for opportunities.</p><p>BOLTON: Secretary Nielsen, before we let you go, how do you see this idea of a border wall fitting in with immigration policy and how that fits with security and cybersecurity?</p><p>NIELSEN: So, all of this together, we're sort of talking about different walls, aren't we? So, on the border, walls work. We've seen that in (INAUDIBLE) we've seen that in San Diego, we've seen that in other countries. When the wall goes out, it does absolutely serve as not just a deterrent but a physical barrier that makes it much more difficult to access. The same can be true of cyber, so what we're looking at is a system of systems of approach, some are firewalls, but much more than that, it's monitoring on the systems, looking at the network traffic, identifying the threat indicator sharing, mitigation measures. So, similar to immigration, you have to have -- you have to have many, many layers of security in order to assure ourselves we're protecting Americans.</p><p>BOLTON: Do you think we're going to see a shutdown based on this issue?</p><p>NIELSEN: I think the president has been clear as to what he believes is needed for border security, but from my perspective, we'll continue to work with the appropriators and work with Congress so I can make sure that the men and women of DHS have what they need to do their jobs.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Secretary Nielsen, thank you for the time. We appreciate it. Enjoy the summit.</p><p>NIELSEN: Thank you. We will. Great.</p><p>BOLTON: Dagen, back to you and studio.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Deirdre, thank you for that interview and thanks to the Secretary as well. Coming up, a new warning from Morgan Stanley, why the firm is predicting a correction. And after Facebook and Netflix, they're now in the bear market territory, down 20 percent as of yesterday. And Leslie Jones is speaking out about comedians being politically correct. Stuart Varney is here to weigh in, and I can't wait, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESLIE JONES, COMEDIAN: Stop walking around, so offended. You're not going to be able to survive life if you walk around offended. Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Comedians underfire. That was \"Saturday Night Live!\" star Leslie Jones. She's amazing, love her. Telling the ladies of \"The View\" that everyone needs to just get a life, to paraphrase. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. Hey, Stuart.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, look, I'm glad we decided to highlight this because, you know, it's a part of life, isn't it? You watch those late night comedians, they're awful, they don't make me laugh, they are not funny. I've just had a nice three-day weekend and I took a little time to see some of these late night guys, useless! I mean, they're so negative, so hostile, it's all so political, so divisive, I really welcome Leslie Jones' statement there, and she made it on of all places, \"The View.\"</p><p>She's saying, look, \"You can't go through life if you are offended by everything, you got to laugh.\" I think her message is, especially those young people who watch the late night guys, you can't go through life like this, you can't start out being opposed to everything and being sensitive to the slightest slight, you can't do that. I think her message is very important, and I hope it's picked up by other comedians who make it -- who bring back comedy, where you're watching their act and you laugh at it, you laugh with them, you laugh at them, you laugh at the jokes, you smile. If we could get back to that, I'd be delighted, not that I will be watching late night television any time soon again, but it would make a nice change to our life, wouldn't it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Stuart, I will turn this back on itself, because part of what she is saying is there are a lot of people who when those late night comedians -- I agree, I haven't heard once anything funny in a long time from them, but Trump supporters who listen to them, when they try to make a joke about the President, or about Republicans, anything that anyone says, that's meant to be a joke is offensive. And so, in part, that's what Leslie Jones is referring to.</p><p>VARNEY: I agree. Yes, that's what -- that's what she's also saying, lighten up. Come on, lighten up. The job of a comedian is to make me smile, it's to make me laugh, and that whole profession of comedians has forgotten that message, and I think Leslie Jones is absolute right to bring it back again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and she's also saying that people who go to these comedy shows, who watch all of these -- the myriad Netflix specials by comediennes and that a lot -- it's not just the comedians, it's the people watching them. They literally come to the table with a list of things that will offend them, down to do not make fun of people who love cats. I love cats, I'm offended by you making fun of cat lovers. It's that granular, and that's why people are walking around, as my mother says, with a mad on all of the time.</p><p>VARNEY: Right. Didn't have you have Jimmy Kimmel with Kim Kardashian, trying to make her go after Mr. Trump or be snide in some ways towards him. Well, that's just typical, isn't it? Well, what are they thinking of? I mean, is that funny? Is that what you want to do with your late night spot? I can't believe it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've made fun of Kim Kardashian a lot or criticized that family a lot, however, I will say this, she held her ground with him. She said, I'm not going to say anything negative. And you know what, she deserves a lot of credit for that.</p><p>VARNEY: Look, I think she deserves a lot of credit for making an enormous amount of money without being really good at anything other than being famous. And that, to me, is remarkable feat.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's a -- we'd take that job, too, I think, if we could get it, just being -- making -- being rich for just being yourself. I think that we'll take that if we can do it, but we have to have other skills.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, it wouldn't work with me, I'm afraid. It just wouldn't work. There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, nobody understands what I'm saying. I'm out of time anyways, so good luck with that. Stuart, I love you dearly.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY: See you later.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He will be up in less than 10 minutes, every weekday 9:00 a.m. to noon, Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Coming up, Morgan Stanley is warning a correction is looming after earnings misses from Facebook and Netflix. We are breaking down the details, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Investors losing their taste for some key technology stocks, Facebook and Netflix both yesterday, closing in bear market territory, down more than 20 percent from their recent record highs, hit earlier this month. This comes as analysts at Morgan Stanley believe a major sell-off is on the way for the broader markets. Joining us now, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence portfolio manager Erin Gibbs. What do you make of this, is it going to be these tech stocks that lead the broader market lower?</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE: I think it's an overstatement to say that just a couple stocks that have been missing, and yes, they have missed at extreme levels are going to draw all of the entire market down. When you look at the broader S&amp;P 500, we're actually trading at really regional valuations. We're looking at 22 percent growth, and when you look at the beat rates for just for a second quarter and guidance, where the stocks are beating at about an 82 percent rate, that's really high, that's like 10 percent higher than normal. So, the broader market actually looks pretty healthy and while technology has a huge impact on it, I don't see it being able to take the entire market down. And the market is only up four percent year-to-date. I don't see that suddenly making, like, us wiping out all of the gains that we've achieved this year.</p><p>TIMPF: Well, I think that this report by Morgan Stanley is it's looking at lagging indicators, it's looking at GDP, it's looking at earnings, so those are lagging indicators. If you look at leading indicators like the stock market and manufacturing data, that's all been really strong. Where do you when you think about investing for the second half of the year, where are you putting your money?</p><p>GIBBS: So for us, we've been talking about the difference between the value and growth stocks for a few weeks now, and when you look at the return of growth stocks, they're up about 10 percent year-to-date and values only up about two percent. So, value has been the big laggard and that's definitely -- if you want safety, that's the place that's not going down because you just haven't seen this huge uptick, and that could be an area perhaps later in the year. I'd say it's a little earlier now, August tends to be a bad month anyway, it tends to be a rough month, but I would say in the fall, if -- particularly if we see any preference towards financials, we really start seeing interest rates, the yield curve go higher, that could be an area.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of interest rates, the Federal Reserve meets this week, not expected to raise interest rates but, again, what will investors be looking at?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean, they're going to be looking at how the Fed describes how the economy is doing, that really is what changes in their statement that comes out tomorrow. I mean, the Fed has going to have to be positive on the economy. You know, four percent growth in the second quarter, inflation that's reaching its target. You know, I think they're going to be projecting at least one more interest rate increase and probably too before the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then we got a big old jobs report out on Friday. So, 190,000 jobs expected right now. Erin Gibbs, thank you so much, great to see you. Next time, more time, promise. We'll be right back, everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kat Timpf, Jon Hilsenrath, Lindsey Bell, come back one and all, thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, it does. And good morning to you, Dagen. And good morning, everyone. Apple reports today, it's the last of the big tech highflyers to lay out the financial results.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018073103cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXN-MC81-DXH2-628R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 31, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000DAH9</classCode><className>BANK OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Apple</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bank of Japan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jimmy Kimmel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FAANG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Procter &amp;

The President said it's \"unfair what's going on with the conservative voice\" and \"you'd solve the entire problem of the various, you know, monopolists, if you ever voided\" Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. He added that an overall antitrust law modernization \"could happen,\" but cautioned that \"you've got a lot of forces against, with antitrust.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barr: Social Media Giants \"Starting To Censor\" Views With Which They Disagree.</p><p>Attorney General Barr, on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures (6/21, 2.08M), discussed the DOJ's plan to roll back legal protections on technology companies. Barr said, \"The basic idea is that if you're acting as essentially a bulletin board...and you're not being selective about it, it's open to all comers, you shouldn't be deemed a publisher. We want to encourage that kind of forum for third-party views. That ran into problems because we wanted to encourage, during the early days of the internet, platforms to take off obscene material or harassing material or other kinds of offensive material like that. What we said was in the law, Section 230, if you take that down, that doesn't make you a publisher - if you take down objectionable material like that. Unfortunately, they started taking down viewpoints and started really being selective and based on whether they agreed with the viewpoint or not taking it down. And that should make them a publisher.\" Bloomberg (6/21, Yang, 4.73M) reports Barr also \"said social media giants are 'starting to censor' views and antitrust law can be used to address their dominance, doubling down on Justice Department proposals to limit legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.\"</p><p>NYTimes' Smith Examines Trump/Facebook Relationship.</p><p>Ben Smith of the New York Times (6/21, 18.61M) explores the relationship between President Trump and Facebook, reporting that the President, First Lady, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner dined last fall with Facebook board member Peter Thiel and his husband at the White House. Smith says the \"unusual gathering\" was \"something in between a high-stakes state dinner between the leaders of uneasily allied superpowers and the awkward rehearsal dinner before a marriage that has both families a little rattled.\" Smith asks if Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"reach[ed] some kind of accommodation,\" writing that Zuckerberg \"needs, and appears to be getting, a pass both on angry tweets from the president and the serious threats of lawsuits and regulation that face other big tech companies,\" while the President has maintained \"access to Facebook's advertising platform and its viral power.\"</p><p>Twitter Suspended Commentator Whose Posts Have Been Shared By Trump.</p><p>The Washington Times (6/20, Blake, 492K) reports Twitter \"said Friday it permanently suspended Katie Hopkins, a conservative British commentator whose posts on the platform had been shared by President Trump on several occasions.\" A Twitter spokesperson told the Times, \"Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us - abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our Rules are broken.\" The spokesperson added, \"In this case, the account has been permanently suspended for violations of our Hateful Conduct policy.\" The Times also says that Twitter \"did not specify what tweet or tweets prompted the social media service to permanently ban Ms. Hawkins.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRNTRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRNTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6067-8Y21-JBSJ-9180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160011</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>The Frontrunner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 22, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But the president's comments during an interview on Fox Business came just weeks after federal competition regulators at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission divvied up scrutiny of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, a move that could suggest the government is in the early stages of an investigation into those tech giants.</p><p>In doing so, Trump also swiped at Google, claiming the search and advertising giant is \"trying to rig the election.\" He then claimed that Twitter has made it \"very hard\" for users to find and follow him. But Trump did not provide new evidence for his latest allegation that the companies exhibit bias against conservatives, which Google and Twitter long have vehemently denied.</p><p>\"You may need legislation in order to create competition,\" Trump said in response to a question about how his administration might proceed.</p><p>In response, Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo said the company seeks \"to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without any regard for political viewpoint.\" Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Twitter declined to comment. The White House declined to elaborate on Trump's remarks. </p><p>Trump's attacks Wednesday only add to Silicon Valley's mounting political headaches in Washington, where even bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans have sounded similar alarms about the growing size and power of big tech companies. The bipartisan frustrations could be on full display later Wednesday, when Democratic candidates for president appear at the party's first-ever 2020 election debate. Many top candidates have expressed support for investigating big tech on antitrust grounds.</p><p>Such investigations at the DOJ and FTC are supposed to be independent of political influence from the White House. Even Trump's reference to lawsuits could provoke the ire of congressional Democrats, who repeatedly have criticized the president out of concern he's interfered in past competition-related matters such as AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner Cable, a deal that included CNN.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly has attacked Facebook, Twitter and other social-media sites, claiming that they exhibit bias against conservatives. In May, the White House took the unprecedented step of calling for a public survey to report personal stories about people who say they have been unfairly censored online for their political views, a move that drew sharp criticism from open government and free speech advocates.</p><p>This time, Trump's comments came in response to a video posted online by Project Veritas, an organization founded by James O'Keefe that targets reporters and people it deems to be left-leaning. The video purported to show Google employees discussing politics in a way that suggested they specifically targeted conservatives. But the clip had been recorded in secret, without the Google executive's permission or knowledge, and she later said that Project Veritas had edited the video in a duplicitous way.</p><p>Earlier this year, Trump had pressed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about allegations of bias at a private White House meeting. Twitter long has maintained that Trump, who has more than 61 million followers, experiences fluctuations in his follower count because of the company's effort to find and remove spam accounts.</p><p>Following Trump's comments Wednesday, the White House announced it planned to convene \"digital leaders\" for a meeting on July 11, which spokesman Judd Deere described as a \"robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\" The White House did not elaborate on who it planned to invite.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-4e3f71adb0d14a31871158fb323f9132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF1-VSG1-DXKP-J1PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><timeReceived>2:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002H12</classCode><className>TIME WARNER CABLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump's \"American AI Initiative[3]\" directs federal agencies to prioritize AI in their research and development, however it did not announce any specific funding assigned for these goals.It also includes language aimed at increasing efforts to educate American workers using a mix of programs spearheaded by the National Council for the American Worker and AI fellowships care of federal agencies. In addition, it calls upon the government to improve access to cloud computing and data-sharing for the development of new AI systems.The executive order comes amid growing concerns over China's push[4] to become a global AI superpower and the threat of job losses in the impending age of automation[5]. The initiative also urges federal branches to establish a regulatory framework for AI across industrial sectors. This despite the Trump administration's past assurances[6] to big tech that it would take a hands-off approach to the field.

The big picture: The order focuses on a portion of the Communications Decency Act known as Section 230, which grants broad liability protections to tech platforms from civil suits when it comes to what users post, and would direct the Commerce Department to press the Federal Communications Commission to create new regulations aimed at pulling back that shield. It also asks the Federal Trade Commission to report on acts of political bias collected by the White House. Attorney General Bill Barr said that the administration is preparing legislation as well.The Trump administration has long mulled reining in Section 230, and the Justice Department convened a workshop[8] earlier this year on the topic. Trump said he expects the executive order to draw a lawsuit. Reality check: Despite this executive order, the president does not have unilateral power to regulate tech companies and social media platforms. This week a federal appeals court[9], ruling in a case brought by conservative activists against social media companies, affirmed that private websites are not public spaces and social media companies don't have First Amendment obligations.Any truly strong limits to Section 230 would almost certainly require action by Congress.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in a series of tweets[10] Wednesday that he would introduce legislation to strip platforms of their protections if they offer what he described as editorializing. Worth noting: Section 230 has long had critics on both the right and the left of the political spectrum, who argue that it allows platforms to shirk a societal responsibility to keep harmful and false information from spreading online. Its authors wanted to make it clear that online services could actively moderate their users' content without assuming liability for it, though platforms still must police things like copyright violations.Among Democrats, House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff cited deepfake videos[11] last year as a key issue that called Section 230 protections into question, arguing that tech companies need to \"exercise a proper standard of care when it comes to a whole variety of fraudulent or illicit content.\" [ 1]: <url

Currently, social media giants, like Twitter, receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they're a neutral platform - which they're an editor with a viewpoint,\" Trump told reporters after he signed an executive order on Thursday.<br/>The executive order calls for new regulations, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield. \"That's a big deal. They have a shield; they can do what they want. They have a shield. They're not going to have that shield,\" Trump asserted.<br/>Trump said that the executive order further instructs the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit social media companies from engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.<br/>This authority resides in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, he said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Trump also said he was directing the Attorney General to work cooperatively with the States.<br/>\"He's going to be working very much and very closely in cooperation with the states to enforce their own laws against such deceptive business practices. The states have brought in powerful authority to regulate in this arena, and they'll be doing it also and we encourage them to do it - if they see exactly as we've been seeing,\" he noted.<br/>The President said that a handful of powerful social media monopolies controlled a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States.<br/>\"We know what they are; we don't have to name them,\" he said.<br/>These social media outlets have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences, he said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction. And that includes individual people controlling vast amounts of territory,\" he said.<br/>Asserting that his administration can't allow that to happen, especially when they go about doing what they are doing, because they are doing things incorrectly.<br/>\"They have points of view. And if we go by that, it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016. But we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair,\" he said.<br/>The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple. They are editorial decisions.\u00a0 In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform, and they become an editor with a viewpoint, he asserted.<br/>\"I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook and perhaps others,\" Trump said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"One egregious example is when they try to silence views that they disagree with by selectively applying a \"fact check\" - a fact check -- F-A-C-T. Fact check.\u00a0 What they choose to fact check and what they choose to ignore or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group or political activism. It is inappropriate,\" he said.<br/>\"This censorship and bias is a threat to freedom itself. Imagine if your phone company silenced or edited your conversation. Social media companies have vastly more power and more reach than any phone company in the United States. More reach, actually, than your newspapers, by far. More reach than a lot of your traditional forms of communication,\" Trump said.<br/>He said he is directing his administration to develop policies and procedures to ensure taxpayer dollars are not going into any social media company that represses free speech.<br/>\"The government spends billions of dollars on giving them money. They're rich enough. So we're going to be doing none of it or a very little of it,\" he said.<br/>\"As President, I'll not allow the American people to be bullied by these giant corporations. Many people have wanted this to be done by presidents for a long time. Now we're doing it. I'm sure they'll be doing a lawsuit, and I'm also sure that we're going to be going for legislation, in addition to this. The legislation will start immediately,\" said the president.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Earlier in a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that it was time to, quote, \"get the facts\" about Twitter and other social media platforms targeting their bias against President Trump and conservatives online.<br/>\"Twitter's head of site integrity has tweeted that there are, quote, 'actual Nazis' in the White House, and no fact-check label was ever applied to this absolutely outrageous, offensive, and false claim made against the White House and its employees,\" she said.<br/>\"While big tech is quick to censor the President, quick to censor some of his top employees, they are very reluctant, it seems, to label some of the actions by Chinese officials, some of the misinformation that has been spread by China,\" she said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMED-M-1005911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-2341-JBYT-H0DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428672</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Media news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This story is breaking. Check back for updates.President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday threatening penalties against social media companies over allegations of bias against conservatives.\"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" he told pool reporters before signing the document.The move comes two days after Twitter added fact-checking links \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 to two of Trump's tweets pushing false claims about voting by mail.According to a leaked draft of the order, Trump is primarily seeking to empower federal regulators to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives social-media companies broad authority to moderate speech on their platforms.Section 230 also stipulates that tech companies are not responsible for comments and other content that users post on their platforms.Trump's order calls for tech companies to lose their Section 230 protection if they do anything to discriminate against users, restrict their access to a platform without giving them a fair hearing, or take other action that isn't in line with the terms of service.A draft of the order obtained by Business Insider[2] on Wednesday said that within 30 days of its signing, the Secretary of Commerce should file a petition for rulemaking within the Federal Communications Commission for regulations that clarify the scope of Section 230.It also said the head of each executive department and agency should review federal spending on advertising and marketing paid to online platforms.Additionally, the draft order directs the Federal Trade Commission to take action to prohibit \"deceptive or unfair practices,\" and allow people to complain if they think the companies are acting in a way that goes against their own rules and practices.\"As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the Internet. </p><p>Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our businesses, our newspapers, and our homes,\" the draft reads. \"In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online.\" Trump fights fact-checking and alleged 'censorship' Thursday's executive order is the Trump administration's latest attack on big technology companies in a back-and-forth that has been going on since Trump took office. The president enjoys a large following on Twitter and Facebook advertising helped him get elected in 2016, but conservatives have accused technology companies of being biased against them for the past couple of years.There have been White House summits, congressional hearings, and draft legislation on the matter, but nothing that specifically aims to regulate social media companies for allegations of censorship has been successful yet.Asked Thursday whether he would delete his Twitter account, Trump said, \"If we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat,\" adding that his social media presence allows him to reach more people.The president doubled down on claims of bias after Twitter fact-checked his tweets this week in which he claimed that mail-in ballots in California are \"substantially fraudulent\" and will result in a \"Rigged Election.\"Twitter's alert linked to a \"Moments\" page[3] titled \"Trump makes unsubstantiated claim that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud\" that listed a series of facts contradicting his claims.On Wednesday, Twitter elaborated[4] on its decision to fact-check the president's tweets, writing, \"We added a label to two @realDonaldTrump Tweets about California's vote-by-mail plans as part of our efforts to enforce our civic integrity policy. We believe those Tweets could confuse voters about what they need to do to receive a ballot and participate in the election process.\" \u2014Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) May 28, 2020[5] Trump, meanwhile, accused the social media platform of\"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election[6]\" and said he wouldn't allow Twitter to stifle free speech.\"We will strongly regulate, or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen,\" he tweeted Wednesday morning.Trump  teased the executive order again in a tweet later that day, writing, \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"Despite the president's threats, however, First Amendment experts say[7] he does not have the power to regulate or shut down social-media companies because he disagrees with them. Tech policy experts echoed that assessment[8], telling Business Insider that parts of the executive order are not legal at all, while other sections would require agencies to throw out years of judicial precedent.That said, the role of social media companies in combatting the spread of misinformation will likely be a recurring issue in the run-up to the election.Just hours before Trump signed his executive order, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took aim at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, telling Fox News in an interview, \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\"Dorsey hit back at Zuckerberg, tweeting, \"We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'\"He added: \"Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.\"Democrats have been heavily critical of social media companies, most prominently Facebook, that have refused to crack down on misinformation on their platforms.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg[9] of pandering to Trump by criticizing Twitter's decision to fact-check his tweets and insisting that Facebook cannot be an \"arbiter of truth.\"Pelosi argued during a press conference that Facebook is chiefly driven by a desire to maximize profits, including by avoiding taxes and regulation, while \"hid[ing] under freedom of speech.\"\"Facebook, all of them, they're all about making money,\" she said. \"Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts ... and they defend that.\"She also called Trump's executive order \"silly\" and said it was \"a distraction\" from the coronavirus pandemic.

The Trump administration has faced widespread accusations that it has mishandled the crisis.</p><p>Currently, social media giants like Twitter received unprecedented viability shield based on the theory that they are a neutral platform, which they are not, the US president said in the Oval Office on Thursday. We are fed up with it. It is unfair, and its been very unfair.</p><p>Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies currently enjoy broad immunity from civil lawsuits stemming from what users post because they are treated as platforms rather than publishers.</p><p>Trumps executive order is designed to pressure regulators, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, to come up with new rules that would curtail that immunity. It is likely to face legal challenges.</p><p>As he prepared to sign the order, the president added: Theyve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.</p><p>There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.</p><p>The move was welcomed by observers who argue that Facebook and Twitter should be held responsible for their content and subject to the same laws as the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.</p><p>But many in the business and technology sectors argue the order could curb freedom of speech on the internet and it conflicts with existing law which only Congress, not the president - can change.</p><p>Matt Schruers, the president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, told the Associated Press: The irony that is lost here is that if these protections were to go away social media services would be far more aggressive in moderating content and terminating accounts. Our vibrant public sphere of discussion would devolve into nothing more than preapproved soundbites.</p><p>Gary Shapiro, the president and chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, said: We oppose todays unconstitutional, ill-considered executive order. The free speech protections in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are the legal underpinning of our vibrant US online economy and our nations global digital leadership.</p><p>Americas internet companies lead the world and it is incredible that our own political leaders would seek to censor them for political purposes. These same politicians extensively advertise on them and just a few minutes online will reveal these platforms contain a multitude of political views.</p><p>Section 230 protects these companies as well as any start-up website which hosts others speech from community bulletin boards to social media sites to the Fox News comments section.</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement: We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system.</p><p>Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.</p><p>Many sceptics regard Trumps action as politically motivated ahead of the November election. He and other conservatives have long accused social media companies of liberal or pro-China bias, even as Twitter has this week allowed the president to tweet baseless conspiracy theories accusing a TV host of murder .</p><p>Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, said big tech can no longer go unchecked. For too long, social media platforms like Twitter have hid behind their opaque algorithms and Section 230 immunity to target speech with which they disagree and advance their own political agendas, he added.</p><p>This doesnt just stifle Americans free speech; it shapes what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think about the major issues facing our country, including how those issues should be addressed and who should be elected to address them.</p><p>Brad Parscale, the Trump 2020 campaign manager, said on Thursday: Social media has been allowed to operate unchecked for years while enjoying the protection of federal law.</p><p>These Silicon Valley giants have set themselves up as the arbiters of truth, censoring or labeling posts they disagree with, but they have shown that they cannot be trusted to be honest and fair. We have known for a long time that social media companies have it in for conservatives in general and President Trump specifically.</p><p>But, critics say, after Twitters intervention on Trumps false claims about mail-in voting, the company merely became the latest convenient punchbag for him to cultivate victimhood, rile up his base and deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic death toll.</p><p>Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, warned: Donald Trumps order is plainly illegal. After driving our country into an economic and health care disaster, Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread unfiltered lies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECONNW-en290539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECONNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NNT-J961-F0R9-T2D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RIA OREANDA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The executive order calls on government regulators to evaluate if online platforms should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users. If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat Internet platforms as \"publishers\" potentially liable for user-generated content. Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences\". \"We can't let this continue to happen,\" Trump said. </p><p>The move comes a day after an angry tirade from the US leader against Twitter after the platform for the first time labelled two of his tweets, on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting, with fact-check notices, calling them misleading. \"In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint,\" Trump said. \"And I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook, perhaps others.\" READ: Trump threatens to regulate or shut down social media companies INTERNET GIANTS RESPOND Twitter called the order \"a reactionary and politicised approach to a landmark law\" and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would \"threaten the future of online speech.\" A Google spokeswoman said the order would harm \"America's economy,\" while a Facebook spokesman said it would \"encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.\" \"PRESIDENT'S SPEECH POLICE\" Critics said however Trump has no authority to regulate private Internet operators or change the law known as Section 230 which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish. The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order \"a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president\". Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was \"more about political theater than about changing the law\". The order \"is not legally supportable - it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions\", Goldman said. The White House seeks to sidestep the provisions giving Internet firms immunity by treating them as publishers operating in part of a \"public square\". \"Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,\" the executive order said. READ: Trump move could scrap or weaken law that protects social media companies While the Trump order would not prevent platforms from moderating content, it could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online. Critics said the action represents a dangerous effort by the government to regulate online speech. \"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order. Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States\". WADING INTO QUAGMIRE Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican and fierce critic of social media, said that if online firms \"are going to editorialise and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government\". But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, one of the authors of the 1996 law, called Trump's order a \"plainly illegal\" political ploy. \"Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread lies,\" Wyden said. READ: Twitter places fact-check notification on Trump tweet about mail-in ballots FACT CHECK FURY A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful. Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users. The massive amount of unverified content in circulation has prompted a rise in fact-checking operations, including a vast Facebook effort in which AFP plays a role. After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims. Trump had tweeted - without any evidence - that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November. Some analysts claimed the president's arguments against Twitter had turned upside down the interpretation of the constitution's First Amendment, designed to prevent the government from limiting free expression. \"The First Amendment applies to the government not to private actors like Twitter,\" wrote law professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown University in the Washington Post. \"Trump is wrong on the law, but this time he's even more wrong than usual. There is someone violating the First Amendment on Twitter, but it's not Twitter - it's Trump.\" - Agencies/aa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12782388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-06M1-JCDN-100W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><timeReceived>2:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order.</p><p>Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.\"</p><p>- Wading into quagmire -</p><p>Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican and fierce critic of social media, said that if online firms \"are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government.\"</p><p>But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, one of the authors of the 1996 law, called Trump's order a \"plainly illegal\" political ploy.</p><p>\"Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread lies,\" Wyden said.</p><p>- Fact check fury -</p><p>A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful.</p><p>Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users.</p><p>The massive amount of unverified content in circulation has prompted a rise in fact-checking operations, including a vast Facebook effort in which AFP plays a role.</p><p>After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims.</p><p>Trump had tweeted -- without any evidence -- that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November.</p><p>Some analysts claimed the president's arguments against Twitter had turned upside down the interpretation of the constitution's First Amendment, designed to prevent the government from limiting free expression.</p><p>\"The First Amendment applies to the government not to private actors like Twitter,\" wrote law professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown University in the Washington Post.</p><p>\"Trump is wrong on the law, but this time he's even more wrong than usual. There is someone violating the First Amendment on Twitter, but it's not Twitter -- it's Trump.\"</p><p>sms-rl/acb</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Trump signs order targeting social media after tweets flagged </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600X-F391-DY93-M04S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><timeReceived>11:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

US President Donald Trump, flanked by Attorney General William Barr, prepares to sign an executive order on social media companies in the Oval Office on May, 28, 2020 Photo: AFP / Brendan Smialowski \"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order.Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp;#38; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.\"Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans.Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican and fierce critic of social media, said that if online firms \"are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government.\"But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, one of the authors of the 1996 law, called Trump's order a \"plainly illegal\" political ploy.\"Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread lies,\" Wyden said.A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful.Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users.The massive amount of unverified content in circulation has prompted a rise in fact-checking operations, including a vast Facebook effort in which AFP plays a role.After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims.Trump had tweeted -- without any evidence -- that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November.Some analysts claimed the president's arguments against Twitter had turned upside down the interpretation of the constitution's First Amendment, designed to prevent the government from limiting free expression.\"The First Amendment applies to the government not to private actors like Twitter,\" wrote law professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown University in the Washington Post.\"Trump is wrong on the law, but this time he's even more wrong than usual. There is someone violating the First Amendment on Twitter, but it's not Twitter -- it's Trump.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159071315139625876100048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N4F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><timeReceived>12:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp;#38; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.\"Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican and fierce critic of social media, said that if online firms \"are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government.\" But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, one of the authors of the 1996 law, called Trump's order a \"plainly illegal\" political ploy. \"Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread lies,\" Wyden said.A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful. Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users. The massive amount of unverified content in circulation has prompted a rise in fact-checking operations, including a vast Facebook effort in which AFP plays a role. After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequently unfactual posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims. Trump had tweeted -- without any evidence -- that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November. Some analysts claimed the president's arguments against Twitter had turned upside down the interpretation of the constitution's First Amendment, designed to prevent the government from limiting free expression. \"The First Amendment applies to the government not to private actors like Twitter,\" wrote law professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown University in the Washington Post. \"Trump is wrong on the law, but this time he's even more wrong than usual. There is someone violating the First Amendment on Twitter, but it's not Twitter -- it's Trump.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159070720267825876100021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N4GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"968\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We're fed up with it.\"</p><p> The president signed the order just two days after Twitter, for the first time, posted fact-checking labels on two of his tweets in which he criticized states' efforts to expand voting by mail. The labels directed users to fact-checking by media outlets such as The Washington Post and CNN, which stated that the president made an \"unsubstantiated claim\" about mail-in voting leading to widespread voter fraud.</p><p> Mr. Trump took the election-year action as he trails presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden in national polls and in polling averages of several battleground states.</p><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, called the president's order a \"desperate distraction\" from the coronavirus crisis.</p><p> \"The president's executive order does nothing to address big internet companies' complete failure to fight the spread of disinformation,\" Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement. \"Instead the president is encouraging Facebook and other social media giants to continue to exploit and profit off falsehoods with total impunity  while at the same time directing the federal government to dismantle efforts to help users distinguish fact from fiction.\"</p><p>Twitter had no immediate reaction, although CEO Jack Dorsey said earlier that his company is not trying to be an \"arbiter of truth.\"</p><p> \"Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves,\" Mr. Dorsey tweeted Wednesday night. \"More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.\"</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out Twitter for labeling Mr. Trump's tweets. He told Fox News that privately owned digital platforms should not act as the \"arbiter of truth.\"</p><p> \"Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that,\" he said.</p><p> The U.S. Chamber of Commerce took the unusual step of criticizing Mr. Trump's order soon after he signed it.</p><p> \"Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States,\" the nation's largest business group said. \"An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.\"</p><p> Mr. Barr will work with states on developing their own regulations. The attorney general said social media companies have \"stretched\" the intent of the 1990s-era law to enrich themselves and grow more powerful.</p><p> \"They are using that market power to force particular viewpoints, and that's wrong,\" Mr. Barr said. \"This will help to get back to the right balance.\"</p><p> The president has more than 80 million Twitter followers. Some Democratic and media critics say Mr. Trump is trying to create special online treatment for himself. Earlier in the day, he retweeted a video of a New Mexico supporter saying \"the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.\"</p><p> Asked why he doesn't delete his Twitter accounts, Mr. Trump replied, \"If we had fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat.\"</p><p> Ironically, Mr. Biden called this year for Section 230 to be rescinded entirely.</p><p> \"Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, No. 1,\" Mr. Biden told The New York Times editorial board in January, \"for [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg and other platforms.\"</p><p> Mr. Biden is isolated on the issue from many in his party, including Mrs. Pelosi.</p><p> The president's order also calls for the White House office of digital strategy to revive an online tool enabling people to report \"online censorship and other potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices by online platforms.\" Those complaints would be submitted to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p> The order also prohibits federal agencies from spending tax dollars on advertising with platforms that violate free speech.</p><p> \"Taxpayer dollars are not going to any social media companies that suppress free speech,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're rich enough.\"</p><p> Conservatives have long accused social media giants of political bias. They point to examples of high-profile conservatives being barred from the platforms.</p><p> Media Research Center President Brent Bozell said Twitter, Facebook and other big-tech companies \"are guilty of censoring conservatives, and their protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should be reviewed.\"</p><p> \"Both Twitter and Facebook have embraced so-called 'fact-checkers' to moderate content, and almost all of them are left-wing and use their authority to push a leftist agenda,\" Mr. Bozell said. \"This problem began as a primal scream from Silicon Valley leftists devastated over the result of the 2016 election. Now, many in Big Tech are doing everything in their power to discredit the president and derail his reelection. The right doesn't want to wreck the internet; it wants to preserve it as the open forum it was intended to be.\"</p><p> Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, said if Twitter, Google and other social media companies \"are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve-out from the federal government in Section 230.\" Mr. Hawley has introduced legislation to change the law.</p><p> But Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who co-authored Section 230 of the law, said the president's order is an effort \"to chill speech and bully companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter into giving him favorable treatment.\"</p><p> \"Donald Trump's order is plainly illegal,\" Mr. Wyden said. \"He's clearly targeting Section 230 because it protects private businesses' right not to have to play host to his lies. There is nothing in the law about political neutrality. It does not say companies like Twitter are forced to carry misinformation about voting, especially from the president. Efforts to erode Section 230 will only make online content more likely to be false and dangerous.\"</p><p> The American Civil Liberties Union said Mr. Trump is trying to engage in his own version of censorship.</p><p>ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Kate Ruane said the president \"has no authority to rewrite a congressional statute with an executive order imposing a flawed interpretation of Section 230.\"</p><p> \"Section 230 incentivizes platforms to host all sorts of content without fear of being held liable for it. It enables speech, not censorship,\" she said.</p><p> Marty Lederman, a professor at the Georgetown Law Center, called the pending executive order \"a political document, intended to rile up the base,\" tweeting that it is \"bluster w/o effect.\"</p><p> He said even if Mr. Trump orders Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to direct the FCC to come up with a proposed regulation, \"it's hard to imagine the FCC doing anything with it.\" He also predicted the independent Federal Trade Commission would ignore such a directive.</p><p> Jim Manley, a lawyer with the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, called the president's order \"completely backward\" in its approach to the First Amendment.</p><p> \"These platforms have a First Amendment right to decide what sort of content they're going to host,\" he said in an interview. \"And there may be implications under Section 230 if they make decisions about content, but the companies have a First Amendment right to decide what content they host and how they host it.\"</p><p> Mr. Trump and his advisers pointed to biased comments by Twitter executive Yoel Roth, who has tweeted about \"actual Nazis in the White House\" and referred to Mr. Trump after the 2016 election as \"a racist tangerine.\"</p><p> Mr. Dorsey responded, \"There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.

The Republican Party cannot let it happen. There's ballot harvesting. You don't think they rip them out of mailboxes? They can even print ballots.

The move immediately backfired: Experts disputed that Trump's tweet was actually misleading, in part because mail-in balloting has been linked to ongoing fraud; Twitter's fact-check itself contained false statements; and Twitter failed to apply the standard of review to other users.</p><p> At Thursday's signing ceremony, Trump called the fact-check \"egregious,\" and held up a photo of Twitter executive Yoel Roth, who heads up the site's fact-checking and rules-making operation. Fox News reported on Wednesday that Roth has mocked Trump supporters, called Trump's team \"ACTUAL NAZIS,\" slammed \"scary trannies\" in New York City, and called GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a \"bag of farts.\" (In a statement, Twitter did not dispute Fox News' reporting, but called it \"unfortunate.\")</p><p> \"My executive order calls for new regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it so that social media companies that engage in censoring any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield,\" the president said.</p><p> He added: \"My executive order further instructs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prohibit social media companies from engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce. This commerce resides in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. ... Additionally, I'm directing the attorney general to work cooperatively with the states ... to enforce their own laws against such deceptive business practices. The states have broad and powerful authority to regulate in this arena.\"</p><p> Under the CDA, platforms are ordinarily not liable for users' defamatory or otherwise problematic posts, while publishers that actively shape and create content do face liability. (Copyright law, which has a strong constitutional foundation, ordinarily does require sites like Twitter to remove offending content, or face liability.)</p><p> The CDA, which was drafted in the Internet's early stages to guard against offensive material while also encouraging an open Internet, states: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. ... No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of ... any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\"</p><p> Although the \"good faith\" standard is ambiguous, UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh has noted that some case law suggests that \"blocking material ostensibly because it's offensive but really because it's from your business rival might well be seen as being not in good faith,\" while \"blocking material that you really do think is offensive to many of your users (much like sexually themed or excessively violent or harassing material is offensive to many of your users) seems to be quite consistent with good faith.\"</p><p> Trump's order instructs the federal government to interpret and apply the CDA, as agencies typically do when laws give them that flexibility. \"It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified: the immunity should not extend beyond its text and purpose to provide protection for those who purport to provide users a forum for free and open speech, but in reality use their power over a vital means of communication to engage in deceptive or pretextual actions stifling free and open debate by censoring certain viewpoints,\" the order states.</p><p> Volokh, for his part, argued that while there could be an argument that providers act in \"bad faith\" when they remove content they don't truly find objectionable, it would be a nonstarter to argue that removing \"offensive\" content necessarily transforms a platform into a publisher.</p><p> However, Trump made his position on the matter clear. \"The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadowban are editorial decisions, pure and simple,\" Trump said. \"In those moments Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint.\"</p><p> Indeed, the executive order reads: \"It is the policy of the United States to ensure that, to the maximum extent permissible under the law, this provision is not distorted to provide liability protection for online platforms that \u2014 far from acting in 'good faith' to remove objectionable content \u2014 instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree.\"</p><p> \"Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike,\" the order adds.</p><p> The White House had discussed a social media executive order for the past several months, and lawmakers -- including GOP Sens. Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley -- have increasingly sought CDA reforms.</p><p> On Thursday, Trump pointed out that some Democrats agreed with him. Former Vice President Biden, in a January interview with The New York Times, said that Section 230 \"should be revoked, immediately should be revoked\" because Facebook \"is propagating falsehoods they know to be false, and we should be setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy.\"</p><p> Also at the signing ceremony, Trump openly said he would \"shut down\" Twitter if he could legally. He also called out Facebook's new oversight \"tribunal\" for hiring Pamela Karlan, the anti-Trump professor who testified at his impeachment hearing.</p><p> \"Finally, I'm directing my administration to develop policies and procedures to ensure taxpayer dollars are not going to any social media company that suppresses free speech,\" Trump said. They're rich enough.\"</p><p> \"What they're doing is tantamount to monopoly, to taking over the airwaves,\" Trump said. \"Can't let it happen. Or else we're not gonna have a democracy.\"</p><p> On Wednesday, however, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals handed Twitter and other tech giants an early win on the issue, finding that in the absence of state action, there can be no First Amendment violation.  The court also did not find a Sherman Antitrust Act violation, even though the plaintiffs alleged that big tech was conspiring to advance a left-wing agenda in restraint of commerce.</p><p> The president had teased the executive order Thursday morning, saying: \"This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!\"</p><p> Fox News is told that, separately, the administration is working on a commission to look at alleged anti-conservative bias among big social media platforms.</p><p> Meanwhile, Republicans were waging a broad, all-out war against what they perceive as pervasive Silicon Valley bias. Several Republican lawmakers suggested on Thursday they will soon take action against Reddit, saying the influential Internet message board systematically singled out, censored, and destroyed a once-popular pro-Trump \"subreddit,\" or subforum, known as \"r/The_Donald.\"</p><p> And, Vox reported on Wednesday that big tech billionares are fighting back against Republican efforts, in part because of Joe Biden's struggling operation. The outlet said LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, Laurene Powell Jobs, and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt were leading the charge -- sometimes upsetting Democratic operatives, who had wanted to run their own operation.</p><p> Hoffman has been a big financial backer of MotiveAI, which has been linked to spreading overtly fake news. For example, The Daily Beast reported that four Colorado-based companies \"associated with MotiveAI\" used \"50 seemingly independent Facebook pages to purchase ads in 2018\" -- including a page that suggested Brett Kavanaugh \"had helped Bill and Hillary Clinton cover up the murder of a White House aide.\"</p><p> Hoffman alone has also dumped approximately $10 million into Acronym, which backed the company Shadow -- which, in turn, was behind the disastrous Iowa caucus app.</p><p> According to Vox, Acronym hopes to secure another $25 million \"to set up seven of its own media properties in swing states, creating local news sites that portray moderate Democratic candidates in a favorable light, but appear to be objective, homespun outlets.\"</p><p> Get updates on this story at Foxnews.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-bcd98a1e53adc69751e1d3e41f6891bae836560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E113E37CC322E NWBKMI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-0YN1-JBCN-408B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 WJBK Fox 2<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Right now, we are near  session highs for the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 137 points.  What a  Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us. I'm Lauren Simonetti.  I'm in for Trish Regan and  welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  Well, President Trump shaking Capitol  Hill today threatening to veto the spending bill saying it didn't spend  enough on his border wall.  Then he said he would sign it but never  anything like it ever, ever again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As a matter of national  security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill.  There are a lot of things  that's I'm unhappy about in this bill.  There are a lot of things that we  shouldn't have had in this bill but we were, in a sense, forced if we want  to build our military.  We were forced to have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We're going to have more on that straight ahead.</p><p>And stocks, as we've noted, down sharply.  Yesterday, down in the pre- market.  Guess what?  They opened higher today but moments after President  Trump threatened to veto the omnibus bill came, the markets retreated, went  negative then they bounced back again as we learned that the President  would sign the spending bill.  It's so crazy.</p><p>We also have fears of a trade war.  They continue today as China now  threatens to retaliate after President Trump imposed about $60 billion on  tariffs on Chinese goods.  What does this mean for the world's two largest  economies?  We're on that story as well.</p><p>But first, we go to Adam Shapiro who is live at the White House with the  latest on the spending bill.  Adam the guessing game is now over?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  The guessing game is over, and you  heard the President say he did this for the sake of national security.  You  heard Defense Secretary Mattis talking about this and this is the largest  military spending in U.S. history to help rebuild the nation's military and  secure the national defense.  But the President is not pleased because, as  he said as he was leaving the diplomatic room at the White House, that he  very seriously considered a veto because while the administration got some  of what it wanted, this didn't fix DACA and he had a message to Hispanic- Americans saying, \"Republicans are working in your interest better than  Democrats.\"  He was very upset with this.</p><p>And as you have -- in the introduction, the sound bite in which he said he  would never sign a bill like this again, one way to avoid that, he said,  would be to revoke the filibuster the Senate has.  Here is the President in  his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm  calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending  bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get  down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Now, political analysts have said, one, even if they had the  filibuster removed from the Senate, they were missing John McCain.  So the  Republicans would not have had the majority that the President thinks that  he might have been able to get.</p><p>The other issue, of course, was to DACA.  The President wanted a fix that  would have allowed the DACA students, roughly 800,000 people, to have 2.5  year extension in exchange for the Democrats fully funding the border wall  with Mexico $25 billion.  The Democrats wanted a permanent fix for the DACA  students and other aliens who have come to the United States illegally and  the President wouldn't do that because he wanted full funding for the  border wall.</p><p>Here is what the President said about that situation in the negotiations of  the omnibus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats.   We wanted to include DACA.  We wanted to have them in this bill.  Eight  hundred thousand people.  And actually it could even be more.</p><p>And we wanted to include DACA in this bill.  The Democrats would not do it.   They would not do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So Lauren, the President, although he doesn't say he got some of  what the administration wanted in the bill, the biggest thing was  rebuilding the U.S. Military.  And as you heard at the beginning of the  2:00 hour, the President signed this bill, this $1.3 trillion bill, which  he called ridiculous.  He signed it for the sake of national security.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And the defense stocks certainly appreciating that today.  They  are up sharply.  Adam, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Joining me now is the American Majority CEO, Ned  Ryun, to talk about everything we just heard and everything that's gotten  down the past 24 hours or so.  Right now, we have averted a government  shutdown.  The question is, is that bad for Republicans because basically  we control the White House and Congress as Republicans, and we just -- you  had the President sign the second biggest spending bill ever, would a veto,  Ned, have been worse?  A government shutdown?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  I actually think Trump was morally  obligated to veto this omnibus bill.  Let's not forget, Congress could have  passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government open.  This omnibus  is a big government dream come true, and Trump, you know, two weeks ago,  the President should have engaged more heavily.</p><p>The second best time was now veto the bill and start negotiating for a  better deal on just a wide variety of fronts.  I mean take away the names  of those people that sign this, Republican Congress and the Republican  President.  This seems like we just went back to the future where this  could be done by Obama and the Democrat Congress signing a $1.3 trillion  bill to take our national debt to $22 trillion.  It's hard to keep track of  what our national debt is.</p><p>And the amazing thing to me in all of this, Lauren, is the facts that there  was very little that Trump actually got.  I know, he wants to promote the  national security and the spending on the military, when it really comes  down to it, the new funding for new wall is really just for about 33 feet  of new wall.  This is one of the biggest issues that he was elected on.   And out of $1.3 trillion bill, we couldn't find $21billion to $25 billion  to build the southern wall.</p><p>And the thing is, the social concern that I'm also deeply disappointed  about in this omnibus, there's still over half a billion in annual funding  for Planned Parenthood.  I see very little to be happy about in this.  And  when it comes down to the military spending, Lauren, if he had vetoed this  bill and forced them to actually negotiate and challenge them and dared  them to not fund the military, he would have won that bet.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Well, Ned, stay here.  I also want to bring in the  American University Scholar, Capri Cafaro joining us now.  </p><p>Good to see you, Capri.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOLAR:  Absolutely, anytime.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I want to talk to you about something that Senator Bob Corker  tweeted.  I love the tweet.  He said, \"Please do, Mr. President,\" meaning  veto this bill.  \"I'm just down the street and will bring you the pen.  The  spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our  children under the bus.  Totally irresponsible.\"</p><p>Are we now having the President just sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill?   Are we mortgaging millennials' futures?  Are we killing our kids and  grandkids?</p><p>CAFARO:  Well, I mean, any time that you actually, you know, spend without  offset, certainly, I mean, we're continuing to increase the deficit and  debt.  And I do think it's interesting, you know, Bob Corker and Rand Paul  and many other, you know, stalwart Conservatives there, deficit hawks,  certainly, are not excited about a $1.3 trillion spending bill, regardless  what's in it.  And so, I think, that this is a fundamental discussion  amongst the nuances and the branches of the Republican Party.</p><p>Donald Trump has never been an ideological purist, and whether it is, you  know, his issues with trade and tariffs or, you know, these kind of things.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>CAFARO:  I mean, he basically said, \"I might veto this bill because, number  one, it doesn't have more spending and, number two, per the DACA  recipients.  So, you know, if you are a Freedom Caucus guy, you scratch  your head.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's all about the negotiation, Ned.  He's all about the art of  the deal and the compromise.  So he basically said as I saw it, Ned, \"I'll  give you what you want on DACA.  You give me what I want on my wall.\"  But  neither seemed happen?</p><p>RYUN:  No, neither seemed happen.  This is why I'm a little perplexed as to  how this all went down when neither party walked away with what they  wanted.</p><p>Lauren, Trump ran on, I am going to come to Washington.  It will not be  business as usual.  I will drain the swamp.  We will shake up D.C.</p><p>What we saw today is business as usual.  The swamp on the rise.  We did not  see anything that he ran on in 2016.  And people like me were voting for an  outside the box candidate, and what you saw today with him signing this  bill.</p><p>And, again, Democrats didn't get DACA.  He didn't get his wall.  We got  $1.3 trillion.  The taxpayers got saddled with $1.3 trillion extra in  spending.  I'm perplexed as to what we actually voted for in 2016, because  right now what we're seeing is nothing what we expected on that campaign  just a year and a half ago.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And, you know, I'll give you the final answer here,  Capri.  I asked Ned this question earlier, should the President just have  let the government shutdown over this?</p><p>CAFARO:  I don't think so.  I think that that would have been  irresponsible.  You know, they're on recess.</p><p>I think it's important that, you know, you move the ball forward, and I  think he actually framed this very well actually for the 2018 midterms.  He  tried to blame Democrats for overspending and he sent a very strong message  to Washington, to Congress saying, \"We want a certain number of kind of  procedural reforms.\"  So I think he's setting the stage saying, \"Never  again.  I'm going let this go, and if you don't do XYZ, there is a going to  be wrath.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You've been warned.  All right.  Capri, Ned, thank you to both  of you.  Have a good weekend.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks Laura.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Let's turn back to the chaotic markets.  Right now,  stocks are higher.  Paring gains, we did hit session highs on President  Trump's decision to sign the $1.3 trillion spending bill in order to fund  the military the way they need and to keep the government open.  Right now,  Dow industrials up 74 points.  The week has been terrible.</p><p>Let's bring in Vision 4 Fund Distributors Vice President, Heather  Zumarraga, along Tematica Research CIO, Chris Versace.  </p><p>Good to see you, Heather and Chris.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VICE PRESIDENT, VISION 4 FUND DISTRIBUTORS:  Hi.</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, CIO, TEMATICA RESEARCH CIO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You know, they say it's been a chaotic few days for the  markets.  Heather, let me ask you first.  What do you think investors are  responding to most, the fact we are keeping national debt at astronomical  levels and only growing it or growing trade war?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I think a growing trade war.  Investors are responding to that  more.  I know that we're rallying on the backs of the announcement that  President Trump is not going to veto the spending bill, Lauren.  But I  think trade is still a wild card in the markets right now.</p><p>We really don't know the details of final legislation, and so how will that  impact the industrials, the materials, the metals, even technology.  I  think that we'll still weigh on investors' minds and there's more downside  to come.  But the fundamentals are still in place, earnings are up,  inflation remains low and unemployment is low.  So, that's great.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Chris, we had a lot of guests on the show yesterday when the  market was down 724 points at the end of the day, and they were kind of  saying, yes, this is no big deal, this is all part of the negotiation of  the President.  We think when you take a scalpel to these tariffs, we're  going to exempt the right people and everybody can just breathe a sigh of  relief.  And in a sense, they were right today, and I point out Boeing  shares.  Boeing is responsible for most of the Dow's climb.  Is that  signaling to you that everything might be OK in the end as we're gambling  with U.S. versus China versus the rest of the world?</p><p>VERSACE:  Yes, I think what you're seeing is usual stock market, you know,  shoot first, ask questions later.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>VERSACE:  You know, when you look at the data that we're getting, we saw  the March Flash PMI come out, you know, signaling an improvement in the  economy.  I think the big issue that people are getting caught up in is,  you know, demand is improving but the question is, what's the cost  structure going to be?  And I think, that's what getting people a little  nervous.  You know, if we do see these tariffs going into effect,  obviously, steel, aluminum will move higher.  If the response into effect,  other costs could move higher as well.</p><p>And remember, we're getting ready for the March-quarter earnings season  where the markets predicated on 18 percent to 20 percent EPS bump for the  S&amp;P 500 this year.  If that story starts to come undone a little bit, it  likely means the market will give some ground back.  So I think what you're  seeing now is the market getting prepared for that potential conversation,  but there are still strong well-positioned companies out there.  Perhaps we  can buy them now at even better prices.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, Heather, should we buy more domestic companies.  Fewer  multinationals.  And I say that because, what, Nike gets 15 percent of its  revenue from China, right?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Starbucks, about the same percentage from China.  And if we  have a different relationship with China, maybe our big companies need to  rethink their strategy in order to keep their earnings strong?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, you're right.  Over the short term, I think you can look  at smaller cap companies based in the U.S., Russell 2000 is a good gauge of  small cap companies, that aren't heavily impacted of potential trade wars  or China retaliation of our tariffs.  And so these global multinational  companies would be impacted the most.</p><p>I just don't think it makes sense right now to place a bet on a direction  long or short on a global multinational when we don't have the final  details.  Go to Vegas.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We don't know.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, you'd be better off. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, that's an excellent point.  And, Chris, maybe you can help  explain to me how tariffs on, let's say, solar panels, washing machines and  steel deal with the Chinese theft of our trade secrets, our technology, our  intellectual property?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  They do.</p><p>VERSACE:  I would like to be able to say that but I know the answer to  that, but those are two are very different things.  I mean, you know, when  we talk about, you know, the tariffs in a way to help support our national  security and prevent issues from happening, I think, a lot of people can  get behind that.  I think when we talk about washing machines, solar panels  and the other things where we're going to see costs driven up, I think  people, they get caught in the crosshairs a little bit understanding that  we want to buy American but we also have economy that's predicated on cash  strapped consumers trying to spend and spend more, which means we need  cheaper alternatives.  Hence, some of these goods coming in that we've been  relying upon from China.</p><p>So, it's an interesting Catch-22, but I think the long-term question is if  we can get our capacity in the U.S. up to meet demands, get better pricing,  then we can get better paying jobs in the U.S. and help continue the  rebound in the economy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Heather, you talked about this earlier, and I'm not going to --  I agree with you.  Employment situation is looking better, corporate  earnings are strong, the economic data has been good.  But when you look at  numbers, last year GDP in the U.S. averaged 2.3 percent.  Guess what it  averaged in China?  Six point nine percent.  They transitioned from a made- in-China economy to a made-for-China economy, and we need to stop that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, they're still trying transition to consumption economy in  China.  And, look, the data that comes out of China in terms of GDP, I  never really -- you don't know if you can trust the data that's coming out  of China.  They always seem to meet or beat their GDP forecast.  So, it's  always looking rosy over in China.</p><p>But, look, they need us as much as we need them.  We import about $500  billion of stuff from them every year, and although there is a massive  trade deficit, we don't want to hurt China.  In the end, we just want more,  fair playing field, and that's what we're going after.  I'm just not sure  tariffs are the best way to do it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And arguably, who needs who more than the other?  Heather,  Chris, I guess, we don't have all the answers today.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  You got it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Have a great weekend.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  You, too.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, President Trump is signing the massive spending bill  today saying he'll do it for national security.  This, as he names former  U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton as his next National Security  Adviser.  Ambassador Bolton is a foreign policy hawk when it comes to  issues like Iran and North Korea.  So how is all of this going to play out  on the world stage?  We're going to discuss that with Retired Four-star  General Jack Keane, in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Final day of a tough week at the office.  We've got less than  two hours left and the markets are all in the negative.  The Dow is down  two points.  If we're lower today, we're -- this will be the third day of  losses in a row and pretty significant losses at that.  S&amp;P is down 11  points and the NASDAQ selling off the most here on percentage terms by  almost three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>Just moments ago, the President invokes national security in his reason for  signing the $1.3 trillion spending bill vowing that our military will be  the strongest ever, defense stocks rallying on this.</p><p>He also tapped Former Ambassador and Fox News Contributor, John Bolton, as  his new and third National Security Adviser.  Bolton was known for having  hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea.  And earlier today, he told  Stuart Varney this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  I think my view is the  same as the President's, which he's described as the worst deal in American  diplomatic history.  The issue for any deal like this is are you really  solving the problem or you just simply making people feel good while a  country like Iran violates its commitments?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The President had kind words for his Outgoing National Security  Adviser, H.R. McMaster tweeting, I'm very thankful for the service of  General McMaster who has done an outstanding job and will always remain my  friend.</p><p>Joining me now, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.   What do you make of all this, General?</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Well, I think  what's the hardest thing about government and particularly Executive  branches everybody starts a job that they've never had before on the same  day.  And now the President's a year plus into his job, and I think he  understands the presidency now, he understands his role.  He knows what  he's bringing to the table.  What strengths and weaknesses.  And he kind of  knows what he wants from the staff and also from his Cabinet officials,  that's why he's making these changes, because --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So it seems like --</p><p>KEANE:  -- he knows what he wants.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It seems like chaos in the White House is really just growing  pains and now he's got the team in place that he wants.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, pretty much.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.</p><p>KEANE:  I don't think he's finished yet, but it is pretty -- and I think  when you look at, you know, Mike Pompeo over at State and --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  -- and Kudlow in as Economic Adviser and John Bolton, all three of  these people I know and have great respect for them, they're going fit  right like a hand in a glove with what the President is thinking.  They  won't agree with him on everything and I don't think the President  necessarily wants that.  But he clearly wants someone who is going to get  right behind his agenda and support it.</p><p>And, you know, if you spend so much time around these people, you kind of  want to like them as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, let's talk about John Bolton.  Because he is known as  being a military action type of guy, definitely hawkish when it comes to  foreign policy.  He'll start officially in April, which is interesting  because in May, the President is expected to decide the fate of the Iran  nuclear deal and he's also expected to meet with the leader of North Korea.   How do you think John Bolton will affect any of those decisions and  meetings?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, Bolton agrees with the President's national  security strategy.  We're turning to a big power competition, again, with  Russia, China, Iran, rogue state like North Korea who was nuclearizing  ICBM's and is threatening the American people.  So Bolton's approach to  that, as is the President's approach, is to stand up to it not to confront  it.  All those countries we're talking about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.</p><p>KEANE:  Not to appease these countries as the previous administration has  done, which has weakened the relationship that our allies have with each  other and also with us and is emboldened our adversaries.  So, if you want  the diplomatic situation to work effectively, our adversary has to know  that we're at least willing to use a military option if it's necessary and  that's what the President has been trying to convince Kim Jong-un of for a  year plus now.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm imposing economic sanctions on you, but I'm also wanting to use a  military option if those sanctions fail.\"  And I think Bolton will come in  and reinforce that very solidly along with the rest of the national  security team.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  He just -- in the end of February, wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall  Street Journal\" basically saying talking doesn't work.  The title of this  article was \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\"  So we know  who's in charge here and what we're playing with.</p><p>The other issue, and this is something Mr. Bolton certainly knows, is that  North Korea often makes you think they're willing to negotiate when really  they're just trying to buy themselves time to further develop or hide their  weapons.</p><p>KEANE:  Well, that certainly has been the pattern for 25 years.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  In other words, the goal with the negotiations, they buy some time,  they advance their technology and they get concessions.  We don't know for  sure whether these negotiations are sincere or they're phony like the  others.  But we're going to find out here pretty quick.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And what about Russia?  It seems like Mr. Bolton and the  President have different -- Trump has been criticized for appeasing or  overlooking some of the things that Russia does.  And it seems Mr. Bolton  would have a more hard line on Russia?</p><p>KEANE:  I think so.  Most of us take a harder line dealing with Russia than  the President has on all of these issues.  And now, he has stood up to  Russia to be sure.  He is providing lethal aid to the Ukrainian, something  the previous administration never did.</p><p>He struck Assad's air power 36 hours after they used chemical weapons, and  those chemical weapons had passive approval of the Russians in doing that,  you know, who is a client state of Russia.  And clearly we're now  sanctioning Russia.  But I agree, I think what the President is in his head  with this thing, I think, it's a mistake to think he is soft on Russia,  because I don't buy that.</p><p>I think what he believes himself is that -- he's itching to get into the  room with Putin.  And the reason for that is he knows that Putin has  manipulated his three predecessors quite successfully.  And I think he  believes, \"You know, I've dealt with people like this before, I know where  he's coming from.  I know he's a thug and a bully, but I'm not going to say  that in public because I don't want to forfeit my ability to have a real  conversation with this guy.\"  I think that's where the President's head  really is.  And we'll see.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well said, General Keane.  Thank you very much.</p><p>KEANE:  OK.  Good talking to you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>All right.  Let's take a look at this market before we all head out for the  weekend.  You can see down across the board here, S&amp;P is down half of one  percent.  NASDAQ is down three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>We're going live to the New York Stock Exchange next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And while the Dow is below 24,000, stocks turning negative amid  a very choppy session as investors weigh the impact of Congress' trillion  plus dollar spending bill and also a looming trade war with China.  We go  to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange for a rundown of the  chaotic action today.</p><p>Nicole, how are you?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Right, Lauren.  Just to name a few  of the items here front and center on Wall Street with every headline that  comes our way, the Dow is down about a thousand points this week and  yesterday's close of more than 700 points to the downside.  It was about  100 points off of that low in early February.  The hope is not to take out  that low and, in fact, try and keep that as a support level.</p><p>Looking at the Dow right now down 11 points had been down 124 points, up  just about 50.  So we're watching to see where we end.  But for the week  the Dow and the S&amp;P are down about four percent, the NASDAQ down five  percent.  Defense stocks though bucking the trend.</p><p>We've had so much news, of course, Bolton now the National Security  Adviser.  He's hawkish.  The idea that he's going to be spending on our  national security, you can see Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman up about  four percent each.  This group as a group in aerospace and defense group is  seeing it the best day jumping since President Trump was elected to be our  President in November of 2016.</p><p>And a quick look at the big tech IPO of the day.  That's Dropbox in the  Cloud-based file storage area.  Look at this, up 40 percent.  This is the  largest IPO since Snap, Lauren, and it certainly saw the demand even though  that IPO price was raised, it's still jumping.  It seems everybody is  trying to get in on this particular tech stock, and it's a winner today.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Big tech is struggling, Nicole.  And this is, you know,  they call them the unicorns.  Maybe this is the next thing.  We'll see.   Nicole, thank you.</p><p>Well, China is certainly firing back today.  They are threatening  retaliatory tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, this, after  President Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods.  So are we headed  for an all-out trade war?  How bad does it get?  We've got the intel next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, ISIS claiming responsibility for today's hostage  situation in France.  National police there say, at least, three people  were killed and a dozen wounded in what is being described as a terrorist  attack.  The armed gunman, who was shot and killed by police, demanding the  release of one of the Paris attackers from the 2015 Bataclan massacre.</p><p>And video surfacing, and this is hard to watch, of the fatal pedestrian  crash that involved self-driving Uber car.  Well, the 22-second clip shows  a woman walking from a dark area onto the street with her bicycle before  the SUV hits her.  Experts say the vehicle sensors should have spotted her.   Her name was Elaine Herzberg.  She was 49 years old.</p><p>But the video also shows the driver was distracted.  He's called a minder.   He's just operating the self-driving car.  We're also learning he was a  convicted felon.</p><p>And the parents out there, Toys \"R\" Us officially kicking off the going out  of business sale today.  All 735 stores, including Babies \"R\" Us, the  company is not saying how big the discounts will be and obviously there are  no returns here.  Customers will be able to use their gift cards until  April 21st.  But that is the death of an iconic store.</p><p>All right.  Back to the main story today.  China threatening to impose its  own reciprocal tariffs on American goods just one day after President Trump  announced plans to slap steep tariffs on Chinese goods.  Stoking fears that  this might be the beginning of an all-out trade war.  All of this as the  President's broad-based steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in today.  And  the President's demand a pretty simple, he wants free and fair trade with  China.</p><p>Here he is speaking just moments ago at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  China is going to end up treating us fairly.  For many years, they  had free reign, they don't have free reign anymore.  We're very friendly  with China.  We have great relationships with China.  And, look, it's time.   It's time.</p><p>Last year, we lost $500 billion on trade with China.  We can't let that  happen.  And thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Joining me now is Manhattan Institute Senior  Fellow, Steven Malanga.  Good to see you, Steve.</p><p>STEVEN MALANGA, MANHATTAN SENIOR INSTITUTE FELLOW:  Hi.  How are you?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, no matter what number you use, $375 billion, $504 billion  most of our global trade deficit at $800 is with China.</p><p>MALANGA:  Yes.  So--</p><p>SIMONETTI:  How do you fix this?</p><p>MALANGA:  -- all the lost is strange here.  Well, look I think that even  most free traders will tell you that there's imbalance because China  cheats.  China has -- our agreements with them are, in a sense, unfair.   They demand technology from our companies --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MALANGA:  -- in order for some companies to go over this, we have to move  jobs over there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Set up a joint venture with them.  You can't own more than 49  percent of their companies.</p><p>MALANGA:  They ban of our countries' companies.  Facebook can't operate  there.  Of course after the data breach, I doubt they will.  They don't  have to forget about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We'll talk about that later.</p><p>MALANGA:  Right.  So there's no doubt.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right.</p><p>MALANGA:  But the real question that people have is whether Trump has an  actual strategy here, a coherent strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Does he?</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, it's inconsistent.  First of all, this is an administration  that back in 2017 was saying -- Wilbur Ross, for instance, was saying that  we're not going to have to be punitive.  We're going to negotiate with  China, and they're already on board with this.</p><p>The President himself who called China a currency manipulator during his  campaign, he's not declared China a manipulator.  Now all of a sudden,  we're being punitive and it seems it come out of nowhere and even the  Chinese are a little bit confused.  So, people are kind of wondering what's  going on and whether he has a strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And it seems like the tariffs so far on steel and aluminum, on  the washing machines, it seems like they're not addressing the problem.   The main problem is China's theft of our intellectual property.</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, that's exactly right.  Again, there's the sense.  First of  all, people don't know whether when he basically said, \"OK, look, we're  going to slap the tariffs on.\"  And then he pulled them back on Canada and  Mexico, whether they had actually planned that or whether they just said,  \"oops!\" you know, now our trading partners are getting upset with us.</p><p>But the real question, I'll give you an example, OK.  Trump, one of the  ways that you want to increase an imbalance like this is basically to  create more opportunities for American companies.</p><p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership was going to be an opportunity.  It wasn't a  well-negotiated trade deal, OK?  But there was a chance to make that better  and to create opportunities with Asian trading partners in opposition for  China.  Instead Trump just said, \"We're going to abandon it, we're done  with it.\"  That, you see --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Do you think we get back into it on different terms?</p><p>MALANGA:  -- yes, definitely on different terms, but thing is you had a  framework, you had a negotiation, go forward with that.  So, listen, it's  not adequate enough, we're still on the losing end with you folks but we  all need to be united against China.  But that's not what the President  did.  So, that's where he's sending mixed messages.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Do you think we're starting to align as we do, you know, team  Washington versus team Beijing here?  You see these tariffs with many  exemptions.  The E.U and six other countries, one of them being South  Korea, they're exempt from some of these tariffs.  But let me ask you this,  South Korea is exempt, most of Europe is exempt, those markets tanked  today?</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, the interesting thing is, you know, on the list of  potential currency manipulators are South Korea, Japan, Germany, and  European Union.  So they're grouped in there with China, OK.  There's no --  we have imbalances, OK?</p><p>We have with other countries too, where we essentially allow them more  access to our markets than they allow us to their markets.  Trump is right  to focus on that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But the point is  whether a trade war in which he seems to be picking his targets and then  pulling back, he's sending mixed messages to people rather than getting out  and then create more -- demanding more opportunity for American companies  overseas.  That's absolutely a strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Does all of this create American jobs in the end or does it  just hurt the American work of vis-a-vis higher consumer prices?</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, here is the thing, one of the ironies of this right now is  that we have almost record low unemployment.  Usually you start trade wars.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And we're down 3.6 percent --</p><p>MALANGA:  Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- according to the Fed.</p><p>MALANGA:  And here is the thing, right, if you walk right now, OK --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MALANGA:  -- have companies who can't find enough workers, right, because  they have opportunities and we don't have people trained for that.  If you  really wanted to move forward with opportunity right now, the one thing you  would be looking, actually, is getting people better trained to take those  jobs that are open in our own marketplace right now.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Steve, good to see you.  Thank you very much.  All  right.</p><p>Let's see if Steve moved the markets, because they've been all over the  place today.  Every body has moved on.  Dow is down 43 points at 23,917.</p><p>The other markets are lower as well.  All of this as Dropbox, we were a  little bit nervous about this this morning when the futures were tanking  200.  They made their debut on the NASDAQ.  We're going to have more on all  of this in just a bit.</p><p>Look at Dropbox shares rallying 40 percent on day one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Take a look at shares of Dropbox, surging on their first day of  trading.  The company launching its IPO amid a firestorm of economic news.   Currently wreaking havoc in Washington and on Wall Street.  Look at that,  Dropbox priced at 21.  Opened we get 29, it's at 29.46 a pop now.</p><p>Let's go to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where Virtu Financial  trader, Matt Cheslock, joins us now.</p><p>All right.  So, you know, Dropbox not trading where you are, it's at the  NASDAQ, but it's a unicorn, right?  It's a start-up.  It has a billion  dollars in revenue right now.  Valued at about $8, $9 billion.</p><p>Pales in comparison to somebody's huge big textile, all are Amazon and  Netflix, and Alphabet.  They're not holding up so well as we get all the  big tech company.  But investors are still optimistic on tech?</p><p>MATT CHESLOCK, VIRTU FINANCIAL TRADER:  Yes, you know what?  I mean this  was a good barometer for what the market was looking for.  So, maybe you  have the sell-off in the tech sector, maybe they were raising money to buy  Dropbox.  I mean, it was 25 times oversubscribed, right?  So, it had a  tremendous day that despite the market closing down 700 yesterday.</p><p>There had to be worries last night going in to price on that deal, but they  came out through and smelled like roses here.  So, you know, all good from  there.  And, you know, just an example of, you know, what there is on the  tech side.  You know, there are so many of these unicorns that are waiting  to see some money and go public to get the investors involved.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You know, we're looking at the Dow and it is now down in triple  digits once again.  We're not seeing a recovery.  Of course, anything can  happen in this final hour and 10 minutes here.  But we're riding 724-point  sell-off yesterday.  What gives?</p><p>CHESLOCK:  You know what?  I would've rather seen a sharp sell-off this  morning and have us recover throughout the day.  Instead we tried to open  higher and it failed.  We tried multiple times during the day.</p><p>Whatever we can take out of Washington as a positive, you know, the  spending bill that should have been a foregone conclusion, it wasn't even  talked about yesterday.  The only fact that really was mentioned today was  because it was almost got vetoed.  So, other than that, you know, there  hasn't been all lot out there.  It's good stock specific.</p><p>You know, company like Nike and company like Boeing today, you know,  they're performing pretty well outside of the Dropbox.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Boeing is, well, they are --</p><p>CHESLOKCK:  Good work.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- a positive contribution today.  Does that make you feel --  because Boeing is such a multinational, Asia and China are such a big part  of its business, does that encourage you that maybe this trade war won't  get so bad the way Boeing is performing?</p><p>CHESLOCK:  Yes, you know, the fact they weren't mentioned in this first  round of the $3 billion, you know, tit-for-tat here.  So, you know, but  eventually that's going to be leveraged.  Once you start to bring in Boeing  specifically, that may start bringing the U.S at the table a little bit  quicker and maybe we have some real dialogue and we can get down to this.</p><p>We all know that the U.S. doesn't benefit from a trade war but we also  don't benefit anyway from the trade right now.  So, we need to get on equal  footing or somewhat equal footing, so this negotiation is a long way from  over but, you know, at least now we have a starting point.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Matt, thank you very much.</p><p>CHESLOCK:  Sure.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Breaking today, Congress has formally asked  Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify about the company's misuse of  your data.  And shares of Facebook are lower today.  Killed on the week.</p><p>Double digit percentage declines as the Delete Facebook movement gains  steam.  Is this the end for Facebook?  Are you going to delete your  Facebook page?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let's take a look at the sell-off on Wall Street.  Dow is down  113 points as we head into the final hour of trading.  Financials getting  killed the most today.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress has formally asked CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, to  testify about what the company is doing to protect user data and privacy.   This, after it was revealed that the data firm Cambridge Analytica may have  improperly gain access to data of million, 50 million Facebook users.</p><p>Joining me now, our very own, Deirdre Bolton, along with Founder of  Disruptive Tech Research, Lou Basenese.</p><p>Deirdre, do you think people are really going to delete Facebook?  We know  that Elon Musk has.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  I was just going to say, if you want  to one person, Elon Musk, he actually was kind of funny about it.  I swear  that he got nothing, he was like, oh, yes, I didn't even realize that  SpaceX or Tesla had their own pages, 2.5 million --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  On each.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- on each.  So, and they said, oh, yes, this looks kind of lame.   I'll just have to delete it anyway.  So, yes, basically 5 million gone --  users gone from Facebook.  So he is keeping his Instagram account, I guess  he should underline that, and as we know Facebook owns Instagram.  But, he  says that he doesn't feel that Facebook's influence is creeping in, those  are his words, not mine, into the Instagram account as much for which he  has about 7 million followers.</p><p>But, I do think this underlines -- this is the real business risk for  Facebook is that OK, this is kind of funny, it's Elon Musk, it's one person  but he has Tesla, he has SpaceX, he's widely followed as an entrepreneur.   And just the idea that maybe Facebook becomes less cool, less usable and  this Delete Facebook has actually gained some traction.</p><p>On the other side, it has more than 2 billion users.  A lot of people use  it, a lot of even older people to see pictures of grandkids, people who  have family members overseas.  So, it doesn't go away so easily either.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Even to date, Lou, if you're on tinder and you most likely need  a Facebook account, they kind of go hand-in-hand.  It's so ingrained in our  society.</p><p>LOUIS BASENESE, FOUNDER; DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Yes, it is.  I think  Facebook widely recognized long ago that they needed to have their  tentacles into our lives across multiple platforms.  And like Deirdre said,  there's Instagram, there's Facebook Messenger.  They found ways to make it  much harder to delete Facebook.</p><p>And, you know, I would tell you, I think the biggest risk here, the Delete  Facebook movement is definitely a risk, but the biggest risk here comes  from advertisers.  If they protest and bail en masse, then the business  falls apart.  And, you know, I think that's a low probability, ironically  because Facebook's data on its users is so good and its scale is so big,  over 2 billion users, advertisers aren't going to give up that marketing  channel.</p><p>So, you know, look, I think we said this earlier in the week, Lauren, this,  too, shall pass for Facebook, but this nightmare is far from over.  There's  going to be a lot of questions to be answered in uncomfortable situations  for the CEO.</p><p>BOLTON:  Indeed, and it's also a business problem as we've talked about,  too, in the sense that Facebook has to decide are we actually going to  spend more money to get human engineers who cost money, who want vacations,  who want personal time?  But they probably need to hire a lot of people to  make sure that these data infractions aren't repeated.</p><p>I want a message as well or let you know about this message that we got  from Cambridge Analytica.  The acting CEO says the data that had been  obtained from Facebook was in line with Facebook's term of service and data  protection laws.  So that's a pretty -- and basically, Cambridge Analytica  is saying, hey, listen, we didn't do anything wrong.  We were following the  map, if you like, that Facebook set out.</p><p>BASENESE:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So that's going to be one of the conversations that's continued,  to your point Lou, in D.C. and Mark Zuckerberg, is going to have to, I  mean, the New York A.G. has started an investigation, the Massachusetts  A.G., has started an investigation.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BOLTON:  Senators Thune, Nelson, saying, listen, Mark Zuckerberg, you need  to come here to D.C., you need to tell us --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And overseas there are investigations resume --</p><p>BOLTON:  -- the U.K.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Dow just fell about 200 points.  And typically, Lou, we've  seen the big tech companies, the so-called fang stocks recovered pretty  quickly when there's a big sell-off.  We're not seeing that this time  around.  What do you make of that?</p><p>BASENESE:  I'm not too concern of that, I think this is the trickle-down  effects from the regulatory threats that are facing Facebook, right?   You've already had some Congress representatives calling in potentially  other CEOs from tech companies to talk about regulating their data.  I  mean, this is just turning into a short-term debacle for Facebook, and it's  spilling over into the larger tech stocks.</p><p>I think if you want to look for protection, you've got to go somewhere into  the small and micro cap land that are largely insulated from all of this.   But right now, the headline of the day is going to be the breach of user  trust and, you know, there's an old ancient Jewish scholar that once said,  be careful, your sins will find you out.  And Facebook is learning that the  hard way right now.  Like Cambridge, Deirdre just share, the Cambridge CEO  has pointing their finger at Facebook saying, hey, we didn't do anything  wrong, you're the one that originally sent here gave us access to the user  data.  And it's going to be really hard to restore trust when users know  that that was given so freely.</p><p>SIMONETTI: One story that just is not going away because it implicates  regulation and other companies as well.  Lou, Deirdre, thank you so much  for your perspective today.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And that is it for me, but you can watch me every weekday, 5  a.m. Eastern on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now, Ashley Webster is in for Liz Claman.  And Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Here we go again.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Lock and load.</p><p>WEBSTER:  TGIF.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  There you go.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But we had a big sell-off and here we are an hour to go before  the bell rings that brings to the end, a very ugly week.  Lauren Simonetti,  thank you very much.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Right now, we are near  session highs for the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 137 points.  What a  Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us. I'm Lauren Simonetti.  I'm in for Trish Regan and  welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  Well, President Trump shaking Capitol  Hill today threatening to veto the spending bill saying it didn't spend  enough on his border wall.  Then he said he would sign it but never  anything like it ever, ever again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As a matter of national  security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill.  There are a lot of things  that's I'm unhappy about in this bill.  There are a lot of things that we  shouldn't have had in this bill but we were, in a sense, forced if we want  to build our military.  We were forced to have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We're going to have more on that straight ahead.</p><p>And stocks, as we've noted, down sharply.  Yesterday, down in the pre- market.  Guess what?  They opened higher today but moments after President  Trump threatened to veto the omnibus bill came, the markets retreated, went  negative then they bounced back again as we learned that the President  would sign the spending bill.  It's so crazy.</p><p>We also have fears of a trade war.  They continue today as China now  threatens to retaliate after President Trump imposed about $60 billion on  tariffs on Chinese goods.  What does this mean for the world's two largest  economies?  We're on that story as well.</p><p>But first, we go to Adam Shapiro who is live at the White House with the  latest on the spending bill.  Adam the guessing game is now over?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  The guessing game is over, and you  heard the President say he did this for the sake of national security.  You  heard Defense Secretary Mattis talking about this and this is the largest  military spending in U.S. history to help rebuild the nation's military and  secure the national defense.  But the President is not pleased because, as  he said as he was leaving the diplomatic room at the White House, that he  very seriously considered a veto because while the administration got some  of what it wanted, this didn't fix DACA and he had a message to Hispanic- Americans saying, \"Republicans are working in your interest better than  Democrats.\"  He was very upset with this.</p><p>And as you have -- in the introduction, the sound bite in which he said he  would never sign a bill like this again, one way to avoid that, he said,  would be to revoke the filibuster the Senate has.  Here is the President in  his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm  calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending  bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get  down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Now, political analysts have said, one, even if they had the  filibuster removed from the Senate, they were missing John McCain.  So the  Republicans would not have had the majority that the President thinks that  he might have been able to get.</p><p>The other issue, of course, was to DACA.  The President wanted a fix that  would have allowed the DACA students, roughly 800,000 people, to have 2.5  year extension in exchange for the Democrats fully funding the border wall  with Mexico $25 billion.  The Democrats wanted a permanent fix for the DACA  students and other aliens who have come to the United States illegally and  the President wouldn't do that because he wanted full funding for the  border wall.</p><p>Here is what the President said about that situation in the negotiations of  the omnibus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats.   We wanted to include DACA.  We wanted to have them in this bill.  Eight  hundred thousand people.  And actually it could even be more.</p><p>And we wanted to include DACA in this bill.  The Democrats would not do it.   They would not do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So Lauren, the President, although he doesn't say he got some of  what the administration wanted in the bill, the biggest thing was  rebuilding the U.S. Military.  And as you heard at the beginning of the  2:00 hour, the President signed this bill, this $1.3 trillion bill, which  he called ridiculous.  He signed it for the sake of national security.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And the defense stocks certainly appreciating that today.  They  are up sharply.  Adam, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Joining me now is the American Majority CEO, Ned  Ryun, to talk about everything we just heard and everything that's gotten  down the past 24 hours or so.  Right now, we have averted a government  shutdown.  The question is, is that bad for Republicans because basically  we control the White House and Congress as Republicans, and we just -- you  had the President sign the second biggest spending bill ever, would a veto,  Ned, have been worse?  A government shutdown?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  I actually think Trump was morally  obligated to veto this omnibus bill.  Let's not forget, Congress could have  passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government open.  This omnibus  is a big government dream come true, and Trump, you know, two weeks ago,  the President should have engaged more heavily.</p><p>The second best time was now veto the bill and start negotiating for a  better deal on just a wide variety of fronts.  I mean take away the names  of those people that sign this, Republican Congress and the Republican  President.  This seems like we just went back to the future where this  could be done by Obama and the Democrat Congress signing a $1.3 trillion  bill to take our national debt to $22 trillion.  It's hard to keep track of  what our national debt is.</p><p>And the amazing thing to me in all of this, Lauren, is the facts that there  was very little that Trump actually got.  I know, he wants to promote the  national security and the spending on the military, when it really comes  down to it, the new funding for new wall is really just for about 33 feet  of new wall.  This is one of the biggest issues that he was elected on.   And out of $1.3 trillion bill, we couldn't find $21billion to $25 billion  to build the southern wall.</p><p>And the thing is, the social concern that I'm also deeply disappointed  about in this omnibus, there's still over half a billion in annual funding  for Planned Parenthood.  I see very little to be happy about in this.  And  when it comes down to the military spending, Lauren, if he had vetoed this  bill and forced them to actually negotiate and challenge them and dared  them to not fund the military, he would have won that bet.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Well, Ned, stay here.  I also want to bring in the  American University Scholar, Capri Cafaro joining us now.  </p><p>Good to see you, Capri.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOLAR:  Absolutely, anytime.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I want to talk to you about something that Senator Bob Corker  tweeted.  I love the tweet.  He said, \"Please do, Mr. President,\" meaning  veto this bill.  \"I'm just down the street and will bring you the pen.  The  spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our  children under the bus.  Totally irresponsible.\"</p><p>Are we now having the President just sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill?   Are we mortgaging millennials' futures?  Are we killing our kids and  grandkids?</p><p>CAFARO:  Well, I mean, any time that you actually, you know, spend without  offset, certainly, I mean, we're continuing to increase the deficit and  debt.  And I do think it's interesting, you know, Bob Corker and Rand Paul  and many other, you know, stalwart Conservatives there, deficit hawks,  certainly, are not excited about a $1.3 trillion spending bill, regardless  what's in it.  And so, I think, that this is a fundamental discussion  amongst the nuances and the branches of the Republican Party.</p><p>Donald Trump has never been an ideological purist, and whether it is, you  know, his issues with trade and tariffs or, you know, these kind of things.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>CAFARO:  I mean, he basically said, \"I might veto this bill because, number  one, it doesn't have more spending and, number two, per the DACA  recipients.  So, you know, if you are a Freedom Caucus guy, you scratch  your head.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's all about the negotiation, Ned.  He's all about the art of  the deal and the compromise.  So he basically said as I saw it, Ned, \"I'll  give you what you want on DACA.  You give me what I want on my wall.\"  But  neither seemed happen?</p><p>RYUN:  No, neither seemed happen.  This is why I'm a little perplexed as to  how this all went down when neither party walked away with what they  wanted.</p><p>Lauren, Trump ran on, I am going to come to Washington.  It will not be  business as usual.  I will drain the swamp.  We will shake up D.C.</p><p>What we saw today is business as usual.  The swamp on the rise.  We did not  see anything that he ran on in 2016.  And people like me were voting for an  outside the box candidate, and what you saw today with him signing this  bill.</p><p>And, again, Democrats didn't get DACA.  He didn't get his wall.  We got  $1.3 trillion.  The taxpayers got saddled with $1.3 trillion extra in  spending.  I'm perplexed as to what we actually voted for in 2016, because  right now what we're seeing is nothing what we expected on that campaign  just a year and a half ago.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And, you know, I'll give you the final answer here,  Capri.  I asked Ned this question earlier, should the President just have  let the government shutdown over this?</p><p>CAFARO:  I don't think so.  I think that that would have been  irresponsible.  You know, they're on recess.</p><p>I think it's important that, you know, you move the ball forward, and I  think he actually framed this very well actually for the 2018 midterms.  He  tried to blame Democrats for overspending and he sent a very strong message  to Washington, to Congress saying, \"We want a certain number of kind of  procedural reforms.\"  So I think he's setting the stage saying, \"Never  again.  I'm going let this go, and if you don't do XYZ, there is a going to  be wrath.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You've been warned.  All right.  Capri, Ned, thank you to both  of you.  Have a good weekend.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks Laura.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Let's turn back to the chaotic markets.  Right now,  stocks are higher.  Paring gains, we did hit session highs on President  Trump's decision to sign the $1.3 trillion spending bill in order to fund  the military the way they need and to keep the government open.  Right now,  Dow industrials up 74 points.  The week has been terrible.</p><p>Let's bring in Vision 4 Fund Distributors Vice President, Heather  Zumarraga, along Tematica Research CIO, Chris Versace.  </p><p>Good to see you, Heather and Chris.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VICE PRESIDENT, VISION 4 FUND DISTRIBUTORS:  Hi.</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, CIO, TEMATICA RESEARCH CIO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You know, they say it's been a chaotic few days for the  markets.  Heather, let me ask you first.  What do you think investors are  responding to most, the fact we are keeping national debt at astronomical  levels and only growing it or growing trade war?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I think a growing trade war.  Investors are responding to that  more.  I know that we're rallying on the backs of the announcement that  President Trump is not going to veto the spending bill, Lauren.  But I  think trade is still a wild card in the markets right now.</p><p>We really don't know the details of final legislation, and so how will that  impact the industrials, the materials, the metals, even technology.  I  think that we'll still weigh on investors' minds and there's more downside  to come.  But the fundamentals are still in place, earnings are up,  inflation remains low and unemployment is low.  So, that's great.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Chris, we had a lot of guests on the show yesterday when the  market was down 724 points at the end of the day, and they were kind of  saying, yes, this is no big deal, this is all part of the negotiation of  the President.  We think when you take a scalpel to these tariffs, we're  going to exempt the right people and everybody can just breathe a sigh of  relief.  And in a sense, they were right today, and I point out Boeing  shares.  Boeing is responsible for most of the Dow's climb.  Is that  signaling to you that everything might be OK in the end as we're gambling  with U.S. versus China versus the rest of the world?</p><p>VERSACE:  Yes, I think what you're seeing is usual stock market, you know,  shoot first, ask questions later.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>VERSACE:  You know, when you look at the data that we're getting, we saw  the March Flash PMI come out, you know, signaling an improvement in the  economy.  I think the big issue that people are getting caught up in is,  you know, demand is improving but the question is, what's the cost  structure going to be?  And I think, that's what getting people a little  nervous.  You know, if we do see these tariffs going into effect,  obviously, steel, aluminum will move higher.  If the response into effect,  other costs could move higher as well.</p><p>And remember, we're getting ready for the March-quarter earnings season  where the markets predicated on 18 percent to 20 percent EPS bump for the  S&amp;P 500 this year.  If that story starts to come undone a little bit, it  likely means the market will give some ground back.  So I think what you're  seeing now is the market getting prepared for that potential conversation,  but there are still strong well-positioned companies out there.  Perhaps we  can buy them now at even better prices.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, Heather, should we buy more domestic companies.  Fewer  multinationals.  And I say that because, what, Nike gets 15 percent of its  revenue from China, right?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Starbucks, about the same percentage from China.  And if we  have a different relationship with China, maybe our big companies need to  rethink their strategy in order to keep their earnings strong?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, you're right.  Over the short term, I think you can look  at smaller cap companies based in the U.S., Russell 2000 is a good gauge of  small cap companies, that aren't heavily impacted of potential trade wars  or China retaliation of our tariffs.  And so these global multinational  companies would be impacted the most.</p><p>I just don't think it makes sense right now to place a bet on a direction  long or short on a global multinational when we don't have the final  details.  Go to Vegas.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We don't know.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, you'd be better off. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, that's an excellent point.  And, Chris, maybe you can help  explain to me how tariffs on, let's say, solar panels, washing machines and  steel deal with the Chinese theft of our trade secrets, our technology, our  intellectual property?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  They do.</p><p>VERSACE:  I would like to be able to say that but I know the answer to  that, but those are two are very different things.  I mean, you know, when  we talk about, you know, the tariffs in a way to help support our national  security and prevent issues from happening, I think, a lot of people can  get behind that.  I think when we talk about washing machines, solar panels  and the other things where we're going to see costs driven up, I think  people, they get caught in the crosshairs a little bit understanding that  we want to buy American but we also have economy that's predicated on cash  strapped consumers trying to spend and spend more, which means we need  cheaper alternatives.  Hence, some of these goods coming in that we've been  relying upon from China.</p><p>So, it's an interesting Catch-22, but I think the long-term question is if  we can get our capacity in the U.S. up to meet demands, get better pricing,  then we can get better paying jobs in the U.S. and help continue the  rebound in the economy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Heather, you talked about this earlier, and I'm not going to --  I agree with you.  Employment situation is looking better, corporate  earnings are strong, the economic data has been good.  But when you look at  numbers, last year GDP in the U.S. averaged 2.3 percent.  Guess what it  averaged in China?  Six point nine percent.  They transitioned from a made- in-China economy to a made-for-China economy, and we need to stop that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, they're still trying transition to consumption economy in  China.  And, look, the data that comes out of China in terms of GDP, I  never really -- you don't know if you can trust the data that's coming out  of China.  They always seem to meet or beat their GDP forecast.  So, it's  always looking rosy over in China.</p><p>But, look, they need us as much as we need them.  We import about $500  billion of stuff from them every year, and although there is a massive  trade deficit, we don't want to hurt China.  In the end, we just want more,  fair playing field, and that's what we're going after.  I'm just not sure  tariffs are the best way to do it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And arguably, who needs who more than the other?  Heather,  Chris, I guess, we don't have all the answers today.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  You got it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Have a great weekend.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  You, too.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, President Trump is signing the massive spending bill  today saying he'll do it for national security.  This, as he names former  U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton as his next National Security  Adviser.  Ambassador Bolton is a foreign policy hawk when it comes to  issues like Iran and North Korea.  So how is all of this going to play out  on the world stage?  We're going to discuss that with Retired Four-star  General Jack Keane, in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Final day of a tough week at the office.  We've got less than  two hours left and the markets are all in the negative.  The Dow is down  two points.  If we're lower today, we're -- this will be the third day of  losses in a row and pretty significant losses at that.  S&amp;P is down 11  points and the NASDAQ selling off the most here on percentage terms by  almost three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>Just moments ago, the President invokes national security in his reason for  signing the $1.3 trillion spending bill vowing that our military will be  the strongest ever, defense stocks rallying on this.</p><p>He also tapped Former Ambassador and Fox News Contributor, John Bolton, as  his new and third National Security Adviser.  Bolton was known for having  hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea.  And earlier today, he told  Stuart Varney this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  I think my view is the  same as the President's, which he's described as the worst deal in American  diplomatic history.  The issue for any deal like this is are you really  solving the problem or you just simply making people feel good while a  country like Iran violates its commitments?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The President had kind words for his Outgoing National Security  Adviser, H.R. McMaster tweeting, I'm very thankful for the service of  General McMaster who has done an outstanding job and will always remain my  friend.</p><p>Joining me now, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.   What do you make of all this, General?</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Well, I think  what's the hardest thing about government and particularly Executive  branches everybody starts a job that they've never had before on the same  day.  And now the President's a year plus into his job, and I think he  understands the presidency now, he understands his role.  He knows what  he's bringing to the table.  What strengths and weaknesses.  And he kind of  knows what he wants from the staff and also from his Cabinet officials,  that's why he's making these changes, because --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So it seems like --</p><p>KEANE:  -- he knows what he wants.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It seems like chaos in the White House is really just growing  pains and now he's got the team in place that he wants.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, pretty much.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.</p><p>KEANE:  I don't think he's finished yet, but it is pretty -- and I think  when you look at, you know, Mike Pompeo over at State and --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  -- and Kudlow in as Economic Adviser and John Bolton, all three of  these people I know and have great respect for them, they're going fit  right like a hand in a glove with what the President is thinking.  They  won't agree with him on everything and I don't think the President  necessarily wants that.  But he clearly wants someone who is going to get  right behind his agenda and support it.</p><p>And, you know, if you spend so much time around these people, you kind of  want to like them as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, let's talk about John Bolton.  Because he is known as  being a military action type of guy, definitely hawkish when it comes to  foreign policy.  He'll start officially in April, which is interesting  because in May, the President is expected to decide the fate of the Iran  nuclear deal and he's also expected to meet with the leader of North Korea.   How do you think John Bolton will affect any of those decisions and  meetings?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, Bolton agrees with the President's national  security strategy.  We're turning to a big power competition, again, with  Russia, China, Iran, rogue state like North Korea who was nuclearizing  ICBM's and is threatening the American people.  So Bolton's approach to  that, as is the President's approach, is to stand up to it not to confront  it.  All those countries we're talking about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.</p><p>KEANE:  Not to appease these countries as the previous administration has  done, which has weakened the relationship that our allies have with each  other and also with us and is emboldened our adversaries.  So, if you want  the diplomatic situation to work effectively, our adversary has to know  that we're at least willing to use a military option if it's necessary and  that's what the President has been trying to convince Kim Jong-un of for a  year plus now.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm imposing economic sanctions on you, but I'm also wanting to use a  military option if those sanctions fail.\"  And I think Bolton will come in  and reinforce that very solidly along with the rest of the national  security team.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  He just -- in the end of February, wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall  Street Journal\" basically saying talking doesn't work.  The title of this  article was \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\"  So we know  who's in charge here and what we're playing with.</p><p>The other issue, and this is something Mr. Bolton certainly knows, is that  North Korea often makes you think they're willing to negotiate when really  they're just trying to buy themselves time to further develop or hide their  weapons.</p><p>KEANE:  Well, that certainly has been the pattern for 25 years.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  In other words, the goal with the negotiations, they buy some time,  they advance their technology and they get concessions.  We don't know for  sure whether these negotiations are sincere or they're phony like the  others.  But we're going to find out here pretty quick.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And what about Russia?  It seems like Mr. Bolton and the  President have different -- Trump has been criticized for appeasing or  overlooking some of the things that Russia does.  And it seems Mr. Bolton  would have a more hard line on Russia?</p><p>KEANE:  I think so.  Most of us take a harder line dealing with Russia than  the President has on all of these issues.  And now, he has stood up to  Russia to be sure.  He is providing lethal aid to the Ukrainian, something  the previous administration never did.</p><p>He struck Assad's air power 36 hours after they used chemical weapons, and  those chemical weapons had passive approval of the Russians in doing that,  you know, who is a client state of Russia.  And clearly we're now  sanctioning Russia.  But I agree, I think what the President is in his head  with this thing, I think, it's a mistake to think he is soft on Russia,  because I don't buy that.</p><p>I think what he believes himself is that -- he's itching to get into the  room with Putin.  And the reason for that is he knows that Putin has  manipulated his three predecessors quite successfully.  And I think he  believes, \"You know, I've dealt with people like this before, I know where  he's coming from.  I know he's a thug and a bully, but I'm not going to say  that in public because I don't want to forfeit my ability to have a real  conversation with this guy.\"  I think that's where the President's head  really is.  And we'll see.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well said, General Keane.  Thank you very much.</p><p>KEANE:  OK.  Good talking to you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>All right.  Let's take a look at this market before we all head out for the  weekend.  You can see down across the board here, S&amp;P is down half of one  percent.  NASDAQ is down three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>We're going live to the New York Stock Exchange next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And while the Dow is below 24,000, stocks turning negative amid  a very choppy session as investors weigh the impact of Congress' trillion  plus dollar spending bill and also a looming trade war with China.  We go  to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange for a rundown of the  chaotic action today.</p><p>Nicole, how are you?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Right, Lauren.  Just to name a few  of the items here front and center on Wall Street with every headline that  comes our way, the Dow is down about a thousand points this week and  yesterday's close of more than 700 points to the downside.  It was about  100 points off of that low in early February.  The hope is not to take out  that low and, in fact, try and keep that as a support level.</p><p>Looking at the Dow right now down 11 points had been down 124 points, up  just about 50.  So we're watching to see where we end.  But for the week  the Dow and the S&amp;P are down about four percent, the NASDAQ down five  percent.  Defense stocks though bucking the trend.</p><p>We've had so much news, of course, Bolton now the National Security  Adviser.  He's hawkish.  The idea that he's going to be spending on our  national security, you can see Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman up about  four percent each.  This group as a group in aerospace and defense group is  seeing it the best day jumping since President Trump was elected to be our  President in November of 2016.</p><p>And a quick look at the big tech IPO of the day.  That's Dropbox in the  Cloud-based file storage area.  Look at this, up 40 percent.  This is the  largest IPO since Snap, Lauren, and it certainly saw the demand even though  that IPO price was raised, it's still jumping.  It seems everybody is  trying to get in on this particular tech stock, and it's a winner today.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Big tech is struggling, Nicole.  And this is, you know,  they call them the unicorns.  Maybe this is the next thing.  We'll see.   Nicole, thank you.</p><p>Well, China is certainly firing back today.  They are threatening  retaliatory tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, this, after  President Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods.  So are we headed  for an all-out trade war?  How bad does it get?  We've got the intel next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, ISIS claiming responsibility for today's hostage  situation in France.  National police there say, at least, three people  were killed and a dozen wounded in what is being described as a terrorist  attack.  The armed gunman, who was shot and killed by police, demanding the  release of one of the Paris attackers from the 2015 Bataclan massacre.</p><p>And video surfacing, and this is hard to watch, of the fatal pedestrian  crash that involved self-driving Uber car.  Well, the 22-second clip shows  a woman walking from a dark area onto the street with her bicycle before  the SUV hits her.  Experts say the vehicle sensors should have spotted her.   Her name was Elaine Herzberg.  She was 49 years old.</p><p>But the video also shows the driver was distracted.  He's called a minder.   He's just operating the self-driving car.  We're also learning he was a  convicted felon.</p><p>And the parents out there, Toys \"R\" Us officially kicking off the going out  of business sale today.  All 735 stores, including Babies \"R\" Us, the  company is not saying how big the discounts will be and obviously there are  no returns here.  Customers will be able to use their gift cards until  April 21st.  But that is the death of an iconic store.</p><p>All right.  Back to the main story today.  China threatening to impose its  own reciprocal tariffs on American goods just one day after President Trump  announced plans to slap steep tariffs on Chinese goods.  Stoking fears that  this might be the beginning of an all-out trade war.  All of this as the  President's broad-based steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in today.  And  the President's demand a pretty simple, he wants free and fair trade with  China.</p><p>Here he is speaking just moments ago at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  China is going to end up treating us fairly.  For many years, they  had free reign, they don't have free reign anymore.  We're very friendly  with China.  We have great relationships with China.  And, look, it's time.   It's time.</p><p>Last year, we lost $500 billion on trade with China.  We can't let that  happen.  And thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Joining me now is Manhattan Institute Senior  Fellow, Steven Malanga.  Good to see you, Steve.</p><p>STEVEN MALANGA, MANHATTAN SENIOR INSTITUTE FELLOW:  Hi.  How are you?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, no matter what number you use, $375 billion, $504 billion  most of our global trade deficit at $800 is with China.</p><p>MALANGA:  Yes.  So--</p><p>SIMONETTI:  How do you fix this?</p><p>MALANGA:  -- all the lost is strange here.  Well, look I think that even  most free traders will tell you that there's imbalance because China  cheats.  China has -- our agreements with them are, in a sense, unfair.   They demand technology from our companies --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MALANGA:  -- in order for some companies to go over this, we have to move  jobs over there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Set up a joint venture with them.  You can't own more than 49  percent of their companies.</p><p>MALANGA:  They ban of our countries' companies.  Facebook can't operate  there.  Of course after the data breach, I doubt they will.  They don't  have to forget about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We'll talk about that later.</p><p>MALANGA:  Right.  So there's no doubt.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right.</p><p>MALANGA:  But the real question that people have is whether Trump has an  actual strategy here, a coherent strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Does he?</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, it's inconsistent.  First of all, this is an administration  that back in 2017 was saying -- Wilbur Ross, for instance, was saying that  we're not going to have to be punitive.  We're going to negotiate with  China, and they're already on board with this.</p><p>The President himself who called China a currency manipulator during his  campaign, he's not declared China a manipulator.  Now all of a sudden,  we're being punitive and it seems it come out of nowhere and even the  Chinese are a little bit confused.  So, people are kind of wondering what's  going on and whether he has a strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And it seems like the tariffs so far on steel and aluminum, on  the washing machines, it seems like they're not addressing the problem.   The main problem is China's theft of our intellectual property.</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, that's exactly right.  Again, there's the sense.  First of  all, people don't know whether when he basically said, \"OK, look, we're  going to slap the tariffs on.\"  And then he pulled them back on Canada and  Mexico, whether they had actually planned that or whether they just said,  \"oops!\" you know, now our trading partners are getting upset with us.</p><p>But the real question, I'll give you an example, OK.  Trump, one of the  ways that you want to increase an imbalance like this is basically to  create more opportunities for American companies.</p><p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership was going to be an opportunity.  It wasn't a  well-negotiated trade deal, OK?  But there was a chance to make that better  and to create opportunities with Asian trading partners in opposition for  China.  Instead Trump just said, \"We're going to abandon it, we're done  with it.\"  That, you see --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Do you think we get back into it on different terms?</p><p>MALANGA:  -- yes, definitely on different terms, but thing is you had a  framework, you had a negotiation, go forward with that.  So, listen, it's  not adequate enough, we're still on the losing end with you folks but we  all need to be united against China.  But that's not what the President  did.  So, that's where he's sending mixed messages.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Do you think we're starting to align as we do, you know, team  Washington versus team Beijing here?  You see these tariffs with many  exemptions.  The E.U and six other countries, one of them being South  Korea, they're exempt from some of these tariffs.  But let me ask you this,  South Korea is exempt, most of Europe is exempt, those markets tanked  today?</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, the interesting thing is, you know, on the list of  potential currency manipulators are South Korea, Japan, Germany, and  European Union.  So they're grouped in there with China, OK.  There's no --  we have imbalances, OK?</p><p>We have with other countries too, where we essentially allow them more  access to our markets than they allow us to their markets.  Trump is right  to focus on that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But the point is  whether a trade war in which he seems to be picking his targets and then  pulling back, he's sending mixed messages to people rather than getting out  and then create more -- demanding more opportunity for American companies  overseas.  That's absolutely a strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Does all of this create American jobs in the end or does it  just hurt the American work of vis-a-vis higher consumer prices?</p><p>MALANGA:  Well, here is the thing, one of the ironies of this right now is  that we have almost record low unemployment.  Usually you start trade wars.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And we're down 3.6 percent --</p><p>MALANGA:  Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- according to the Fed.</p><p>MALANGA:  And here is the thing, right, if you walk right now, OK --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MALANGA:  -- have companies who can't find enough workers, right, because  they have opportunities and we don't have people trained for that.  If you  really wanted to move forward with opportunity right now, the one thing you  would be looking, actually, is getting people better trained to take those  jobs that are open in our own marketplace right now.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Steve, good to see you.  Thank you very much.  All  right.</p><p>Let's see if Steve moved the markets, because they've been all over the  place today.  Every body has moved on.  Dow is down 43 points at 23,917.</p><p>The other markets are lower as well.  All of this as Dropbox, we were a  little bit nervous about this this morning when the futures were tanking  200.  They made their debut on the NASDAQ.  We're going to have more on all  of this in just a bit.</p><p>Look at Dropbox shares rallying 40 percent on day one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Take a look at shares of Dropbox, surging on their first day of  trading.  The company launching its IPO amid a firestorm of economic news.   Currently wreaking havoc in Washington and on Wall Street.  Look at that,  Dropbox priced at 21.  Opened we get 29, it's at 29.46 a pop now.</p><p>Let's go to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where Virtu Financial  trader, Matt Cheslock, joins us now.</p><p>All right.  So, you know, Dropbox not trading where you are, it's at the  NASDAQ, but it's a unicorn, right?  It's a start-up.  It has a billion  dollars in revenue right now.  Valued at about $8, $9 billion.</p><p>Pales in comparison to somebody's huge big textile, all are Amazon and  Netflix, and Alphabet.  They're not holding up so well as we get all the  big tech company.  But investors are still optimistic on tech?</p><p>MATT CHESLOCK, VIRTU FINANCIAL TRADER:  Yes, you know what?  I mean this  was a good barometer for what the market was looking for.  So, maybe you  have the sell-off in the tech sector, maybe they were raising money to buy  Dropbox.  I mean, it was 25 times oversubscribed, right?  So, it had a  tremendous day that despite the market closing down 700 yesterday.</p><p>There had to be worries last night going in to price on that deal, but they  came out through and smelled like roses here.  So, you know, all good from  there.  And, you know, just an example of, you know, what there is on the  tech side.  You know, there are so many of these unicorns that are waiting  to see some money and go public to get the investors involved.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You know, we're looking at the Dow and it is now down in triple  digits once again.  We're not seeing a recovery.  Of course, anything can  happen in this final hour and 10 minutes here.  But we're riding 724-point  sell-off yesterday.  What gives?</p><p>CHESLOCK:  You know what?  I would've rather seen a sharp sell-off this  morning and have us recover throughout the day.  Instead we tried to open  higher and it failed.  We tried multiple times during the day.</p><p>Whatever we can take out of Washington as a positive, you know, the  spending bill that should have been a foregone conclusion, it wasn't even  talked about yesterday.  The only fact that really was mentioned today was  because it was almost got vetoed.  So, other than that, you know, there  hasn't been all lot out there.  It's good stock specific.</p><p>You know, company like Nike and company like Boeing today, you know,  they're performing pretty well outside of the Dropbox.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Boeing is, well, they are --</p><p>CHESLOKCK:  Good work.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- a positive contribution today.  Does that make you feel --  because Boeing is such a multinational, Asia and China are such a big part  of its business, does that encourage you that maybe this trade war won't  get so bad the way Boeing is performing?</p><p>CHESLOCK:  Yes, you know, the fact they weren't mentioned in this first  round of the $3 billion, you know, tit-for-tat here.  So, you know, but  eventually that's going to be leveraged.  Once you start to bring in Boeing  specifically, that may start bringing the U.S at the table a little bit  quicker and maybe we have some real dialogue and we can get down to this.</p><p>We all know that the U.S. doesn't benefit from a trade war but we also  don't benefit anyway from the trade right now.  So, we need to get on equal  footing or somewhat equal footing, so this negotiation is a long way from  over but, you know, at least now we have a starting point.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Matt, thank you very much.</p><p>CHESLOCK:  Sure.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Breaking today, Congress has formally asked  Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify about the company's misuse of  your data.  And shares of Facebook are lower today.  Killed on the week.</p><p>Double digit percentage declines as the Delete Facebook movement gains  steam.  Is this the end for Facebook?  Are you going to delete your  Facebook page?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let's take a look at the sell-off on Wall Street.  Dow is down  113 points as we head into the final hour of trading.  Financials getting  killed the most today.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress has formally asked CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, to  testify about what the company is doing to protect user data and privacy.   This, after it was revealed that the data firm Cambridge Analytica may have  improperly gain access to data of million, 50 million Facebook users.</p><p>Joining me now, our very own, Deirdre Bolton, along with Founder of  Disruptive Tech Research, Lou Basenese.</p><p>Deirdre, do you think people are really going to delete Facebook?  We know  that Elon Musk has.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  I was just going to say, if you want  to one person, Elon Musk, he actually was kind of funny about it.  I swear  that he got nothing, he was like, oh, yes, I didn't even realize that  SpaceX or Tesla had their own pages, 2.5 million --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  On each.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- on each.  So, and they said, oh, yes, this looks kind of lame.   I'll just have to delete it anyway.  So, yes, basically 5 million gone --  users gone from Facebook.  So he is keeping his Instagram account, I guess  he should underline that, and as we know Facebook owns Instagram.  But, he  says that he doesn't feel that Facebook's influence is creeping in, those  are his words, not mine, into the Instagram account as much for which he  has about 7 million followers.</p><p>But, I do think this underlines -- this is the real business risk for  Facebook is that OK, this is kind of funny, it's Elon Musk, it's one person  but he has Tesla, he has SpaceX, he's widely followed as an entrepreneur.   And just the idea that maybe Facebook becomes less cool, less usable and  this Delete Facebook has actually gained some traction.</p><p>On the other side, it has more than 2 billion users.  A lot of people use  it, a lot of even older people to see pictures of grandkids, people who  have family members overseas.  So, it doesn't go away so easily either.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Even to date, Lou, if you're on tinder and you most likely need  a Facebook account, they kind of go hand-in-hand.  It's so ingrained in our  society.</p><p>LOUIS BASENESE, FOUNDER; DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Yes, it is.  I think  Facebook widely recognized long ago that they needed to have their  tentacles into our lives across multiple platforms.  And like Deirdre said,  there's Instagram, there's Facebook Messenger.  They found ways to make it  much harder to delete Facebook.</p><p>And, you know, I would tell you, I think the biggest risk here, the Delete  Facebook movement is definitely a risk, but the biggest risk here comes  from advertisers.  If they protest and bail en masse, then the business  falls apart.  And, you know, I think that's a low probability, ironically  because Facebook's data on its users is so good and its scale is so big,  over 2 billion users, advertisers aren't going to give up that marketing  channel.</p><p>So, you know, look, I think we said this earlier in the week, Lauren, this,  too, shall pass for Facebook, but this nightmare is far from over.  There's  going to be a lot of questions to be answered in uncomfortable situations  for the CEO.</p><p>BOLTON:  Indeed, and it's also a business problem as we've talked about,  too, in the sense that Facebook has to decide are we actually going to  spend more money to get human engineers who cost money, who want vacations,  who want personal time?  But they probably need to hire a lot of people to  make sure that these data infractions aren't repeated.</p><p>I want a message as well or let you know about this message that we got  from Cambridge Analytica.  The acting CEO says the data that had been  obtained from Facebook was in line with Facebook's term of service and data  protection laws.  So that's a pretty -- and basically, Cambridge Analytica  is saying, hey, listen, we didn't do anything wrong.  We were following the  map, if you like, that Facebook set out.</p><p>BASENESE:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So that's going to be one of the conversations that's continued,  to your point Lou, in D.C. and Mark Zuckerberg, is going to have to, I  mean, the New York A.G. has started an investigation, the Massachusetts  A.G., has started an investigation.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BOLTON:  Senators Thune, Nelson, saying, listen, Mark Zuckerberg, you need  to come here to D.C., you need to tell us --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And overseas there are investigations resume --</p><p>BOLTON:  -- the U.K.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Dow just fell about 200 points.  And typically, Lou, we've  seen the big tech companies, the so-called fang stocks recovered pretty  quickly when there's a big sell-off.  We're not seeing that this time  around.  What do you make of that?</p><p>BASENESE:  I'm not too concern of that, I think this is the trickle-down  effects from the regulatory threats that are facing Facebook, right?   You've already had some Congress representatives calling in potentially  other CEOs from tech companies to talk about regulating their data.  I  mean, this is just turning into a short-term debacle for Facebook, and it's  spilling over into the larger tech stocks.</p><p>I think if you want to look for protection, you've got to go somewhere into  the small and micro cap land that are largely insulated from all of this.   But right now, the headline of the day is going to be the breach of user  trust and, you know, there's an old ancient Jewish scholar that once said,  be careful, your sins will find you out.  And Facebook is learning that the  hard way right now.  Like Cambridge, Deirdre just share, the Cambridge CEO  has pointing their finger at Facebook saying, hey, we didn't do anything  wrong, you're the one that originally sent here gave us access to the user  data.  And it's going to be really hard to restore trust when users know  that that was given so freely.</p><p>SIMONETTI: One story that just is not going away because it implicates  regulation and other companies as well.  Lou, Deirdre, thank you so much  for your perspective today.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And that is it for me, but you can watch me every weekday, 5  a.m. Eastern on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now, Ashley Webster is in for Liz Claman.  And Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Here we go again.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Lock and load.</p><p>WEBSTER:  TGIF.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  There you go.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But we had a big sell-off and here we are an hour to go before  the bell rings that brings to the end, a very ugly week.  Lauren Simonetti,  thank you very much.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Right now, we are near session highs for the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 137 points. What a Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us. I'm Lauren Simonetti. I'm in for Trish Regan and welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT. Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>shaking Capitol Hill today threatening to veto the spending bill saying it didn't spend enough on his border wall. Then he said he would sign it but never anything like it ever, ever again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things that's I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill but we were, in a sense, forced if we want to build our military. We were forced to have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: We're going to have more on that straight ahead.</p><p>And stocks, as we've noted, down sharply. Yesterday, down in the pre- market. Guess what? They opened higher today but moments after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>threatened to veto the omnibus bill came, the markets retreated, went negative then they bounced back again as we learned that the President would sign the spending bill. It's so crazy.</p><p>We also have fears of a trade war. They continue today as China now threatens to retaliate after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>imposed about $60 billion on tariffs on Chinese goods. What does this mean for the world's two largest economies? We're on that story as well.</p><p>But first, we go to Adam Shapiro who is live at the White House with the latest on the spending bill. Adam the guessing game is now over?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: The guessing game is over, and you heard the President say he did this for the sake of national security. You heard Defense Secretary <person><nameText>Mattis </nameText></person>talking about this and this is the largest military spending in U.S. history to help rebuild the nation's military and secure the national defense. But the President is not pleased because, as he said as he was leaving the diplomatic room at the White House, that he very seriously considered a veto because while the administration got some of what it wanted, this didn't fix DACA and he had a message to Hispanic- Americans saying, \"Republicans are working in your interest better than Democrats.\" He was very upset with this.</p><p>And as you have -- in the introduction, the sound bite in which he said he would never sign a bill like this again, one way to avoid that, he said, would be to revoke the filibuster the Senate has. Here is the President in his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: Now, political analysts have said, one, even if they had the filibuster removed from the Senate, they were missing John McCain. So the Republicans would not have had the majority that the President thinks that he might have been able to get.</p><p>The other issue, of course, was to DACA. The President wanted a fix that would have allowed the DACA students, roughly 800,000 people, to have 2.5 year extension in exchange for the Democrats fully funding the border wall with Mexico $25 billion. The Democrats wanted a permanent fix for the DACA students and other aliens who have come to the United States illegally and the President wouldn't do that because he wanted full funding for the border wall.</p><p>Here is what the President said about that situation in the negotiations of the omnibus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats. We wanted to include DACA. We wanted to have them in this bill. Eight hundred thousand people. And actually it could even be more.</p><p>And we wanted to include DACA in this bill. The Democrats would not do it. They would not do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So Lauren, the President, although he doesn't say he got some of what the administration wanted in the bill, the biggest thing was rebuilding the U.S. Military. And as you heard at the beginning of the 2:00 hour, the President signed this bill, this $1.3 trillion bill, which he called ridiculous. He signed it for the sake of national security.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And the defense stocks certainly appreciating that today. They are up sharply. Adam, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Joining me now is the American Majority CEO, Ned Ryun, to talk about everything we just heard and everything that's gotten down the past 24 hours or so. Right now, we have averted a government shutdown. The question is, is that bad for Republicans because basically we control the White House and Congress as Republicans, and we just -- you had the President sign the second biggest spending bill ever, would a veto, Ned, have been worse? A government shutdown?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: I actually think Trump was morally obligated to veto this omnibus bill. Let's not forget, Congress could have passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government open. This omnibus is a big government dream come true, and Trump, you know, two weeks ago, the President should have engaged more heavily.</p><p>The second best time was now veto the bill and start negotiating for a better deal on just a wide variety of fronts. I mean take away the names of those people that sign this, Republican Congress and the Republican President. This seems like we just went back to the future where this could be done by Obama and the Democrat Congress signing a $1.3 trillion bill to take our national debt to $22 trillion. It's hard to keep track of what our national debt is.</p><p>And the amazing thing to me in all of this, Lauren, is the facts that there was very little that Trump actually got. I know, he wants to promote the national security and the spending on the military, when it really comes down to it, the new funding for new wall is really just for about 33 feet of new wall. This is one of the biggest issues that he was elected on. And out of $1.3 trillion bill, we couldn't find $21billion to $25 billion to build the southern wall.</p><p>And the thing is, the social concern that I'm also deeply disappointed about in this omnibus, there's still over half a billion in annual funding for Planned Parenthood. I see very little to be happy about in this. And when it comes down to the military spending, Lauren, if he had vetoed this bill and forced them to actually negotiate and challenge them and dared them to not fund the military, he would have won that bet.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Well, Ned, stay here. I also want to bring in the American University Scholar, Capri Cafaro joining us now.</p><p>Good to see you, Capri.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOLAR: Absolutely, anytime.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I want to talk to you about something that Senator Bob Corker tweeted. I love the tweet. He said, \"Please do, Mr. President,\" meaning veto this bill. \"I'm just down the street and will bring you the pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible.\"</p><p>Are we now having the President just sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill? Are we mortgaging millennials' futures? Are we killing our kids and grandkids?</p><p>CAFARO: Well, I mean, any time that you actually, you know, spend without offset, certainly, I mean, we're continuing to increase the deficit and debt. And I do think it's interesting, you know, Bob Corker and Rand Paul and many other, you know, stalwart Conservatives there, deficit hawks, certainly, are not excited about a $1.3 trillion spending bill, regardless what's in it. And so, I think, that this is a fundamental discussion amongst the nuances and the branches of the Republican Party.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has never been an ideological purist, and whether it is, you know, his issues with trade and tariffs or, you know, these kind of things.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>CAFARO: I mean, he basically said, \"I might veto this bill because, number one, it doesn't have more spending and, number two, per the DACA recipients. So, you know, if you are a Freedom Caucus guy, you scratch your head.</p><p>SIMONETTI: He's all about the negotiation, Ned. He's all about the art of the deal and the compromise. So he basically said as I saw it, Ned, \"I'll give you what you want on DACA. You give me what I want on my wall.\" But neither seemed happen?</p><p>RYUN: No, neither seemed happen. This is why I'm a little perplexed as to how this all went down when neither party walked away with what they wanted.</p><p>Lauren, Trump ran on, I am going to come to Washington. It will not be business as usual. I will drain the swamp. We will shake up D.C.</p><p>What we saw today is business as usual. The swamp on the rise. We did not see anything that he ran on in 2016. And people like me were voting for an outside the box candidate, and what you saw today with him signing this bill.</p><p>And, again, Democrats didn't get DACA. He didn't get his wall. We got $1.3 trillion. The taxpayers got saddled with $1.3 trillion extra in spending. I'm perplexed as to what we actually voted for in 2016, because right now what we're seeing is nothing what we expected on that campaign just a year and a half ago.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. And, you know, I'll give you the final answer here, Capri. I asked Ned this question earlier, should the President just have let the government shutdown over this?</p><p>CAFARO: I don't think so. I think that that would have been irresponsible. You know, they're on recess.</p><p>I think it's important that, you know, you move the ball forward, and I think he actually framed this very well actually for the 2018 midterms. He tried to blame Democrats for overspending and he sent a very strong message to Washington, to Congress saying, \"We want a certain number of kind of procedural reforms.\" So I think he's setting the stage saying, \"Never again. I'm going let this go, and if you don't do XYZ, there is a going to be wrath.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You've been warned. All right. Capri, Ned, thank you to both of you. Have a good weekend.</p><p>RYUN: Thanks Laura.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Let's turn back to the chaotic markets. Right now, stocks are higher. Paring gains, we did hit session highs on <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>decision to sign the $1.3 trillion spending bill in order to fund the military the way they need and to keep the government open. Right now, Dow industrials up 74 points. The week has been terrible.</p><p>Let's bring in Vision 4 Fund Distributors Vice President, Heather Zumarraga, along Tematica Research CIO, Chris Versace.</p><p>Good to see you, Heather and Chris.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VICE PRESIDENT, VISION 4 FUND DISTRIBUTORS: Hi.</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, CIO, TEMATICA RESEARCH CIO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You know, they say it's been a chaotic few days for the markets. Heather, let me ask you first. What do you think investors are responding to most, the fact we are keeping national debt at astronomical levels and only growing it or growing trade war?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: I think a growing trade war. Investors are responding to that more. I know that we're rallying on the backs of the announcement that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is not going to veto the spending bill, Lauren. But I think trade is still a wild card in the markets right now.</p><p>We really don't know the details of final legislation, and so how will that impact the industrials, the materials, the metals, even technology. I think that we'll still weigh on investors' minds and there's more downside to come. But the fundamentals are still in place, earnings are up, inflation remains low and unemployment is low. So, that's great.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Chris, we had a lot of guests on the show yesterday when the market was down 724 points at the end of the day, and they were kind of saying, yes, this is no big deal, this is all part of the negotiation of the President. We think when you take a scalpel to these tariffs, we're going to exempt the right people and everybody can just breathe a sigh of relief. And in a sense, they were right today, and I point out Boeing shares. Boeing is responsible for most of the Dow's climb. Is that signaling to you that everything might be OK in the end as we're gambling with U.S. versus China versus the rest of the world?</p><p>VERSACE: Yes, I think what you're seeing is usual stock market, you know, shoot first, ask questions later.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>VERSACE: You know, when you look at the data that we're getting, we saw the March Flash PMI come out, you know, signaling an improvement in the economy. I think the big issue that people are getting caught up in is, you know, demand is improving but the question is, what's the cost structure going to be? And I think, that's what getting people a little nervous. You know, if we do see these tariffs going into effect, obviously, steel, aluminum will move higher. If the response into effect, other costs could move higher as well.</p><p>And remember, we're getting ready for the March-quarter earnings season where the markets predicated on 18 percent to 20 percent EPS bump for the S&amp;P 500 this year. If that story starts to come undone a little bit, it likely means the market will give some ground back. So I think what you're seeing now is the market getting prepared for that potential conversation, but there are still strong well-positioned companies out there. Perhaps we can buy them now at even better prices.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So, Heather, should we buy more domestic companies. Fewer multinationals. And I say that because, what, Nike gets 15 percent of its revenue from China, right?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Starbucks, about the same percentage from China. And if we have a different relationship with China, maybe our big companies need to rethink their strategy in order to keep their earnings strong?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes, you're right. Over the short term, I think you can look at smaller cap companies based in the U.S., Russell 2000 is a good gauge of small cap companies, that aren't heavily impacted of potential trade wars or China retaliation of our tariffs. And so these global multinational companies would be impacted the most.</p><p>I just don't think it makes sense right now to place a bet on a direction long or short on a global multinational when we don't have the final details. Go to Vegas.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We don't know.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes, you'd be better off.</p><p>SIMONETTI: No, that's an excellent point. And, Chris, maybe you can help explain to me how tariffs on, let's say, solar panels, washing machines and steel deal with the Chinese theft of our trade secrets, our technology, our intellectual property?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: They do.</p><p>VERSACE: I would like to be able to say that but I know the answer to that, but those are two are very different things. I mean, you know, when we talk about, you know, the tariffs in a way to help support our national security and prevent issues from happening, I think, a lot of people can get behind that. I think when we talk about washing machines, solar panels and the other things where we're going to see costs driven up, I think people, they get caught in the crosshairs a little bit understanding that we want to buy American but we also have economy that's predicated on cash strapped consumers trying to spend and spend more, which means we need cheaper alternatives. Hence, some of these goods coming in that we've been relying upon from China.</p><p>So, it's an interesting Catch-22, but I think the long-term question is if we can get our capacity in the U.S. up to meet demands, get better pricing, then we can get better paying jobs in the U.S. and help continue the rebound in the economy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Heather, you talked about this earlier, and I'm not going to -- I agree with you. Employment situation is looking better, corporate earnings are strong, the economic data has been good. But when you look at numbers, last year GDP in the U.S. averaged 2.3 percent. Guess what it averaged in China? Six point nine percent. They transitioned from a made- in-China economy to a made-for-China economy, and we need to stop that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes, they're still trying transition to consumption economy in China. And, look, the data that comes out of China in terms of GDP, I never really -- you don't know if you can trust the data that's coming out of China. They always seem to meet or beat their GDP forecast. So, it's always looking rosy over in China.</p><p>But, look, they need us as much as we need them. We import about $500 billion of stuff from them every year, and although there is a massive trade deficit, we don't want to hurt China. In the end, we just want more, fair playing field, and that's what we're going after. I'm just not sure tariffs are the best way to do it.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And arguably, who needs who more than the other? Heather, Chris, I guess, we don't have all the answers today. Thank you so much.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: You got it.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Have a great weekend.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: You, too.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is signing the massive spending bill today saying he'll do it for national security. This, as he names former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton as his next National Security Adviser. Ambassador Bolton is a foreign policy hawk when it comes to issues like Iran and North Korea. So how is all of this going to play out on the world stage? We're going to discuss that with Retired Four-star General Jack Keane, in a moment.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Final day of a tough week at the office. We've got less than two hours left and the markets are all in the negative. The Dow is down two points. If we're lower today, we're -- this will be the third day of losses in a row and pretty significant losses at that. S&amp;P is down 11 points and the NASDAQ selling off the most here on percentage terms by almost three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>Just moments ago, the President invokes national security in his reason for signing the $1.3 trillion spending bill vowing that our military will be the strongest ever, defense stocks rallying on this.</p><p>He also tapped Former Ambassador and Fox News Contributor, John Bolton, as his new and third National Security Adviser. Bolton was known for having hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea. And earlier today, he told Stuart Varney this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I think my view is the same as the President's, which he's described as the worst deal in American diplomatic history. The issue for any deal like this is are you really solving the problem or you just simply making people feel good while a country like Iran violates its commitments?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: The President had kind words for his Outgoing National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster tweeting, I'm very thankful for the service of General McMaster who has done an outstanding job and will always remain my friend.</p><p>Joining me now, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane. What do you make of all this, General?</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, I think what's the hardest thing about government and particularly Executive branches everybody starts a job that they've never had before on the same day. And now the President's a year plus into his job, and I think he understands the presidency now, he understands his role. He knows what he's bringing to the table. What strengths and weaknesses. And he kind of knows what he wants from the staff and also from his Cabinet officials, that's why he's making these changes, because --</p><p>SIMONETTI: So it seems like --</p><p>KEANE: -- he knows what he wants.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It seems like chaos in the White House is really just growing pains and now he's got the team in place that he wants.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, pretty much.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK.</p><p>KEANE: I don't think he's finished yet, but it is pretty -- and I think when you look at, you know, Mike Pompeo over at State and --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: -- and Kudlow in as Economic Adviser and John Bolton, all three of these people I know and have great respect for them, they're going fit right like a hand in a glove with what the President is thinking. They won't agree with him on everything and I don't think the President necessarily wants that. But he clearly wants someone who is going to get right behind his agenda and support it.</p><p>And, you know, if you spend so much time around these people, you kind of want to like them as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, let's talk about John Bolton. Because he is known as being a military action type of guy, definitely hawkish when it comes to foreign policy. He'll start officially in April, which is interesting because in May, the President is expected to decide the fate of the Iran nuclear deal and he's also expected to meet with the leader of North Korea. How do you think John Bolton will affect any of those decisions and meetings?</p><p>KEANE: Well, first of all, Bolton agrees with the President's national security strategy. We're turning to a big power competition, again, with Russia, China, Iran, rogue state like North Korea who was nuclearizing ICBM's and is threatening the American people. So Bolton's approach to that, as is the President's approach, is to stand up to it not to confront it. All those countries we're talking about.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right.</p><p>KEANE: Not to appease these countries as the previous administration has done, which has weakened the relationship that our allies have with each other and also with us and is emboldened our adversaries. So, if you want the diplomatic situation to work effectively, our adversary has to know that we're at least willing to use a military option if it's necessary and that's what the President has been trying to convince Kim Jong-un of for a year plus now.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm imposing economic sanctions on you, but I'm also wanting to use a military option if those sanctions fail.\" And I think Bolton will come in and reinforce that very solidly along with the rest of the national security team.</p><p>SIMONETTI: He just -- in the end of February, wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" basically saying talking doesn't work. The title of this article was \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\" So we know who's in charge here and what we're playing with.</p><p>The other issue, and this is something Mr. Bolton certainly knows, is that North Korea often makes you think they're willing to negotiate when really they're just trying to buy themselves time to further develop or hide their weapons.</p><p>KEANE: Well, that certainly has been the pattern for 25 years.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: In other words, the goal with the negotiations, they buy some time, they advance their technology and they get concessions. We don't know for sure whether these negotiations are sincere or they're phony like the others. But we're going to find out here pretty quick.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And what about Russia? It seems like Mr. Bolton and the President have different -- Trump has been criticized for appeasing or overlooking some of the things that Russia does. And it seems Mr. Bolton would have a more hard line on Russia?</p><p>KEANE: I think so. Most of us take a harder line dealing with Russia than the President has on all of these issues. And now, he has stood up to Russia to be sure. He is providing lethal aid to the Ukrainian, something the previous administration never did.</p><p>He struck Assad's air power 36 hours after they used chemical weapons, and those chemical weapons had passive approval of the Russians in doing that, you know, who is a client state of Russia. And clearly we're now sanctioning Russia. But I agree, I think what the President is in his head with this thing, I think, it's a mistake to think he is soft on Russia, because I don't buy that.</p><p>I think what he believes himself is that -- he's itching to get into the room with Putin. And the reason for that is he knows that Putin has manipulated his three predecessors quite successfully. And I think he believes, \"You know, I've dealt with people like this before, I know where he's coming from. I know he's a thug and a bully, but I'm not going to say that in public because I don't want to forfeit my ability to have a real conversation with this guy.\" I think that's where the President's head really is. And we'll see.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well said, General Keane. Thank you very much.</p><p>KEANE: OK. Good talking to you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Have a great weekend.</p><p>All right. Let's take a look at this market before we all head out for the weekend. You can see down across the board here, S&amp;P is down half of one percent. NASDAQ is down three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>We're going live to the New York Stock Exchange next.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And while the Dow is below 24,000, stocks turning negative amid a very choppy session as investors weigh the impact of Congress' trillion plus dollar spending bill and also a looming trade war with China. We go to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange for a rundown of the chaotic action today.</p><p>Nicole, how are you?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Right, Lauren. Just to name a few of the items here front and center on Wall Street with every headline that comes our way, the Dow is down about a thousand points this week and yesterday's close of more than 700 points to the downside. It was about 100 points off of that low in early February. The hope is not to take out that low and, in fact, try and keep that as a support level.</p><p>Looking at the Dow right now down 11 points had been down 124 points, up just about 50. So we're watching to see where we end. But for the week the Dow and the S&amp;P are down about four percent, the NASDAQ down five percent. Defense stocks though bucking the trend.</p><p>We've had so much news, of course, Bolton now the National Security Adviser. He's hawkish. The idea that he's going to be spending on our national security, you can see Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman up about four percent each. This group as a group in aerospace and defense group is seeing it the best day jumping since <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was elected to be our President in November of 2016.</p><p>And a quick look at the big tech IPO of the day. That's Dropbox in the Cloud-based file storage area. Look at this, up 40 percent. This is the largest IPO since Snap, Lauren, and it certainly saw the demand even though that IPO price was raised, it's still jumping. It seems everybody is trying to get in on this particular tech stock, and it's a winner today.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. Big tech is struggling, Nicole. And this is, you know, they call them the unicorns. Maybe this is the next thing. We'll see. Nicole, thank you.</p><p>Well, China is certainly firing back today. They are threatening retaliatory tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, this, after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>announced new tariffs on Chinese goods. So are we headed for an all-out trade war? How bad does it get? We've got the intel next.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, ISIS claiming responsibility for today's hostage situation in France. National police there say, at least, three people were killed and a dozen wounded in what is being described as a terrorist attack. The armed gunman, who was shot and killed by police, demanding the release of one of the Paris attackers from the 2015 Bataclan massacre.</p><p>And video surfacing, and this is hard to watch, of the fatal pedestrian crash that involved self-driving Uber car. Well, the 22-second clip shows a woman walking from a dark area onto the street with her bicycle before the SUV hits her. Experts say the vehicle sensors should have spotted her. Her name was Elaine Herzberg. She was 49 years old.</p><p>But the video also shows the driver was distracted. He's called a minder. He's just operating the self-driving car. We're also learning he was a convicted felon.</p><p>And the parents out there, Toys \"R\" Us officially kicking off the going out of business sale today. All 735 stores, including Babies \"R\" Us, the company is not saying how big the discounts will be and obviously there are no returns here. Customers will be able to use their gift cards until April 21st. But that is the death of an iconic store.</p><p>All right. Back to the main story today. China threatening to impose its own reciprocal tariffs on American goods just one day after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>announced plans to slap steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Stoking fears that this might be the beginning of an all-out trade war. All of this as the President's broad-based steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in today. And the President's demand a pretty simple, he wants free and fair trade with China.</p><p>Here he is speaking just moments ago at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: China is going to end up treating us fairly. For many years, they had free reign, they don't have free reign anymore. We're very friendly with China. We have great relationships with China. And, look, it's time. It's time.</p><p>Last year, we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let that happen. And thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Joining me now is Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow, Steven Malanga. Good to see you, Steve.</p><p>STEVEN MALANGA, MANHATTAN SENIOR INSTITUTE FELLOW: Hi. How are you?</p><p>SIMONETTI: So, no matter what number you use, $375 billion, $504 billion most of our global trade deficit at $800 is with China.</p><p>MALANGA: Yes. So--</p><p>SIMONETTI: How do you fix this?</p><p>MALANGA: -- all the lost is strange here. Well, look I think that even most free traders will tell you that there's imbalance because China cheats. China has -- our agreements with them are, in a sense, unfair. They demand technology from our companies --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>MALANGA: -- in order for some companies to go over this, we have to move jobs over there.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Set up a joint venture with them. You can't own more than 49 percent of their companies.</p><p>MALANGA: They ban of our countries' companies. Facebook can't operate there. Of course after the data breach, I doubt they will. They don't have to forget about.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We'll talk about that later.</p><p>MALANGA: Right. So there's no doubt.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right.</p><p>MALANGA: But the real question that people have is whether Trump has an actual strategy here, a coherent strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Does he?</p><p>MALANGA: Well, it's inconsistent. First of all, this is an administration that back in 2017 was saying -- Wilbur Ross, for instance, was saying that we're not going to have to be punitive. We're going to negotiate with China, and they're already on board with this.</p><p>The President himself who called China a currency manipulator during his campaign, he's not declared China a manipulator. Now all of a sudden, we're being punitive and it seems it come out of nowhere and even the Chinese are a little bit confused. So, people are kind of wondering what's going on and whether he has a strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And it seems like the tariffs so far on steel and aluminum, on the washing machines, it seems like they're not addressing the problem. The main problem is China's theft of our intellectual property.</p><p>MALANGA: Well, that's exactly right. Again, there's the sense. First of all, people don't know whether when he basically said, \"OK, look, we're going to slap the tariffs on.\" And then he pulled them back on Canada and Mexico, whether they had actually planned that or whether they just said, \"oops!\" you know, now our trading partners are getting upset with us.</p><p>But the real question, I'll give you an example, OK. Trump, one of the ways that you want to increase an imbalance like this is basically to create more opportunities for American companies.</p><p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership was going to be an opportunity. It wasn't a well-negotiated trade deal, OK? But there was a chance to make that better and to create opportunities with Asian trading partners in opposition for China. Instead Trump just said, \"We're going to abandon it, we're done with it.\" That, you see --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Do you think we get back into it on different terms?</p><p>MALANGA: -- yes, definitely on different terms, but thing is you had a framework, you had a negotiation, go forward with that. So, listen, it's not adequate enough, we're still on the losing end with you folks but we all need to be united against China. But that's not what the President did. So, that's where he's sending mixed messages.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Do you think we're starting to align as we do, you know, team Washington versus team Beijing here? You see these tariffs with many exemptions. The E.U and six other countries, one of them being South Korea, they're exempt from some of these tariffs. But let me ask you this, South Korea is exempt, most of Europe is exempt, those markets tanked today?</p><p>MALANGA: Well, the interesting thing is, you know, on the list of potential currency manipulators are South Korea, Japan, Germany, and European Union. So they're grouped in there with China, OK. There's no -- we have imbalances, OK?</p><p>We have with other countries too, where we essentially allow them more access to our markets than they allow us to their markets. Trump is right to focus on that. There's nothing wrong with that. But the point is whether a trade war in which he seems to be picking his targets and then pulling back, he's sending mixed messages to people rather than getting out and then create more -- demanding more opportunity for American companies overseas. That's absolutely a strategy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Does all of this create American jobs in the end or does it just hurt the American work of vis-a-vis higher consumer prices?</p><p>MALANGA: Well, here is the thing, one of the ironies of this right now is that we have almost record low unemployment. Usually you start trade wars.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And we're down 3.6 percent --</p><p>MALANGA: Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- according to the Fed.</p><p>MALANGA: And here is the thing, right, if you walk right now, OK --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>MALANGA: -- have companies who can't find enough workers, right, because they have opportunities and we don't have people trained for that. If you really wanted to move forward with opportunity right now, the one thing you would be looking, actually, is getting people better trained to take those jobs that are open in our own marketplace right now.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Steve, good to see you. Thank you very much. All right.</p><p>Let's see if Steve moved the markets, because they've been all over the place today. Every body has moved on. Dow is down 43 points at 23,917.</p><p>The other markets are lower as well. All of this as Dropbox, we were a little bit nervous about this this morning when the futures were tanking 200. They made their debut on the NASDAQ. We're going to have more on all of this in just a bit.</p><p>Look at Dropbox shares rallying 40 percent on day one.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Take a look at shares of Dropbox, surging on their first day of trading. The company launching its IPO amid a firestorm of economic news. Currently wreaking havoc in Washington and on Wall Street. Look at that, Dropbox priced at 21. Opened we get 29, it's at 29.46 a pop now.</p><p>Let's go to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where Virtu Financial trader, Matt Cheslock, joins us now.</p><p>All right. So, you know, Dropbox not trading where you are, it's at the NASDAQ, but it's a unicorn, right? It's a start-up. It has a billion dollars in revenue right now. Valued at about $8, $9 billion.</p><p>Pales in comparison to somebody's huge big textile, all are Amazon and Netflix, and Alphabet. They're not holding up so well as we get all the big tech company. But investors are still optimistic on tech?</p><p>MATT CHESLOCK, VIRTU FINANCIAL TRADER: Yes, you know what? I mean this was a good barometer for what the market was looking for. So, maybe you have the sell-off in the tech sector, maybe they were raising money to buy Dropbox. I mean, it was 25 times oversubscribed, right? So, it had a tremendous day that despite the market closing down 700 yesterday.</p><p>There had to be worries last night going in to price on that deal, but they came out through and smelled like roses here. So, you know, all good from there. And, you know, just an example of, you know, what there is on the tech side. You know, there are so many of these unicorns that are waiting to see some money and go public to get the investors involved.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You know, we're looking at the Dow and it is now down in triple digits once again. We're not seeing a recovery. Of course, anything can happen in this final hour and 10 minutes here. But we're riding 724-point sell-off yesterday. What gives?</p><p>CHESLOCK: You know what? I would've rather seen a sharp sell-off this morning and have us recover throughout the day. Instead we tried to open higher and it failed. We tried multiple times during the day.</p><p>Whatever we can take out of Washington as a positive, you know, the spending bill that should have been a foregone conclusion, it wasn't even talked about yesterday. The only fact that really was mentioned today was because it was almost got vetoed. So, other than that, you know, there hasn't been all lot out there. It's good stock specific.</p><p>You know, company like Nike and company like Boeing today, you know, they're performing pretty well outside of the Dropbox.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. Boeing is, well, they are --</p><p>CHESLOKCK: Good work.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- a positive contribution today. Does that make you feel -- because Boeing is such a multinational, Asia and China are such a big part of its business, does that encourage you that maybe this trade war won't get so bad the way Boeing is performing?</p><p>CHESLOCK: Yes, you know, the fact they weren't mentioned in this first round of the $3 billion, you know, tit-for-tat here. So, you know, but eventually that's going to be leveraged. Once you start to bring in Boeing specifically, that may start bringing the U.S at the table a little bit quicker and maybe we have some real dialogue and we can get down to this.</p><p>We all know that the U.S. doesn't benefit from a trade war but we also don't benefit anyway from the trade right now. So, we need to get on equal footing or somewhat equal footing, so this negotiation is a long way from over but, you know, at least now we have a starting point.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Matt, thank you very much.</p><p>CHESLOCK: Sure.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Breaking today, Congress has formally asked Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify about the company's misuse of your data. And shares of Facebook are lower today. Killed on the week.</p><p>Double digit percentage declines as the Delete Facebook movement gains steam. Is this the end for Facebook? Are you going to delete your Facebook page?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Let's take a look at the sell-off on Wall Street. Dow is down 113 points as we head into the final hour of trading. Financials getting killed the most today.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress has formally asked CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify about what the company is doing to protect user data and privacy. This, after it was revealed that the data firm Cambridge Analytica may have improperly gain access to data of million, 50 million Facebook users.</p><p>Joining me now, our very own, Deirdre Bolton, along with Founder of Disruptive Tech Research, Lou Basenese.</p><p>Deirdre, do you think people are really going to delete Facebook? We know that Elon Musk has.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: I was just going to say, if you want to one person, Elon Musk, he actually was kind of funny about it. I swear that he got nothing, he was like, oh, yes, I didn't even realize that SpaceX or Tesla had their own pages, 2.5 million --</p><p>SIMONETTI: On each.</p><p>BOLTON: -- on each. So, and they said, oh, yes, this looks kind of lame. I'll just have to delete it anyway. So, yes, basically 5 million gone -- users gone from Facebook. So he is keeping his Instagram account, I guess he should underline that, and as we know Facebook owns Instagram. But, he says that he doesn't feel that Facebook's influence is creeping in, those are his words, not mine, into the Instagram account as much for which he has about 7 million followers.</p><p>But, I do think this underlines -- this is the real business risk for Facebook is that OK, this is kind of funny, it's Elon Musk, it's one person but he has Tesla, he has SpaceX, he's widely followed as an entrepreneur. And just the idea that maybe Facebook becomes less cool, less usable and this Delete Facebook has actually gained some traction.</p><p>On the other side, it has more than 2 billion users. A lot of people use it, a lot of even older people to see pictures of grandkids, people who have family members overseas. So, it doesn't go away so easily either.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Even to date, Lou, if you're on tinder and you most likely need a Facebook account, they kind of go hand-in-hand. It's so ingrained in our society.</p><p>LOUIS BASENESE, FOUNDER; DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Yes, it is. I think Facebook widely recognized long ago that they needed to have their tentacles into our lives across multiple platforms. And like Deirdre said, there's Instagram, there's Facebook Messenger. They found ways to make it much harder to delete Facebook.</p><p>And, you know, I would tell you, I think the biggest risk here, the Delete Facebook movement is definitely a risk, but the biggest risk here comes from advertisers. If they protest and bail en masse, then the business falls apart. And, you know, I think that's a low probability, ironically because Facebook's data on its users is so good and its scale is so big, over 2 billion users, advertisers aren't going to give up that marketing channel.</p><p>So, you know, look, I think we said this earlier in the week, Lauren, this, too, shall pass for Facebook, but this nightmare is far from over. There's going to be a lot of questions to be answered in uncomfortable situations for the CEO.</p><p>BOLTON: Indeed, and it's also a business problem as we've talked about, too, in the sense that Facebook has to decide are we actually going to spend more money to get human engineers who cost money, who want vacations, who want personal time? But they probably need to hire a lot of people to make sure that these data infractions aren't repeated.</p><p>I want a message as well or let you know about this message that we got from Cambridge Analytica. The acting CEO says the data that had been obtained from Facebook was in line with Facebook's term of service and data protection laws. So that's a pretty -- and basically, Cambridge Analytica is saying, hey, listen, we didn't do anything wrong. We were following the map, if you like, that Facebook set out.</p><p>BASENESE: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: So that's going to be one of the conversations that's continued, to your point Lou, in D.C. and Mark Zuckerberg, is going to have to, I mean, the New York A.G. has started an investigation, the Massachusetts A.G., has started an investigation.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I know.</p><p>BOLTON: Senators Thune, Nelson, saying, listen, Mark Zuckerberg, you need to come here to D.C., you need to tell us --</p><p>SIMONETTI: And overseas there are investigations resume --</p><p>BOLTON: -- the U.K.</p><p>SIMONETTI: The Dow just fell about 200 points. And typically, Lou, we've seen the big tech companies, the so-called fang stocks recovered pretty quickly when there's a big sell-off. We're not seeing that this time around. What do you make of that?</p><p>BASENESE: I'm not too concern of that, I think this is the trickle-down effects from the regulatory threats that are facing Facebook, right? You've already had some Congress representatives calling in potentially other CEOs from tech companies to talk about regulating their data. I mean, this is just turning into a short-term debacle for Facebook, and it's spilling over into the larger tech stocks.</p><p>I think if you want to look for protection, you've got to go somewhere into the small and micro cap land that are largely insulated from all of this. But right now, the headline of the day is going to be the breach of user trust and, you know, there's an old ancient Jewish scholar that once said, be careful, your sins will find you out. And Facebook is learning that the hard way right now. Like Cambridge, Deirdre just share, the Cambridge CEO has pointing their finger at Facebook saying, hey, we didn't do anything wrong, you're the one that originally sent here gave us access to the user data. And it's going to be really hard to restore trust when users know that that was given so freely.</p><p>SIMONETTI: One story that just is not going away because it implicates regulation and other companies as well. Lou, Deirdre, thank you so much for your perspective today.</p><p>BASENESE: Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And that is it for me, but you can watch me every weekday, 5 a.m. Eastern on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now, Ashley Webster is in for Liz Claman. And Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes. Here we go again.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Lock and load.</p><p>WEBSTER: TGIF.</p><p>SIMONETTI: There you go.</p><p>WEBSTER: But we had a big sell-off and here we are an hour to go before the bell rings that brings to the end, a very ugly week. Lauren Simonetti, thank you very much.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2018032301cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY3-8021-DXH2-61PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But Trump waved off any concerns that China would beat out the US in developing a next-generation 5G wireless network. \"China, as great as they are \u2014 and they are great \u2014 they don't have nearly the capability of our geniuses in Silicon Valley that walk around in undershirts, and they're worth $2 billion apiece,\" Trump told CNBC[6]. \"They don't have nearly the genius that these people have, and they practically admit it.\" Read more: The tech cold war: Everything that's happened in the new China-US tech conflict involving Google, Huawei, Apple, and Trump[7] The tech cold war between US and China[8] has maintained a fever pitch since the US barred American tech firms from working with Chinese companies like Huawei over concerns about state-sponsored spying and national security. Huawei told the US[9] that restricting its business would only harm US interests and cause the country to lag behind in deploying the 5G network. Most recently, Russia's largest network provider signed a deal with Huawei[10] to build 5G internet in 2019 and 2020. Nonetheless, Trump said Monday that the US would be \"leading very shortly\" in the race to implement 5G. The two countries have also duked it out by implementing heavy tariffs on each other's goods since March 2018. Last month, the US raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 25%[11]. Trump told CNBC on Monday that the hefty tariffs had successfully \"decimated\" China to help the US get the upper hand.

At the same time, he applauded internet provocateurs for their \"bad\" social media behavior.US President Donald Trump on Thursday used a White House meeting of far-right social media provocateurs to once more criticize big tech firms such as Twitter and Facebook for what he sees as their unfair treatment of conservative voices.\"We're not going to be silenced,\" Trump said. \"Big tech must not censor the voices.\"The US president has frequently claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that major internet companies, including his favored communications outlet, Twitter, are biased against him, even suggesting that US regulators should sue them for anti-conservative leanings.He announced on Thursday that his administration would explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\" </p><p>Read more: Is Facebook doing enough to combat fake news?'Genius, but bad'At the same time, Trump praised his guests at the \"social media summit\" \u2014 who did not include representatives of big tech firms \u2014 for their often extreme online behavior, while admitting that their presentations sometimes crossed the lines of accepted protocol.\"Some of you guys are out there \u2014 but even you should have a voice,\" he said. \"The crap you think of is unbelievable. I mean it's genius \u2014 but it's bad.\"Trump said such presentations were a way of getting around what he claims is misinformation spread by mainstream media.\"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter,\" he said.Read more: The politics of deleting online hate speech No evidence Trump's claim that mainstream social media platforms have employed tactics to censor conservative political views has yet to be borne out by concrete evidence, and the companies themselves have denied any anti-conservative bias. His criticism also seems at odds with his frequent and outspoken use of Twitter. \"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices, in particular, have used social media to great effect,\" the Internet Association, which represents Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said in a statement on Thursday.David Cicilline of Trump's own Republicans, who heads a House Judiciary subcommittee investigating the tech giants' market conduct, has also said he had found no evidence of their anti-conservative bias.\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday. \"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it.\"Although any censorship of mainstream conservative views has yet to be established, the big tech companies have been under recent pressure to ensure that their platforms are not used to disseminate extremist content. Twitter has banned hate speech targeting someone's race, gender and other categories, while Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory and fake news website Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the African-American political and religious movement Nation of Islam.tj/ng (AP, Reuters)DW sends out a daily selection of the day's news and features.

Both President Trump and Joe Biden have called for the end of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies in most cases when their users post something illegal on their platforms.</p><p><br/>Trump brought the subject up today when a Twitter account with fewer than 200 followers posted an obviously doctored image of Senate Majority Mitch McConnell dressed up in Soviety military garb, with the caption reading \"Moscow Mitch.\"<br/>\"Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true?\" the president wanted to know. \"Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!\"<br/>He then tagged Republican senators Marsha Blackburn and Josh Hawley, who reliably step up to lodge baseless complaints about systematic bias against their party whenever called upon. (In fact, they introduced something called \"the Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act\" on Tuesday, the point of which seems to be to stop social networks from doing so much moderating.)<br/>The reason Twitter (usually) leaves phony pictures like that up is that the United States permits its citizens to speak freely about politicians - even to say mean things about them. Repealing Section 230 would likely have no impact on the tweet in question, because the Twitter user's speech is protected under the First Amendment.<br/>It might, however, make Twitter legally liable for what its users post - which would lead the company to remove more speech, not less. Whatever repealing Section 230 might achieve, it would not be what the president seems to want.<br/>Anyway, all of this is well known to followers of the long-running Section 230 debates and seemingly impenetrable to everyone else. But if there's one important lesson from 2020, it's that long-running debates over expression can sometimes result in clumsy but decisive actions - ask TikTok! And so it's worth spending a few more minutes talking about what smarter people say ought to be done about Section 230.<br/>As it so happens, there's a sharp new report today out on the subject. Paul Barrett at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights looks at the origins and evolution of Section 230, evaluates both partisan and nonpartisan critiques, and offers a handful of solutions.<br/>To me there are two key takeaways from the report. One is that there are genuine, good-faith reasons to call for Section 230 reform, even though they're often drowned out by bad tweets that misunderstand the law. To me the one that lands the hardest is that Section 230 has allowed platforms to under-invest in content moderation in basically every dimension, and the cost of the resulting externalities has been borne by society at large.<br/>Ellen P. Goodman, a law professor at Rutgers University specializing in information policy, approaches the problem from another angle. She suggests that Section 230 asks for too little - nothing, really - in return for the benefit it provides. \"Lawmakers,\" she writes, \"could use Section 230 as leverage to encourage platforms to adopt a broader set of responsibilities.\" A 2019 report Goodman co-authored for the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business urges transforming Section 230 into \"a quid pro quo benefit.\" The idea is that platforms would have a choice: adopt additional duties related to content moderation or forgo some or all of the protections afforded by Section 230.<br/>The Stigler Center report provides examples of quids that larger platforms could offer to receive the quo of continued Section 230 immunity. One, which has been considered in the U.K. as part of that country's debate over proposed online-harm legislation, would \"require platform companies to ensure that their algorithms do not skew toward extreme and unreliable material to boost user engagement.\" Under a second, platforms would disclose data on what content is being promoted and to whom, on the process and policies of content moderation, and on advertising practices.<br/>This approach continues to enable lots of speech on the internet - you could keep those Moscow Mitch tweets coming - while forcing companies to disclose what they're promoting. Recommendation algorithms are the core difference between the big tech platforms and the open web that they have largely supplanted, and the world has a vested interest in understanding how they work and what results from their suggestions. I don't care much about a bad video with 100 views. But I care very much about a bad video with 10 million.<br/>So whose job will it be to pay attention to all this? Barrett's other suggestion is a kind of \"digital regulatory agency\" whose functions would mimic some combination of the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and similar agencies in other countries.<br/>It envisions the digital regulatory body - whether governmental or industry-based - as requiring internet companies to clearly disclose their terms of service and how they are enforced, with the possibility of applying consumer protection laws if a platform fails to conform to its own rules. The TWG emphasizes that the new regulatory body would not seek to police content; it would impose disclosure requirements meant to improve indirectly the way content is handled. This is an important distinction, at least in the United States, because a regulator that tried to supervise content would run afoul of the First Amendment. [...]<br/>In a paper written with Professor Goodman, Karen Kornbluh, who heads the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, makes the case for a Digital Democracy Agency devoted significantly to transparency. \"Drug and airline companies disclose things like ingredients, testing results, and flight data when there is an accident,\" Kornbluh and Goodman observe. \"Platforms do not disclose, for example, the data they collect, the testing they do, how their algorithms order news feeds and recommendations, political ad information, or moderation rules and actions.\" That's a revealing comparison and one that should help guide reform efforts.<br/>Nothing described here would really resolve the angry debate we have once or week or so in this country about a post that Facebook or Twitter or YouTube left up when they should have taken it down, or took down when they should have left it up. But it could pressure platforms to pay closer attention to what is going viral, what behaviors they are incentivizing, what harms all of that may be doing to the rest of us.<br/>And over time, the agency's findings could help lawmakers craft more targeted reforms to Section 230 - which is to say, reforms that are less openly hostile to the idea of free speech. Moscow Mitch will continue to have to take his lumps. But the platforms - at last - will have to take theirs, too.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1467075</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T8-1CH1-DYDW-70CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1183\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

On Monday, President Donald Trump threatened to retaliate against two beloved French exports: Champagne and cheese.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This latest global trade dispute pits Trump against a long-standing ally, months after France approved a \"digital services tax\" aimed at making major U.S.-based tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon fork over more revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issue had been on the backburner since August, after Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to a 90-day truce while they tried to reach a long-term agreement on how tech companies should be taxed. That deadline passed last week without a deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Monday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released results of an investigation that determined that France's tax unfairly discriminates against big U.S. tech companies.</p><p>If another solution isn't worked out, tech companies could pay hundreds of millions of more dollars in taxes and U.S. consumers would have have to pay double for Dom P\u00e9rignon, Le Creuset cookware and Roquefort cheese.</p><p>U.S officials also indicated they could investigate other European countries contemplating digital tax plans, putting them in cross-hairs of future tariff action if they follow through. They also said they were prepared to counter Europe's broader regulatory clampdown on American tech firms.</p><p>The latest salvo threatens to further strain relations with France and other European countries during this week's NATO meeting in London, which Trump is attending. With tensions rising, here's what you need to know about the tussle:</p><p>Why would the French start a tax war with tech companies?</p><p>Some European countries have been moaning for years about missed tax revenue from tech giants, many of which have hundreds of millions of users across the region but pay almost nothing into national coffers. Broader, digital tax proposals at the European Union went nowhere, so individual countries pushed ahead on their own.</p><p>France got there first: Lawmakers earlier this year passed a 3 percent digital services tax on any tech company with global revenues of more than (EURO)750 million, of which at least (EURO)25 million comes from French users. Countries including Spain, Austria and the United Kingdom have proposed similar rules, hoping to pocket a slice of the billions that some of Silicon Valley's biggest names generate each year.</p><p>Why is Trump sticking up for big tech companies?</p><p>It's complicated. He has repeatedly accused Twitter, Facebook and Google of censoring and suppressing conservative speech on their platforms, although evidence is lacking and the companies deny it.</p><p>Trump's most acrimonious tech relationship is with Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, whom he has repeatedly bashed on Twitter. The president's criticism is often related to coverage in the Bezos-owned Washington Post. He also has attacked Amazon for not paying state and local taxes, even though it has in recent years.</p><p>Trump champions some tech innovation, however, given its potential to grow the economy: The U.S. is a leader in robotics, driverless cars and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Trump has defended the tech industry on the international stage, most prominently by going after China for theft of American intellectual property. He also has lashed out at European regulators' antitrust and tax investigations of big tech companies, though his administration has launched similar probes.</p><p>His message seems to be: \"We can beat up on our own tech firms, but foreigners keep your hands off.\"</p><p>What do Champagne and cheese tariffs have to do with Facebook and Google?</p><p>Trump's chief trade official, Robert Lighthizer, is threatening France with 100 percent tariffs on up to $2.4 billion worth of French products - including Champagne, cheeses, handbags, soaps and fine dinnerware. He also said the U.S. could impose fees or restrictions on French services firms, such as banking and engineering companies, operating in the United States. The final tally of any retaliation is expected to reflect the estimated harm of the new digital services tax on U.S. companies.</p><p>Lighthizer is giving importers an opportunity to argue that certain items should be excluded from the duties. On the flip side, domestic manufacturers or farmers can push for other products to be slapped with tariffs.</p><p>Once a public comment period is all done, Lighthizer will issue a final list of goods and services subject to onerous tariffs, fees or restrictions. The measures stick until Trump is satisfied France has addressed U.S. concerns, either by modifying the tax or killing it.</p><p>Can Trump beat the French?</p><p>Trump is imposing the taxes using a provision known as \"Section 301,\" which Congress approved in 1974 as part of broader trade legislation. It allows the administration to retaliate against foreign trade moves that hurt U.S. companies.</p><p>The U.S. stopped using it after the nations agreed in the mid-1990s to create a global overseer of trade - the World Trade Organization - and its binding dispute-settlement system. But Trump has revived use of the 1974 law, even though it appears to be at odds with WTO rules against unilaterally raising tariffs. [The administration is separately undercutting the WTO's ability to settle disputes.]</p><p>When countries impose retaliation, including in those cases approved by the WTO, they try to hit products that will maximize pressure on their rivals to change policy. That's what Trump is doing by targeting French sparkling wine and cheese, while simultaneously giving a boost to domestic companies.</p><p>Why shouldn't tech companies pay their fair share in Europe?</p><p>The Trump administration says the tax is structured to punish large U.S. companies that are major players and spare French firms doing similar work on a much smaller scale. French policy makers fueled the perception with references to the new levy as a \"GAFA\" tax - short for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>The U.S. also worries a number of other countries, in search of new tax revenue, could follow France's lead. Even close trade allies like Canada have said they want to impose similar taxes. Some of the most successful U.S. companies could soon face a web of discriminatory taxes around the world, giving domestic competitors in each of those markets an advantage.</p><p>Additionally, the United States says France and others considering a digital services tax are intruding into an area where the U.S. has taxing rights, but they don't.</p><p>How does this end?</p><p>Discussions are taking place. In October, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of mostly rich nations, announced it would create a global set of rules to divvy up some of the profits created by the world's tech giants.</p><p>The hope is for an initial agreement in early 2020 about how individual countries can impose their own tax rules. Finance ministers representing the Group of 20 nations discussed in recent weeks the proposals that will require unanimous support.</p><p>Even the French and Americans have shown a willingness to work with each other, despite the ongoing threat of potential economic sanctions.</p><p>But with roughly six weeks to go before the OECD's self-imposed deadline to reach a worldwide agreement, any renewed tension between the U.S. and France could throw the yearslong negotiations into jeopardy.</p><p>Steven Overly and Aaron Lorenzo contributed to this report.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-074857</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN2-WHY1-JDJ6-K0JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><timeReceived>00:39Invalid date found for VDI: (VDI not available) XCEDOCID: 55 LNI: 5XN2-WHY1-JDJ6-K0JC-00000-00.

In an angry finger-tapping burst in two parts, Mr. Trump accused Google of skewing its search results against him:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative &amp; Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see. This is a very serious situation - will be addressed!\"</p><p>Will. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching Google News over and over again in the middle of the night.</p><p>But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.)</p><p>Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor.</p><p>Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note.</p><p>Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.</p><p>I can vaguely hear the always aggrieved tones of Mr. Trump's tech whisperer, the entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel, somewhere in there, who often goes on about having to move to ... wait for it ... <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Los Angeles</emphasis> to get away from the lefty groupthink in Northern California. While I am not going to be the one to tell him about those Hollywood types, it is extra rich since he became a billionaire via investing in all those supposed liberals, like those socialists over at Facebook.</p><p>That is obviously a joke, because, in fact, most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.</p><p>Otherwise, in my reporting, I have found that they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income and can't get enough of deregulation. Sure, they don't cotton to the anti-climate-change nonsense Mr. Trump spews and can't stand the endless bullying, but let's stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.</p><p>So whether it's the idea that Twitter \"shadow bans\" right-wing conservatives or that Facebook and YouTube have made a left-leaning decision that a vile and mendacious actor like the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones perhaps needs to be thrown off services for his vile and mendacious behavior, it's all codswallop.</p><p>You can look that fine word up on Google if you want to know what it means, by the way. That is also where you can also reach every single conservative, alt-right and white nationalistic site in a millisecond. And Google is just one platform of so many that have allowed every one of those voices to thrive and proliferate in untold - and in some cases, dangerous - ways.</p><p>It is certainly true that some of tech's egregious sins - like allowing malevolent actors to use their platforms malevolently or disadvantaging smaller start-ups from innovating, which might be covered in Senate hearings next week where top Facebook, Google and Twitter leaders are expected to appear - need to be addressed by some sort of regulation to come.</p><p>But stifling even vile human speech is not one of them. It's hard to make tech giants sympathetic, but Mr. Trump has managed to pull it off with cloddish aplomb with nearly every accusation of their being unfair in this regard.</p><p>Last week, for example, he tweeted: \"Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people ... People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!\"</p><p>But it's been Mr. Trump who has led the truth-isn't-truth team that has tried its best to obfuscate facts by using social media to unleash so many lies that it drowns out all else. And it's probably no surprise that conservatives made such good use of digital tools, having most definitely been largely left out in the wilderness of the old media equation for decades until Fox News arrived on the scene.</p><p>Tech has, in fact, been very, very good for conservatives from the get-go and very much so for Mr. Trump and his minions, as his 2016 digital media director and current 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, well knows.</p><p>And while I kind of get Mr. Trump's demented tirades against what he calls the \"Amazon Washington Post\" - largely because its chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, utterly ignores the goofy smacks, even as the retail giant only grows in size and power - keeping tech free to do whatever it wants is beneficial for him.</p><p>It's certainly not good for most of the rest of us, who have to wade through the ever-growing digital muck on a daily basis to utilize what is actually good about it. (It's pretty much down to the game Fortnite and meditation apps now.)</p><p>What's most interesting about the coarsening of the digital media landscape, which Mr. Trump has truly been an \"innoventor\" of (yeah, that is a term used in Silicon Valley) - is that it has had a discernibly bad impact on the very platform that he has used so well.</p><p>That would be Twitter. And rather than being boosted by the Twit in chief and the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to him, usage on the platform has continued to fall. In its last earnings report, the company said it had lost one million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.</p><p>While that is a result of a number of management snafus that have gone on since forever, it is also about the inability to clean up all the mess it has allowed to morph. Which is to say letting a thousand flowers bloom, despite the fact that far too many of them stink and more still are troublemaking bots.</p><p>That has meant that Twitter and other social media platforms have since become so much of a toxic swamp that it is now probably impossible to clean most of it up.</p><p>As one social media executive said to me recently, with an audible sigh: \"For one set, we can't take enough down; for another set, we can't leave up enough. One side thinks social media enabled populism, while the other thinks the opposite. There will be no fixing this.\"</p><p>Which makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr. Trump, even though he seems to not be in on the giant tech joke he has created.</p><p>In an interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mark Leibovich of The New York Times about a year ago, that much was clear.</p><p>\"They want to take away my voice,'' Mr. Trump declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his @realDonaldTrump handle (along with 23 million more on @potus). ''They're not going to take away my social media.\"</p><p>No, Mr. President, they're not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006077477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T58-JMC1-JC85-N120-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 31, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In an angry finger-tapping burst in two parts, Mr. Trump accused Google of skewing its search results against him:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cGoogle search results for \u2018Trump News\u2019 shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative &amp; Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on \u2018Trump News\u2019 are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see. This is a very serious situation \u2014 will be addressed!\u201d</p><p>Will. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching Google News over and over again in the middle of the night.</p><p>But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.)</p><p>Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor.</p><p>Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note.</p><p>Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.</p><p>I can vaguely hear the always aggrieved tones of Mr. Trump\u2019s tech whisperer, the entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel, somewhere in there, who often goes on about having to move to \u2026 wait for it \u2026 Los Angeles to get away from the lefty groupthink in Northern California. While I am not going to be the one to tell him about those Hollywood types, it is extra rich since he became a billionaire via investing in all those supposed liberals, like those socialists over at Facebook.</p><p>That is obviously a joke, because, in fact, most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.</p><p>Otherwise, in my reporting, I have found that they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income and can\u2019t get enough of deregulation. Sure, they don\u2019t cotton to the anti-climate-change nonsense Mr. Trump spews and can\u2019t stand the endless bullying, but let\u2019s stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.</p><p>So whether it\u2019s the idea that Twitter \u201cshadow bans\u201d right-wing conservatives or that Facebook and YouTube have made a left-leaning decision that a vile and mendacious actor like the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones perhaps needs to be thrown off services for his vile and mendacious behavior, it\u2019s all codswallop.</p><p>You can look that fine word up on Google if you want to know what it means, by the way. That is also where you can also reach every single conservative, alt-right and white nationalistic site in a millisecond. And Google is just one platform of so many that have allowed every one of those voices to thrive and proliferate in untold \u2014 and in some cases, dangerous \u2014 ways.</p><p>It is certainly true that some of tech\u2019s egregious sins \u2014 like allowing malevolent actors to use their platforms malevolently or disadvantaging smaller start-ups from innovating, which might be covered in Senate hearings next week where top Facebook, Google and Twitter leaders are expected to appear \u2014 need to be addressed by some sort of regulation to come.</p><p>But stifling even vile human speech is not one of them. It\u2019s hard to make tech giants sympathetic, but Mr. Trump has managed to pull it off with cloddish aplomb with nearly every accusation of their being unfair in this regard.</p><p>Last week, for example, he tweeted: \u201cSocial Media Giants are silencing millions of people \u2026 People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s been Mr. Trump who has led the truth-isn\u2019t-truth team that has tried its best to obfuscate facts by using social media to unleash so many lies that it drowns out all else. And it\u2019s probably no surprise that conservatives made such good use of digital tools, having most definitely been largely left out in the wilderness of the old media equation for decades until Fox News arrived on the scene.</p><p>Tech has, in fact, been very, very good for conservatives from the get-go and very much so for Mr. Trump and his minions, as his 2016 digital media director and current 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, well knows.</p><p>And while I kind of get Mr. Trump\u2019s demented tirades against what he calls the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d \u2014 largely because its chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, utterly ignores the goofy smacks, even as the retail giant only grows in size and power \u2014 keeping tech free to do whatever it wants is beneficial for him.</p><p>It\u2019s certainly not good for most of the rest of us, who have to wade through the ever-growing digital muck on a daily basis to utilize what is actually good about it. (It\u2019s pretty much down to the game Fortnite and meditation apps now.)</p><p>What\u2019s most interesting about the coarsening of the digital media landscape, which Mr. Trump has truly been an \u201cinnoventor\u201d of (yeah, that is a term used in Silicon Valley) \u2014 is that it has had a discernibly bad impact on the very platform that he has used so well.</p><p>That would be Twitter. And rather than being boosted by the Twit in chief and the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to him, usage on the platform has continued to fall. In its last earnings report, the company said it had lost one million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.</p><p>While that is a result of a number of management snafus that have gone on since forever, it is also about the inability to clean up all the mess it has allowed to morph. Which is to say letting a thousand flowers bloom, despite the fact that far too many of them stink and more still are troublemaking bots.</p><p>That has meant that Twitter and other social media platforms have since become so much of a toxic swamp that it is now probably impossible to clean most of it up.</p><p>As one social media executive said to me recently, with an audible sigh: \u201cFor one set, we can\u2019t take enough down; for another set, we can\u2019t leave up enough. One side thinks social media enabled populism, while the other thinks the opposite. There will be no fixing this.\u201d</p><p>Which makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr. Trump, even though he seems to not be in on the giant tech joke he has created.</p><p>In an interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mark Leibovich of The New York Times about a year ago, that much was clear.</p><p>\u201cThey want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his @realDonaldTrump handle (along with 23 million more on @potus). \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u201d</p><p>No, Mr. President, they\u2019re not. </p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by Jeffrey Henson Scales, photographs by Tom Brenner for The New York Times, and

Kamala Harris, who demanded the president's Twitter account be shut down.</p><p>Zuckerberg, 35, said: \"Political speech is one of the most scrutinised [forms of] speech that is out there, so that's already happening.</p><p>\"Our position on this is not an outlier.\"</p><p>Ahead of Friday's TV interview, Zuckerberg gave a 35-minute speech at Georgetown University on Thursday - an event that prevented journalists from asking questions and barred organizations from filming.</p><p>Only students were allowed to ask questions, and many individuals online pointed out the irony of hosting a talk about free speech but not allowing reporters to fully cover it.</p><p>To make his case for free speech on the platform, Zuckerberg referenced the likes of Martin Luther King, the Vietnam War and the First Amendment.</p><p>                                            FAKE POLITICAL ADS                                        </p><p>The Facebook founder also addressed the issue of fake political ads - a topic of contention that has only been amplified by the actions and comments of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's in recent weeks.</p><p>Warren, a leading Democratic candidate who is competing against Harris, ran a fake political ad on the social network as a means of targeting its CEO.</p><p>Through the ad, Warren, who has talked about breaking up big tech companies, looked to protest Facebook's decision not to fact-check its politicians speech or ads - an approach the social media giant takes with news stories and other posts.</p><p>Ahead of Thursday's speech, Warren had dubbed Facebook a \"disinformation-for-profit machine.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg, responding to the fact-checking issue, said: \"We think people should be able to see for themselves.</p><p>\"If content is newsworthy, we don't take it down even if it goes against our standards.\"</p><p>However, several students pointed out Facebook's fact-checking policies on articles tend to have an anti-conservative bias, while others stated that not fact-checking political ads could, in fact, favour conservatives.</p><p>Following the Georgetown speech, Zuckerberg continue to come under fire from all angles.</p><p>Bill Russo, a spokesman for the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joseph R.

And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting are Turning Point USA, the Washington think-tank Heritage Foundation and PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly levelled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the U.S. industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members'platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said: \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the leadup to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VICTTC-395342191VITC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VICTTC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHY-G291-DY2T-136Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">249804</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Colonist All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>HERITAGE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump narrowly won these states in 2016 - and they will be crucial for his path to winning a second term.</p><p>\"The president does not believe California is in play, but there is surprisingly a decent pot of money in fundraising in the state,\" said one close White House adviser. \"The same people who gave to his campaign have a list of problems they have with the state, and they're running up against a Democratic state legislature while looking for creative solutions.\"</p><p>Trump is more than happy to listen to their concerns at roundtables and private dinners and lunches. Trump supporter and California attorney Harmeet Dhillon said the president's message to California-based donors this week behind closed doors included discussions of rising property crime, immigration and homelessness in San Francisco.</p><p>The four fundraisers Trump attended in Los Angeles, San Diego, Beverly Hills and the San Francisco area netted $15 million for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee made up of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, said one Republican official familiar with the events.</p><p>Trump's donor base in California is bigger than one would presume for a blue state, even if many of its donors would prefer to remain under-the-radar given Trump's divisiveness. In 2016, between May and the November election, the Trump campaign and the RNC took in roughly $11.2 million in donations of at least $5,000 or more from California residents, according to data from the Federal Election Commission. </p><p>That included donations from Steven Mnuchin, who worked on the Trump campaign and later became Treasury Secretary, and Tom Barrack, Trump's longtime billionaire friend currently under investigation by federal prosecutors.</p><p>In late 2018 and 2019, Trump's support from California Republicans comes from real estate industry executives, players in California's huge agricultural sector - long a supporter of and geographic home to California Republicans - and technology executives who have broken with the industry's generally liberal bent.</p><p>This includes Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and an entrepreneur, as well as donors who are not household names, including: Geoffrey H. Palmer, a real estate developer; Barbara M. Grimm-Marshall, owner of Grimmway Farms; entrepreneur Jarrett Streebin; and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, according to Federal Election Commission records.</p><p>Two close advisers to the White House said the Trump campaign always raises the majority of its money from donors in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, given the wealth in the four states.</p><p>Trump's attention to California-specific issues helps make donors feel heard, they added, especially since Trump has never been able to tap into establishment Republican money in any meaningful way in states like Connecticut, Massachusetts or New Jersey.</p><p>The Trump campaign also intends to continue to elevate the state as a cautionary example for what it considers an overly liberal government run amok, compared to the #MAGA worldview Trump has created. The campaign is casting California as socialism on steroids, with the state suddenly the president's favorite political foil. </p><p>Democrats control more than two-thirds of the California Legislature while Republicans have fallen to third in voter registration, trailing independents. Even longtime GOP bastions such as Orange County have turned blue, a major reason Republicans hold only seven of the state's 53 seats in Congress.</p><p>\"There is a growing sense that California is just out of control,\" said Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House and a longtime friend of Trump's who serves as an informal political adviser. \"The president is ultimately going to run a campaign of contrasts. The party that cannot fix Baltimore also cannot fix San Francisco and cannot fix the homeless problem there. He is looking for opportunities to draw the contrast between the two Americas, and I think it is greatly to the left's disadvantage.\"</p><p>Trump certainly played up that theme during his visit.</p><p>On Air Force One during the ride back to Washington D.C., he announced the Environmental Protection Agency would soon give San Francisco a notice of environmental violations related to its homelessness problem. The president said pollution was flowing into the ocean in California because of waste in storm sewers caused by objects like used needles. </p><p>\"It's a terrible situation - that's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\" he said on the plane. \"We can't have our cities going to hell.\"</p><p>\"The President is underlining the failure of liberal leadership in major cities, in California and elsewhere, to draw a contrast with the success of his own policies. And the success of his fundraising in California is evidence that there are millions of Golden State residents who enthusiastically support his re-election,\" said Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the president's re-election campaign.</p><p>\"It is also important for California Republicans to stay engaged, because there are a number of House seats we can regain with President Trump's help at the top of the ticket,\" Murtaugh added.</p><p>Attorney Dhillon, who rode with Trump in his motorcade in California and had previously attended a White House social media summit enlisting conservative voices, rejected the notion that Trump was \"retaliating\" against California's Democratic leaders.</p><p>\"I think there's a lot of interest here despite the one-party rule\" in what the president has to say, added Dhillon. </p><p>The president also always loves a good foil - from the New York Times to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to state political figures and business leaders in the nation's most populous and arguably bluest state.</p><p>\"There are a lot of bogeyman who reside in California,\" joked one source close to the campaign about the president's most recent visit. \"You have Big Tech and Hollywood,\" giving the president ammunition for Twitter, rallies, and his 2020 re-election bid.</p><p>Scott Bland contributed reporting.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1505636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-WCK1-JDJ6-K01T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><timeReceived>11:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favored means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.</p><p>But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.</p><p>Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that \"if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.\" He said market pressures can produce positive changes.</p><p>Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. \"I think there will be some form of equilibrium\" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-center views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said Tuesday. \"Hopefully these companies can self-correct.\"</p><p>\"Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020\" based largely on information from social media, Kirk said.</p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter \"are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.\"</p><p>Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, \"Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.\"</p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn't know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, \"I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias.\"</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

The 'Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship[1]' directs federal agencies to re-examine the protections of Sec. 230 to ensure they are not being abused by 'platforms that \u2014 far from acting in 'good faith' to remove objectionable content \u2014 instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree.' </p><p>Trump's action immediately drew condemnation on the Right from both conservatives and libertarians, who claimed it was government overreach[2], regulating a private company[3], and burning down free speech[4] on the internet. There is a lot of hyperbole and many straw man arguments surrounding this debate, as well as legitimate concerns about free speech online. Here are a few things to consider. First, since the passage of Sec. 230 in 1996, the government has been well entangled with the tech industry. In fact, the provision of law is central to their business model. The Sec. 230 debate generates so much light and heat not only because it governs speech online; it is the billion-dollar provision of law that has grown these companies from basement start-ups to industry giants. As one pro-Section 230 law professor put it[5], Sec. 230 amounts to an 'implicit financial subsidy' to Internet companies. These are private companies, yes, but their success or failure is built on the back of specific treatment by the government. Second, that treatment is in some ways necessary. The immunity provided by Sec. 230 prevents these companies from being sued into oblivion for taking down smutty content, child pornography, or other content the law defines as 'obscene, lewd, lascivious' and so on. It applies broadly not just to tech companies (though those are its most famous beneficiaries), but to the comments sections of online newspapers and sites across the web.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) As described[6] by former Republican California Rep. Chris Cox, one of the provision's authors, the provision was intended to 'help clean up the Internet' by protecting companies who wanted to engage in good-faith removal of the nastiness that can flourish online. But the modern application of Sec. 230 today is not what it was in 1996. Over the past 24 years, aggressive litigation has contorted the statute, broadening the immunity well beyond efforts to 'clean up the Internet.' For example, thanks to Sec. 230, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals did not hold[7] the dating app Grindr liable for failing to respond to repeated requests to remove fake posts that resulted in the harassment and harm[8] of a user. Sec. 230 also gives social media companies tremendous power to remove, block and filter user content based on their own policies \u2014 including, as we recently saw, tweets[9] from both the White House and the president of the United States. This gets to the crux of the issue: the power of private tech companies to control speech in the public square-not to mention their tremendous power over your data, privacy, behavior, and elections. The text, reach, and application of President Trump's executive order is less about the technical merits of Sec. 230 than it is a proxy for that question. The arrogance of tech companies in blatantly imposing political viewpoints, crushing small business, serially violating user privacy[10], and acknowledging their power over election outcomes[11] has come home to roost. Seventy-two percent of the public[12]thinks it's likely that social media platforms actively censor political views that those companies find objectionable. 77%[13] of Americans think big tech has too much power. Sec. 230 expert Jeff Kossof recently remarked[14] that the tech companies have 'proceeded for years basically treating Section 230 like it's a right that's enshrined in the Constitution and now what you're seeing is a backlash to that arrogance.' The amount of Sec. 230 reform proposals proliferating[15] in Congress demonstrates that it's not just President Trump who thinks the law might need some updates. As recently as 2018, Congress amended Sec. 230 to remove liability protections for sites that knowingly assisted in sex trafficking. (Some tech groups even fought that law[16] on the basis of its potential harm to free speech.) Ultimately, it is Congress which has the power to change the law, though it will be up to the courts to decide if President Trump can interpret its application, as the Executive Order attempts to do. Everyone wants to ensure free speech online \u2014 indeed, much of the frustration from the president and his allies comes from a belief that free speech is being curtailed. Sec. 230 presents both opportunities and hazards to that end, and is just one of a handful of policy options lawmakers are considering, in addition to robust antitrust enforcement[17] and privacy legislation. As much as the tech industry and its advocates might not think this debate should happen, it's clear that both lawmakers and a plurality of Americans do. Trump's executive order is a clear sign that this debate is only just beginning.
