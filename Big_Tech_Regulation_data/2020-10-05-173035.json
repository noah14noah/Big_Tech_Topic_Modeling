Brussels is hoping to set global standards for the digital economy and to tackle the entrenched advantages enjoyed by Big Tech. </p><p>Earlier this month, Thierry Breton, the French commissioner for the internal market, told the Financial Times that the EU was preparing a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7738fdd8-e0c3-4090-8cc9-7d4b53ff3afb\"> blacklist of behaviours</url> that so-called gatekeeper platforms would be forced to eradicate from their business practices.</p><p>In February, Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice-president in charge of regulating Big Tech, warned that dominant players <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5c7b640-526c-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\"> would be forced to open up their data</url> to smaller competitors.</p><p>The draft of the regulation is an early indication that Brussels has committed the ideas to paper and shows that regulators are squaring up for a battle with Silicon Valley. </p><p>Tech giants are likely to be rocked by the scale of the EU\u2019s ambitions of curbing companies\u2019 powers, with 30 paragraphs of prohibitions or obligations.</p><p>Other parts of the draft include a rule that so-called gatekeeper platforms, those companies that wield huge power because they run the sites or marketplaces that others use to do business, should only be able to use the data they collect for narrow purposes. </p><p>\u201cGatekeepers shall not use data received from business users for advertising services for any other purpose other than advertising services,\u201d the draft seen by the Financial Times said.</p><p>The draft suggests that Big Tech may be banned from preferential treatment of their own services on their sites or platforms, to the detriment of rivals, and that companies should not be allowed to pre-install their own applications on hardware devices, such as laptops or phones, or force other companies to exclusively pre-install their software. </p><p>Separately, Brussels wants large platforms to let users uninstall any pre-installed apps on devices such as smartphones and personal computers, according to the draft, which is in its early stages.</p><p>Regulators are keen to reshape the rules of the digital economy after accusations that online platforms were \u201ctoo big to care\u201d, with antitrust cases often lasting for years without palatable concessions to improve competition in the bloc.</p><p>But they are likely to face pushback from the tech companies. In its submission to the Digital Services Act, Google suggested that existing rules should be modernised rather than \u201cturning to consideration of new and distinct regulatory frameworks\u201d. </p><p>It added that regulators should not rush to define certain companies as gatekeepers. \u201cIn certain sectors, the platform may have market power; in others, it may be a new entrant or marginal player. The digital ecosystem is extremely diverse and evolving rapidly and it would be misguided for gatekeeper designations to be evaluated by reference to the position of an entire company or corporate group,\u201d it said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-1773edd67f1d429093b605965a4ff0db</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YH-9NS1-JB77-K005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 30, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Three European Commission internal documents, seen by POLITICO, indicate that Brussels is drawing up...</p><p>The EU is preparing for its biggest-ever effort to regulate the tech industry \u2014 drawing up extensive rules to govern what tech companies can and cannot do.    Three European Commission internal documents, seen by POLITICO, indicate that Brussels is drawing up a wide range of legislative tools to prohibit what it sees as anti-competitive behavior and oblige companies to do more to protect their users against illegal content and activities.        \"This crisis has shown the role and the systemic character of certain platforms that often behave as if they were too big to care about legitimate concerns about their roles: too big to care,\" Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told the European Parliament this week, an apparent reference to \"too big to fail,\" a criticism leveled at powerful banks after the 2008 financial crisis.    The Commission is expected to present its proposals, known collectively as the Digital Services Act (DSA), in December. The legislative package will include content moderation requirements applying to a wide range of online platforms, as well as so-called ex-ante rules for the largest tech companies.    The plans come as Big Tech companies are under intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.    Apple and Amazon are currently under investigation by Brussels' competition authorities, while Google has already been slapped with three antitrust fines, including for favoring its own services over those of rivals and making unfair use of its Android operating system to maintain its dominance in online search. (The company has appealed.)    In Washington, the House of Representatives is expected to release Monday a long-awaited antitrust report on competition in the tech sector, after the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook were grilled by skeptical U.S. lawmakers over the summer.    Some of the Commission's draft provisions include preventing those companies from favoring their own services on their platforms and from exclusively pre-installing their apps on operating systems, according to a draft list of banned behavior.   Gatekeepers' rules   As part of the package, the Commission is drafting ex-ante rules to regulate the biggest tech companies. Instead of waiting for competition complaints and cases to ask for remedies, the future legislation would instead impose obligations on companies on the basis of being \"gatekeepers,\" meaning they are indispensable for other companies to reach consumers and get market access online.    While the rules are expected to target Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, a draft impact assessment showed that cloud giants such as Microsoft could also fall under the scope.        \"Due to the 'winner-take-all' dynamics of the platform economy, big online platforms have grown and gained gatekeeper power,\" reads the Commission's impact assessment on the future rules. \"Gatekeepers raise important concerns since they have the ability to, and do engage in harmful trading practices. These practices affect both their business users and competitors.\"    For example, Apple is facing complaints from Epic Games, which runs the popular video game Fortnite, and Swedish music-streaming platform Spotify over its App Store's policies. Epic complained about the store's payment system, and Spotify accuses Apple of favoring its own Apple Music, which it is in direct competition with.    In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon, which both hosts sellers on its online marketplace and competes with them, used rivals' data to enhance its own wares. Amazon denies the charge, saying that doing so goes against its own rules.        The Commission hasn't yet decided on the best option to deal with gatekeeper platforms, but it is considering a blacklist of banned behavior and a whitelist of obligations in four \"key services\": app stores, marketplaces and social networks, which all come under \u201conline intermediation services;\" online search engines; operating systems; and cloud services.    Besides the likely bans on self-preferencing and exclusive pre-installation of their own apps on operating systems such as Apple's iOS or Android, gatekeeper companies could be prevented from using data collected on their platforms for their own commercial activities unless they also share them with their business users, and have stricter obligations to notify authorities of future mergers and acquisitions.    The Commission also refers to a \u201cgray list,\u201d which lists behaviors regulators would be empowered to prohibit. It includes a ban on restricting the use of business users\u2019 data and a ban on proposing different prices for similar services if one of them is operated by the gatekeeper, among others.   More transparency   The Commission will also update a decades-old law, known as the e-Commerce Directive, that regulates how companies deal with illegal content online. Countries such as Germany and France have in recent years come up with their own legislation on content moderation, prompting fears in Brussels that the bloc's single market would become increasingly fragmented.    Under the current EU law, online platforms are not legally responsible for illegal material but are obliged to remove it once it's been flagged.    According to another impact assessment focused on content moderation, that provision will stay, but the Commission will require tech companies to be more transparent on how it moderates content. The bill will likely impose \"due diligence obligations [such as] notice and action;\" to know which businesses use their platforms; to be transparent about their paid advertising and recommender systems \u2014 the algorithm that automatically recommends new content to users; and to cooperate with authorities.    The European Parliament has also pressured the Commission by calling for more transparency on how illegal and harmful content is spread, and requiring more transparency for recommender systems.    Further, the Commission wants \"enhanced obligations for very large online platforms\" such as access to their data and audit requirements and to \"remove disincentives for platforms to take action,\" meaning platforms proactively removing illegal content should not be made liable for it \u2014 known in U.S. law as a Good Samaritan principle.    When it comes to enforcement, the draft suggests appointing a central \"coordinator\" in each EU country, as well as an EU board and secretariat.

Caramello Alvarez[5] Alessandro Di Mario[6] K...ates[7] K...ates HUB[8] ANTITRUST AND COMPETITIONEU Competition Commissioner Vestager Will Also Be Responsible For Coordinating The EU Digital Agenda Last month, Margrethe Vestager was confirmed as Competition Commissioner for the next five years. In addition, she has been given the role of Executive Vice-President of the Commission, responsible for coordinating the overall digital agenda for the EU.Vestager's additional role clearly indicates that the Commission's enforcement will increasingly focus on digital markets. This is in line with the approach taken so far by Vestager, whose previous mandate has been marked by a number of high-profile investigations against big tech companies. Over the past five years, a major search engine company has been fined three times by the Commission, most recently in March 2019, for alleged abusive practices in online advertising. </p><p>In December 2019, the Commission opened a preliminary investigation into the way two major tech companies are gathering, processing, using, and monetizing users' data, including for advertising purposes. The Commission also is investigating whether a major online platform has misused sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace in breach of EU competition rules.Vestager will also have a broader set of tools allowing her to tackle issues in the digital sector on different fronts. Notably, she will be in charge of coordinating Europe's position on digital taxation.The choice to entrust Vestager with the responsibility for coordinating the EU digital agenda indicates that there will be a closer relationship between competition enforcement and regulatory policy in the digital sector, notably with respect to platforms. Regarding platforms activities, Vestager recently indicated 'how we will handle that, we have not started formulating yet. But that is on our working schedule.'Whilst large tech companies' behavior will remain under close scrutiny, the current EU competition rules are likely to be refined and adapted to the challenges of the digital era. Indeed, the Commission's Mission Letter to Vestager states that she 'will evaluate and review Europe's competition rules' as well as 'consider using the tool of sector inquiries into new and emerging markets that are shaping our economy and society.' Digitalization is likely to be a focus, as Vestager indicated last December the need to keep 'the rulebook up to date' with respect to digital markets. United Kingdom's Competition Authority Publishes Interim Digital Report On December 18, 2019, the UK Competition and Markets Authority ('CMA') published an update ('Interim Report') of its examination of online platforms and digital advertising.Building up on the findings of the so-called Furman's report, the CMA especially expressed a concern that certain digital platforms have grown so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms. Based on its findings, the CMA concluded in the Interim Report that there is a strong argument for the development of a new regulatory regime. Such regime could focus on changing the behavior of online platforms via an enforceable code of conduct for platforms with strategic market status. Platforms with such strategic market status should thus be subject to three overarching principles: fair trading, open choices, and trust and transparency.The fair trading principle would require the platform to trade on fair and reasonable terms for services where they are an unavoidable trading partner because of their market position.The open choices principle would require the platform to allow users to choose freely between elements of the platform's services and those offered by competitors, thus introducing interoperability.Finally, the trust and transparency principle would aim to ensure that platforms provide sufficient information to users, including both consumers and businesses that transact with the platform.Moreover, the Interim Report also envisages specific interventions aimed to address the sources of market power as well as barriers to entry and expansion. These interventions include data access and interoperability remedies, measures to give consumers greater control over their data, enabling switching and multi-homing, and separation remedies.The CMA is currently consulting on the Interim Report ahead of publishing its final version by July 2, 2020. The CMA welcomes stakeholders' input by February 12, 2020.At this stage, the CMA is expecting that the most likely outcome of the process will be recommendations to the UK government on how to regulate the digital sector. In the meantime, the CMA expressed its continued readiness to intervene directly with its own powers if potentially problematic issues are not addressed, whether domestically or internationally. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AFFAIRSIOSCO Launches Framework For Monitoring Leverage In Funds On December 13, 201, the International Organization of Securities Commissions ('IOSCO') issued a report outlining recommendations on a two-step framework assessing leverage in investment funds. The initiative is a follow up to a Financial Stability Board Recommendation requesting from IOSCO to develop consistent measures of leverage in funds to facilitate more meaningful monitoring of leverage for financial stability purposes.The framework proposed by IOSCO aims at achieving a balance between precise leverage measures and simple robust metrics that can be applied to the wide range of funds offered in different jurisdictions. The framework enhances proportionality taking into account that not all funds threaten financial stability due to their regulatory and legal characteristics.In the first step, the framework addresses how regulators identify the funds that could pose financial stability risks through using Gross Notional Exposure or adjusted Gross Notional Exposure. In this context, IOSCO characterizes these metrics as baseline analytical tools, underlying their susceptibility to overstate a fund's exposure and not excluding funds that are unlikely to yield financial stability risks. In the second step, a risk-based analysis of the funds identified in the first step will be performed, giving regulators the leeway to determine their approach towards conducting the funds' risk assessment.To this respect, IOSCO puts forward a set of risk factors\u2014counterparty, market, liquidity\u2014to be considered by regulators in their risk analysis.In this context, IOSCO, based on the data available by regulators pursuant to its recommendations, will publish an annual report reflecting leverage trends within the asset management industry at a global level. The first report is scheduled for release in 2021. CONSUMER PROTECTIONBooking.Com Commits To Align Practices Presenting Offers And Prices With EU Law Following a dialogue with the European Commission and national consumer protection authorities, Booking.com has made a number of commitments to change the way they present offers, discounts and prices to consumers, in order to align with the requirements of EU consumer law.By June 16, 2020, Booking.com will make several changes in their practices designed to increase the platform's transparency towards consumers. The changes mainly concern the way that information will be displayed on the platform. The objectives are to clarify the expiry of available offers, the ranking of results and the criteria for price comparison. The changes shall also involve displaying the total price that the consumer will have to pay, including all fees and taxes that can be reasonably calculated in advance, as well as whether an accommodation is offered by a private or a professional host.In terms of next steps, the competent national authorities will review the implementation of these commitments, independently of any other assessment of compliance with consumer law principles that could be raised in the context of national proceedings. Under the supervision of the European Commission, the national authorities will continue to assess other major online travel services platforms practices.This procedure results from the collaboration between enforcement authorities under the current Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation ('CPC Regulation'). Importantly, a new CPC Regulation will be applicable as of January 17, 2020, under which national authorities of the European Economic Area countries (EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) are expected to further extend their cooperation to jointly address consumer law infringements in the internal market. The new CPC Regulation will allow national authorities to tackle new areas such as short duration infringements or misleading advertising campaigns. Its purpose is also to strengthen competences of national authorities in order to ease cross-border cooperation and deal with bad online practices more efficiently. INSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRSThe Croatian Presidency Of The EU Outlines Its Priorities From January 1 to June 30, 2020, Croatia will preside over the Council of the EU for the first time since it joined the EU in 2013. During this six-month period, Croatia will set the agenda of the Council and lead the work of the institution that, together with the European Parliament, adopts EU law. The challenges the new Presidency is called to face include in particular Brexit and the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021 - 2027, which Croatia intends to advance. Croatia, taking over from the Finnish Presidency, will work around four main sets of priorities, which it has defined as 'a Europe that develops, a Europe that connects, a Europe that protects and an influential Europe'. A Europe That Develops Under this broad goal, the Croatian Presidency aims to boost a balanced regional development by reducing economic disparities among Member States, reinforcing the Economic and Monetary Union and ensuring a uniform quality of products throughout the single market. To achieve these objectives, a number of legislative proposals may feature in the coming months, in particular: the Directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral; the Regulation on the EU Sovereign Bond-backed Securities and the Regulation to establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme.In line with the European Commission's priorities, the Croatian Presidency intends to improve environmental protection and fight climate change by advancing discussions on a green Europe and, through the implementation of the Paris Agreement, help transition to a low carbon and circular economy. To do so, the proposals on a Regulation on the framework to facilitate sustainable investment, a Regulation establishing a programme for the environment and climate action and a Regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse are the prominent pieces of legislation that the Presidency plans to push through the legislative machinery.Furthermore, the Croatian Presidency plans to strengthen the competitiveness of European industry, including small and medium enterprises, deepen the single market and promote the digitalization of business. To this end, the following pending proposals could be negotiated: the Regulation to establish a Programme for single market competitiveness of enterprises, including SMEs and European statistics 2021-2027; the Regulation establishing Horizon Europe - the Framework programme for research and innovation 2021-2027; and the Regulation establishing the Digital Europe Programme 2021-2027. A Europe That Connects With the aim of further developing a networked economy and exploiting its full potential, Croatia proposes to boost a Single European Transport Area through dedicated funds for the construction of infrastructure networks and the innovation and digitalization of all branches of the transport sector. The following proposals fall under this remit: the Directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures; the Directive on the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road; and the Directive on the establishment of common rules for certain types of combined transport of goods between Member States.Moreover, Croatia announced it will focus on the improvement of the quality and security of data infrastructure by creating the conditions for the full deployment of 5G networks, and expressed its intention to deepen the integration of the energy market by fostering the Energy Union. A Europe That Protects To ensure the security of EU citizens, Croatia plans to improve the effectiveness of controls over external borders, enhance the interoperability of IT systems in the area of justice and home affairs, and strengthen resilience against malicious cyber activities. Some of the proposals relevant to achieve these objectives are the Regulation on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online; the Regulation concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications; and the Regulation on establishing the Internal Security Fund. An Influential Europe Finally, to face global challenges, the new Presidency promotes the vision of a 'leading role for the EU on a global scale'. However, it does not specify which measures it intends to adopt to achieve such an objective, besides strengthening multilateralism, cooperation with third countries and promoting enlargement as well as neighbourhood policy, especially with the Western Balkans. INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CUSTOMS, AND EXTERNAL RELATIONSEurope Proposes Aggressive Action Amid WTO Tensions Against a backdrop of heightened global tensions over international trade, the European Commission unveiled a proposal for a regulation that would allow the EU to protect its trade interests despite the paralysis of the WTO's Appellate Body, which stopped functioning on December 10 due to the American veto on new appointments of judges. The proposal aims at amending the existing Regulation (EU) 654/2014 on the enforcement of international trade rules, most commonly referred as the Enforcement Regulation ('Regulation'). The Regulation currently serves as a legal basis for the EU to (1) adopt trade countermeasures when its trading partners do not fulfill their obligations under WTO treaties and (2) set the condition that a trade dispute proceed all the way through the WTO dispute resolution system before the EU can act in retaliation.Given the current paralysis of the WTO Appellate Body, the Commission's proposal, if adopted, will allow the EU to act even if a dispute has not gone through the entire dispute resolution procedure and even though the WTO has not delivered a final ruling on a dispute. This change will prevent trading partners from blocking European countermeasures by simply filing an appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. This does not mean that the EU is turning its back on the multilateral trading system, as the proposal still requires the EU to wait for the dispute to go through a first-instance panel, which means the EU will still be bound by first-instance WTO rulings.The Commission has specified that the change would also apply to dispute settlement provisions in bilateral or regional trade agreements to ensure that the block is not toothless when a trading partner hinders the effective settlement of a dispute. In line with this reform, the new Commission has created the position of 'Chief Trade Enforcement Officer' within its Directorate-General for Trade. The new trade enforcement boss will be dedicated to the monitoring and effective enforcement of the numerous trade agreements the EU has concluded in recent years. The position is expected to be filled early this year.Copyright 2020 K ...Gates [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/philip-torb-l\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/philip-torb-l</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/m-lanie-bruneau\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/m-lanie-bruneau</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/giovanni-campi\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/giovanni-campi</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/francesco-carloni\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/francesco-carloni</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/miguel-caramello-alvarez\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/miguel-caramello-alvarez</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/alessandro-di-mario\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/alessandro-di-mario</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/kl-gates\">https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/kl-gates</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.klgateshub.com\">http://www.klgateshub.com</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NTLR120709158135253682925876100222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTLR-120709</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5W-FBS1-F03R-N1FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2763\"/><timeReceived>4:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>National Law Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Corporate Business Organizations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Communications, Media Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer Protection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Global</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities SEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Union</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

In addition, she has been given the role of Executive Vice-President of the Commission, responsible for coordinating the overall digital agenda for the EU.Vestager's additional role clearly indicates that the Commission's enforcement will increasingly focus on digital markets. This is in line with the approach taken so far by Vestager, whose previous mandate has been marked by a number of high-profile investigations against big tech companies. Over the past five years, a major search engine company has been fined three times by the Commission, most recently in March 2019, for alleged abusive practices in online advertising. </p><p>In December 2019, the Commission opened a preliminary investigation into the way two major tech companies are gathering, processing, using, and monetizing users' data, including for advertising purposes. The Commission also is investigating whether a major online platform has misused sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace in breach of EU competition rules.Vestager will also have a broader set of tools allowing her to tackle issues in the digital sector on different fronts. Notably, she will be in charge of coordinating Europe's position on digital taxation.The choice to entrust Vestager with the responsibility for coordinating the EU digital agenda indicates that there will be a closer relationship between competition enforcement and regulatory policy in the digital sector, notably with respect to platforms. Regarding platforms activities, Vestager recently indicated 'how we will handle that, we have not started formulating yet. But that is on our working schedule.'Whilst large tech companies' behavior will remain under close scrutiny, the current EU competition rules are likely to be refined and adapted to the challenges of the digital era. Indeed, the Commission's Mission Letter to Vestager states that she 'will evaluate and review Europe's competition rules' as well as 'consider using the tool of sector inquiries into new and emerging markets that are shaping our economy and society.' Digitalization is likely to be a focus, as Vestager indicated last December the need to keep 'the rulebook up to date' with respect to digital markets.United Kingdom's Competition Authority Publishes Interim Digital Report On December 18, 2019, the UK Competition and Markets Authority ('CMA') published an update ('Interim Report') of its examination of online platforms and digital advertising.Building up on the findings of the so-called Furman's report, the CMA especially expressed a concern that certain digital platforms have grown so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms. Based on its findings, the CMA concluded in the Interim Report that there is a strong argument for the development of a new regulatory regime. Such regime could focus on changing the behavior of online platforms via an enforceable code of conduct for platforms with strategic market status. Platforms with such strategic market status should thus be subject to three overarching principles: fair trading, open choices, and trust and transparency.The fair trading principle would require the platform to trade on fair and reasonable terms for services where they are an unavoidable trading partner because of their market position.The open choices principle would require the platform to allow users to choose freely between elements of the platform's services and those offered by competitors, thus introducing interoperability.Finally, the trust and transparency principle would aim to ensure that platforms provide sufficient information to users, including both consumers and businesses that transact with the platform.Moreover, the Interim Report also envisages specific interventions aimed to address the sources of market power as well as barriers to entry and expansion. These interventions include data access and interoperability remedies, measures to give consumers greater control over their data, enabling switching and multi-homing, and separation remedies.The CMA is currently consulting on the Interim Report ahead of publishing its final version by July 2, 2020. The CMA welcomes stakeholders' input by February 12, 2020.At this stage, the CMA is expecting that the most likely outcome of the process will be recommendations to the UK government on how to regulate the digital sector. In the meantime, the CMA expressed its continued readiness to intervene directly with its own powers if potentially problematic issues are not addressed, whether domestically or internationally.Economic and Financial Affairs IOSCO Launches Framework for Monitoring Leverage in Funds On December 13, 201, the International Organization of Securities Commissions ('IOSCO') issued a report outlining recommendations on a two-step framework assessing leverage in investment funds. The initiative is a follow up to a Financial Stability Board Recommendation requesting from IOSCO to develop consistent measures of leverage in funds to facilitate more meaningful monitoring of leverage for financial stability purposes.The framework proposed by IOSCO aims at achieving a balance between precise leverage measures and simple robust metrics that can be applied to the wide range of funds offered in different jurisdictions. The framework enhances proportionality taking into account that not all funds threaten financial stability due to their regulatory and legal characteristics.In the first step, the framework addresses how regulators identify the funds that could pose financial stability risks through using Gross Notional Exposure or adjusted Gross Notional Exposure. In this context, IOSCO characterizes these metrics as baseline analytical tools, underlying their susceptibility to overstate a fund's exposure and not excluding funds that are unlikely to yield financial stability risks. In the second step, a risk-based analysis of the funds identified in the first step will be performed, giving regulators the leeway to determine their approach towards conducting the funds' risk assessment.To this respect, IOSCO puts forward a set of risk factors\u2014counterparty, market, liquidity\u2014to be considered by regulators in their risk analysis.In this context, IOSCO, based on the data available by regulators pursuant to its recommendations, will publish an annual report reflecting leverage trends within the asset management industry at a global level. The first report is scheduled for release in 2021.Consumer Protection Booking.com Commits to Align Practices Presenting Offers and Prices With EU Law Following a dialogue with the European Commission and national consumer protection authorities, Booking.com has made a number of commitments to change the way they present offers, discounts and prices to consumers, in order to align with the requirements of EU consumer law.By June 16, 2020, Booking.com will make several changes in their practices designed to increase the platform's transparency towards consumers. The changes mainly concern the way that information will be displayed on the platform. The objectives are to clarify the expiry of available offers, the ranking of results and the criteria for price comparison. The changes shall also involve displaying the total price that the consumer will have to pay, including all fees and taxes that can be reasonably calculated in advance, as well as whether an accommodation is offered by a private or a professional host.In terms of next steps, the competent national authorities will review the implementation of these commitments, independently of any other assessment of compliance with consumer law principles that could be raised in the context of national proceedings. Under the supervision of the European Commission, the national authorities will continue to assess other major online travel services platforms practices.This procedure results from the collaboration between enforcement authorities under the current Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation ('CPC Regulation'). Importantly, a new CPC Regulation will be applicable as of January 17, 2020, under which national authorities of the European Economic Area countries (EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) are expected to further extend their cooperation to jointly address consumer law infringements in the internal market. The new CPC Regulation will allow national authorities to tackle new areas such as short duration infringements or misleading advertising campaigns. Its purpose is also to strengthen competences of national authorities in order to ease cross-border cooperation and deal with bad online practices more efficiently.Institutional Affairs The Croatian Presidency of the EU Outlines Its Priorities From January 1 to June 30, 2020, Croatia will preside over the Council of the EU for the first time since it joined the EU in 2013. During this six-month period, Croatia will set the agenda of the Council and lead the work of the institution that, together with the European Parliament, adopts EU law. The challenges the new Presidency is called to face include in particular Brexit and the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021 - 2027, which Croatia intends to advance. Croatia, taking over from the Finnish Presidency, will work around four main sets of priorities, which it has defined as 'a Europe that develops, a Europe that connects, a Europe that protects and an influential Europe'.A Europe that develops Under this broad goal, the Croatian Presidency aims to boost a balanced regional development by reducing economic disparities among Member States, reinforcing the Economic and Monetary Union and ensuring a uniform quality of products throughout the single market. To achieve these objectives, a number of legislative proposals may feature in the coming months, in particular: the Directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral; the Regulation on the EU Sovereign Bond-backed Securities and the Regulation to establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme.In line with the European Commission's priorities, the Croatian Presidency intends to improve environmental protection and fight climate change by advancing discussions on a green Europe and, through the implementation of the Paris Agreement, help transition to a low carbon and circular economy. To do so, the proposals on a Regulation on the framework to facilitate sustainable investment, a Regulation establishing a programme for the environment and climate action and a Regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse are the prominent pieces of legislation that the Presidency plans to push through the legislative machinery.Furthermore, the Croatian Presidency plans to strengthen the competitiveness of European industry, including small and medium enterprises, deepen the single market and promote the digitalization of business. To this end, the following pending proposals could be negotiated: the Regulation to establish a Programme for single market competitiveness of enterprises, including SMEs and European statistics 2021-2027; the Regulation establishing Horizon Europe - the Framework programme for research and innovation 2021-2027; and the Regulation establishing the Digital Europe Programme 2021-2027.A Europe that connects With the aim of further developing a networked economy and exploiting its full potential, Croatia proposes to boost a Single European Transport Area through dedicated funds for the construction of infrastructure networks and the innovation and digitalization of all branches of the transport sector. The following proposals fall under this remit: the Directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures; the Directive on the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road; and the Directive on the establishment of common rules for certain types of combined transport of goods between Member States.Moreover, Croatia announced it will focus on the improvement of the quality and security of data infrastructure by creating the conditions for the full deployment of 5G networks, and expressed its intention to deepen the integration of the energy market by fostering the Energy Union.A Europe that protects To ensure the security of EU citizens, Croatia plans to improve the effectiveness of controls over external borders, enhance the interoperability of IT systems in the area of justice and home affairs, and strengthen resilience against malicious cyber activities. Some of the proposals relevant to achieve these objectives are the Regulation on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online; the Regulation concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications; and the Regulation on establishing the Internal Security Fund.An influential Europe Finally, to face global challenges, the new Presidency promotes the vision of a 'leading role for the EU on a global scale'. However, it does not specify which measures it intends to adopt to achieve such an objective, besides strengthening multilateralism, cooperation with third countries and promoting enlargement as well as neighbourhood policy, especially with the Western Balkans.International Trade, Customs, and External Relations Europe Proposes Aggressive Action Amid WTO Tensions Against a backdrop of heightened global tensions over international trade, the European Commission unveiled a proposal for a regulation that would allow the EU to protect its trade interests despite the paralysis of the WTO's Appellate Body, which stopped functioning on December 10 due to the American veto on new appointments of judges. The proposal aims at amending the existing Regulation (EU) 654/2014 on the enforcement of international trade rules, most commonly referred as the Enforcement Regulation ('Regulation'). The Regulation currently serves as a legal basis for the EU to (1) adopt trade countermeasures when its trading partners do not fulfill their obligations under WTO treaties and (2) set the condition that a trade dispute proceed all the way through the WTO dispute resolution system before the EU can act in retaliation.Given the current paralysis of the WTO Appellate Body, the Commission's proposal, if adopted, will allow the EU to act even if a dispute has not gone through the entire dispute resolution procedure and even though the WTO has not delivered a final ruling on a dispute. This change will prevent trading partners from blocking European countermeasures by simply filing an appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. This does not mean that the EU is turning its back on the multilateral trading system, as the proposal still requires the EU to wait for the dispute to go through a first-instance panel, which means the EU will still be bound by first-instance WTO rulings.The Commission has specified that the change would also apply to dispute settlement provisions in bilateral or regional trade agreements to ensure that the block is not toothless when a trading partner hinders the effective settlement of a dispute. In line with this reform, the new Commission has created the position of 'Chief Trade Enforcement Officer' within its Directorate-General for Trade. The new trade enforcement boss will be dedicated to the monitoring and effective enforcement of the numerous trade agreements the EU has concluded in recent years. The position is expected to be filled early this year. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411157963415567975776100034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1R-JV51-F03R-N03S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2639\"/><timeReceived>7:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

Increased fragmentation and the absence of the traditional center right (EPP) - center left (S...majority will likely complicate political decision-making.The highest voter turnout in 20 years showed the EU citizens' interest to tame the expected anti-EU protest wave, but also their willingness to be heard on issues such as climate change, immigration, and Brexit. While the feared radical anti-establishment revolution was warded off, strengthened populist forces can be expected to further complicate long-term integration ambitions.Increasing its representation by almost forty seats, the new group Renew Europe (former centrist/liberal ALDE group) secured a key role for itself in forging future pro-European alliances in the EP. </p><p>Despite the clear concentration in Germany and northern European member states, with almost 20 seats gained, the Greens also raised their stakes in the upcoming majority-making exercise. Previously considered as a marginal group, it now appears that Greens will be the ally that every large group needs, and their strong election result will translate into a push for increased environmental considerations across politics and policies. Their support will therefore come with a price tag. Concessions from the two main political families - European Socialists and Democrats ('S... and the center right People's party ('EPP'), both losing almost 40 seats, are certain.Moreover, in the aftermath of Brexit, the number of Members of the EP ('MEPs') will decrease from 751 to 705, with 27 of the 73 British seats being allocated to candidates from 14 Member States, who are currently on the waiting lists. Without considering the Euroskeptic Brexit Party, the groups affected the most by UK's departure will be Renew Europe (losing 16 seats), Greens (11 seats) and S...10 seats).The new EP composition also shifts the internal balance of power within political groups. The largest S...elegation comes from the leftist Spanish socialist party, while the backbone of the last legislative term, the Italian center-left Democratic Party, has been considerably weakened. As a result, the S...s likely to reshuffle its priorities further to the left and put climate change/sustainability, fair taxation and social policies at center stage. The strong Renew Europe representation is primarily driven by the alliance with French President Macron's party. The French delegation includes many green-minded MEPs, which could give particular importance to environmental issues. Interestingly, the Green group also includes heterogeneous movements such as pro-independence regionalist parties from Spain and 'pirate parties' calling for citizens' digital rights.The first task of the newly elected representatives will be to elect the new President of the European Commission. Under the informal 'Spitzenkandidat' process[1], firmly supported[2] by a majority within the EP, the top EU role should be given to a candidate of the leading EU political party. However, with some critical voices like France's President Macron, its nomination by the European Council might prove to be more complicated than five years ago. To be elected, the Commission President will need the backing of a majority of the Member States, as well as the absolute majority in the EP. Among the various options, a 433 seat-strong pro-EU coalition, comprising EPP, S...nd Renew Europe, would be sufficient to elect the new Commission President, but appears potentially shaky as regards alignment on programs and policies.The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has already signaled[3] that there will be no automaticity in the process of selecting the new Commission President. Political dynamics related to the Commission President also will be influenced by other high-level appointments, i.e. the European Council President, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the President of the European Central Bank. Party affiliations, but also geographical and gender balance will be decisive elements.As regards policies, it is difficult to imagine that the new political cycle will produce leaps forward for integrationists, such as, for example, the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union ('EMU') and in particular risk mutualization, or the removal of the unanimity requirement in tax policy matters.It appears that trade policy might prove to be one of the policy areas most affected by the election results. A more reluctant approach to trade liberalization can be expected along with deeper scrutiny of labor conditions, sustainability and climate change considerations in international agreements. Similarly, it is fair to expect that the EU agendas around climate strategy, circular economy, sustainable development, sustainable finance and other areas will enjoy stronger political support in the years to come. As regards tech policy, a large number of MEPs involved in the discussion of digital files have been re-elected to the EP. Over the next five years, they are likely to require the adoption of more stringent rules on electronic privacy and platforms' liability towards consumers and SMEs, as well as on taxation of big tech firms and the intersection between digital and competition policy.ulting from the EU inter-institutional negotiations, is now subject to formal approval by the Parliament and Council.Antitrust and Competition European Commission fines five banks for taking part in two cartels in the Spot Foreign Exchange marketOn 16 May 2019, the European Commission adopted two separate settlement decisions related to two cartels in the Spot Foreign Exchange (Forex) market for eleven currencies and involving five major banks. Spot Forex transactions refer to the trading of currencies done by major companies via traders on the same day at a prevailing exchange rate.The Commission opened an investigation in September 2013 following an immunity application from one of the banks involved. The leniency procedure allows the first company that reveals the existence of a cartel to the Commission to avoid fines. The following companies that provide relevant information to the Commission may benefit from reductions of their fines. The percentage of reduction depends on the extent and relevance of the information provided and on the order in which applicants provide information.Following its investigation, the Commission found that the banks' traders in charge of Forex spot trading participated in two cartels in the form of chatrooms. In these chatrooms, traders exchanged sensitive information relating to details on customers' orders (the name of the client, the amount to be exchanged and the currencies concerned), prices applicable to specific transactions, their open risk positions and other details of current or planned trading activities. Such information exchanges allowed the traders to coordinate certain trading practices, notably standing down, i.e. refraining from trading activity to avoid interfering with other participants' trading activities.The aggregated amount of the fines imposed on the five banks is approximately EUR 1.07 billion. This also includes the Commission's reduction of 10% of the fines imposed on each bank involved in the settlement procedure. Such procedure allows participants to a cartel to acknowledge their participation and their liability in exchange of a 10% reduction of fines. This also allows the Commission to avoid long and complicated procedures.The Commission indicated that, although it closed the procedure for these two cartels, it will continue pursuing other ongoing matters concerning conducts in the Forex spot trading market.Although in 2018 the Commission adopted only four decisions, these two decisions show that the Commission will continue to prioritize cartel enforcement. The low number of decisions in 2018 is mostly due to the fact that cartel cases remain a long and complicated process. For instance, in the Forex investigation, the procedure lasted almost 6 years from the immunity application to the adoption of the final decisions. As EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager notably stated, 'these cartel decisions send a clear message that the Commission will not tolerate collusive behaviour in any sector of the financial markets.'European Commission fines the world's biggest beer brewer for restricting cross-border salesOn 13 May 2019, the European Commission issued a decision imposing on the world's largest beer brewer a fine in an amount of 200 million euros for abusing its dominant position in the Belgian beer market.On 30 June 2016 the Commission opened an investigation into potentially anti-competitive practices led by Anheuser-Busch InBev ('Company') under EU Competition law for abuse of dominant position. From the investigation the Commission determined that the Company held a dominant position in the Belgian beer market based on indicators of constantly high market shares, ability to independently increase prices, the existence of significant barriers to entry, and limited countervailing buyer power of retailers.In this case, the Commission found that the Company infringed Article 102 TFEU notably by preventing cross-border sales of beer within the EU and notably by hindering supermarkets and wholesalers to buy and to import beer in Belgium from the Netherlands at a lower price thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage.In its investigation, the Commission highlighted that the Company' strategy was achieved through a number of restrictive practices such as altering the beer packaging and removing mandatory information for consumers, restricting supplies of beer to the Netherlands so to limit imports to Belgium, limiting the sale of product to Belgian retailers subject to their agreement to limit imports from the Netherlands and making customer promotions in the Netherlands conditional upon not offering the same promotions to customers in Belgium.Given the cooperation shown by the Company throughout the investigation, notably by acknowledging the facts and by agreeing to legally binding remedies to provide mandatory food information on the beer packaging both in French and Dutch, the Commission agreed to a 15% reduction of the fine. For these reasons, and taking into account the duration of the infringement, which lasted from 9 February 2009 to 31 October 2016, the Commission imposed a fine of \u20ac200 Million.Telecommunications, Media and Technology New obligations for online platforms are on the horizonOn 14 June 2019, the Council of the European Union formally adopted the Regulation[4] on fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services. The Regulation sets out platform-to-business rules based on transparency and dispute resolution in order to ensure greater predictability and fairness for those businesses.As of 2020, a large number of online platforms that allow EU businesses to sell goods or provide services to customers located in the EU will be subject to new requirements. The Regulation will apply to e-commerce marketplaces (including collaborative ones, in which business users are active), price comparison websites, social media, app stores and, to a limited extent, search engines. Pure business-to-business platforms, online payment services and online advertising tools are excluded from the scope of the new rules.According to the European Commission, more than one million businesses, especially SMEs, already sell goods and services via online platforms.Under the new rules, platforms will be required to ensure that their contractual terms and conditions are clear, easily available and that any changes to them are promptly notified. Moreover, platforms will be able to suspend or terminate their contractual relationship with business users only based on objective grounds and by providing a statement of reasons that led to these measures. Ranking has a huge impact on online sales. For this reason, the Regulation will require platforms to indicate in their terms and conditions the main parameters determining the position of goods and services. This is the only requirement applicable to search engines.Similar transparency obligations concern the description of differentiated treatments given to goods and services offered by the platforms (or by business users they control) and access of business users to data generated by the provision of their services. Finally, platforms employing more than 50 persons will need to set up an internal system for handling complaints from business users.As regards business-to-consumers relations, on 17 April 2019 the European Parliament confirmed the political agreement[5] reached with the Council on the proposed Directive on better enforcement and modernization of EU consumer protection rules.One of the main objectives of the Directive is to adapt the EU consumer protection framework to digital transformation. To this end, the Directive will oblige platforms such as online market places, search engines and comparison websites to make it clear when third parties pay to be placed in a list of search results ('paid inclusion') or for receiving higher ranking. Platforms will also be required to inform consumers whether they are concluding a contact with a professional seller or not and whether the transaction is protected by consumer legislation.This is the first time that the EU establishes cross-sectorial rules applicable to online platforms. We are only at the beginning of this process, but it seems likely that the next targets of the Commission may be algorithms and the advertising ecosystem.Trade International agreement reached to tighten rules on plastic waste exportsIn an effort to clamp down on plastic garbage exports, on 10 May 2019, the final day of a summit in Geneva on the Basel Convention, 186 countries (not including the United States) plus the EU backed a Norwegian proposal to submit most plastic waste exports to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes[6]. From now on, only plastic waste which is clean, not mixed or contaminated and ready for recycling will be able to be shipped without prior and informed consent.This new measure means that exporting countries would now need to reinforce their recycling businesses, a development that might result in new business opportunities for the global recycling industry of more than $200 billion. On the other hand, the work of the private entities that until now received plastic scrap in developing countries with existing recycling infrastructure in place will depend on governmental approval.Plastic waste is often dirty and poorly sorted, making it hard to recycle. Until May 10, there were no international restrictions on plastic waste shipments, which means the garbage flooded into poor countries that lack the capacity to manage it properly. The discussions about finding solutions on how to deal with excessive amounts of plastic garbage tuned to a heated debate after China's January 2018 ban on waste imports, followed by India's ban in March 2019. Because plastic waste flows quickly diverted to other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand also began to restrict imports the past months. There was a growing push to act and eventually, at a U.N. Environment Assembly in March 2019, countries called for changing the rules on plastic waste shipments.In the EU's position on the Norwegian proposal, the bloc clarified certain terms and asked for six more months \u2014 until July 2020 \u2014 to allow countries to properly implement it, but otherwise its position mirrors that of Norway. The EU is on board because it has been trying to increase recycling at home in an effort to reduce waste and its environmental impact, as well as cutting reliance on imports of fossil fuels. Because the EU Member States are represented by the international organization of the EU as party in the Basel Convention, the decision reached on 10 May is directly binding on EU countries, hence the EU institutions do not have go through the procedure of adopting new legislation of the respective rules.The U.S., the second largest waste exporter after the EU, is not party to the convention and opposed changing the rules, arguing it would undermine global recycling of plastic material without addressing the unsound disposal practices that cause marine plastic litter and microplastics. The U.S. could still strike bilateral or regional deals with importing countries that are parties to the Basel Convention, but these would still have to apply Basel environmental standards.The new rules would apply from January 2021, according to the draft decision.Economic and Financial Affairs EU financial supervisors advise the Commission on sustainability considerations in investment and insurance legislationOn 3 May 2019, the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') published a set of proposals introducing environmental, social and governance ('ESG') considerations in delegated acts covering investment services[7] (under MiFID II [1]) and investments funds[8] (under AIFM and UCITS Directives [2]). On the same day, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ('EIOPA') issued similar proposals[9] covering (re-)insurance (under Solvency II [3]) and insurance distribution (under IDD [4]). These proposals follow a request by the European Commission to explore possible avenues to incorporate ESG risks in the decisions taken and processes applied by financial market participants subject to the abovementioned legislation.In its advice, ESMA referred to the industry feedback received in the preceding consultation. Among the key issues highlighted by stakeholders were the lack of common terminology and definitions as to what constitutes sustainability risks and factors, and the absence of a common taxonomy of sustainable business activities. The industry further demanded explicit references to materiality in the definitions used. Acknowledging the problem, ESMA invited the Commission to ensure consistency and apply definitions agreed under the adopted Disclosures Regulation[10] [5], which already includes references to materiality in the definition of sustainability risk.With respect to funds' operating conditions, stakeholders sought clarity on whether the integration of ESG risks in investment processes concerns only the possible negative financial impact on portfolios or the actual impact of investee companies on the environment and society. According to ESMA, the most effective due diligence process includes both of these considerations. ESMA further underlined that the transition towards a more sustainable economy relies on stewardship, which is already enshrined under the Shareholders Rights Directive [6]. ESMA however clarified, that under the Disclosures Regulation, the considerations of the actual broader impact on due diligence will be mandatory only for some firms. ESMA acknowledged the industry recommendation to reflect the type of investment strategy (e.g. as index-based strategies) in the due diligence requirements. According to ESMA, such proportionality is already incorporated in the existing UCITS and AIFMD rules and therefore does not warrant specific clarification.Similarly in the insurance sector, EIOPA encouraged the application of the stewardship approach by insurers and reinsurers and incorporated sustainability considerations in the prudent person principle [7]. EIOPA advised the Commission to require that insurance undertakings reflect the ESG preferences of policyholders and beneficiaries in their investment portfolio, where these preferences are relevant for the target market.The European Commission will work with ESMA and EIOPA to translate their advice into delegated acts, which will consequently be subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.Notes[1] Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (2014/65/EU) [2] The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (2011/61/EU) and the Undertakings in Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (2009/65/EC) [3] Directive on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (2009/138/EC) [4] Insurance Distribution Directive (2016/97) [5] Proposal for a regulation on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks (2018/0179(COD) [6] Directive on the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement (2017/828) [7] The prudent person principle stipulates that insurers may only invest in assets and instruments whose risks the undertaking concerned can properly identify, measure, monitor, manage, control and report and take into account in the assessment of its overall solvency needs.

The Commission considered that the 10.25bn takeover would have eliminated competition between two important entities in the UK mobile telephony market. It added that the reduction from four to three competitors would have likely had a negative impact on the ability of the other operators to compete on prices as well as other key areas, such as innovation, network and quality of services, to the detriment of consumers. In order to address the Commission's competition concerns, the notifying party offered a range of remedies, including divestitures and behavioural commitments, to strengthen network capacity and encourage entry by new operators. However, the Commission found the remedy proposals to be insufficient and prohibited the transaction.In a judgment of 28 May 2020 and following an appeal from the MNO, the General Court of the EU (GCEU), the lower court of the EU, upheld the appeal and annulled the Commission's decision. </p><p>The GCEU found that the Commission wrongly applied the legal standard to demonstrate the adverse effects of the transaction on prices, quality and consumers choice. The court ruled that the Commission committed 'several errors of law' when determining the potentially harmful effects stemming from the transaction and that it had failed to prove that price would rise or that competition would be impeded as a result of the transaction.The GCEU's judgment is one of the only two successful appeals against EU merger prohibitions in the last 18 years. With respect to merger decisions, there is generally a strong deference of the EU courts towards the Commission's assessment of the merits of a case. This is because the EU courts grant the Commission a wider margin of appreciation in relation to complex economic matters and limit their judicial review to manifest errors of assessment.In the present case, the GCEU sends a clear message regarding the boundary of the Commission's margin of appreciation of complex mergers. This judgment will have significant implications and could trigger further telecoms consolidations in several European markets. It is also a welcome step as it suggests that the EU courts are likely to scrutinize more closely the Commission's assessment of mergers.The GCEU's judgment can be appealed to the Court of justice of the EU (CJEU), the European highest court. The Commission shall decide whether to appeal to the CJEU on a point of law. In that regard, the EU Competition Commissioner Vestager recently stated that 'there are a lot of new legal issues being raised in the judgment, and on the basis of that, of course, we will decide whether to appeal or not.'The French Competition Authority Publishes a Study on Competition and E-CommerceOn 5 June 2020, the French Competition Authority (FCA) published a study providing an overview of issues affecting distribution business and companies' online practices. The study is part of a broader discussion within the FCA on the digital market specificities and on the FCA's tools and powers to address the challenges relating to technological innovation.In the context of growing e-commerce and continued development of digital technologies profoundly affecting the distribution landscape, the traditional 'brick and mortar' distribution model faces strong competition challenges.According to the FCA's study, the entrance of new operators into the market makes Internet to contribute to the increase of competition. To this extent, the existence and development of online commerce has a pro-competitive effect and mitigates the competitive risks that could otherwise arise from mergers and acquisitions, vertical agreements or abuse of dominant position.However, the competitive pressure from online sales may differ depending on the sector concerned. Each sector shall therefore be analysed on a case-by-case basis in order to determine whether the characteristics of products and customers are likely to mitigate or to reinforce this competitive pressure. Furthermore, taking into account the competitive pressure has also lead the FCA to adapt its grid of analysis, in particular the evaluation of market shares, or to consider new factors and competitive risks related to network effects or big data.The study also shows that national competition authorities across EU countries assess online commerce, not only with regard to the behaviour of manufacturers or distributors, but also considering intermediaries or online platforms, the role of which is increasingly important. Indeed, in the past years, numerous cases initiated by the competition authorities have shown that competition law is capable of detecting, analysing and punishing the behaviour of these intermediaries when they restrict competition on the digital market.Digital Economy The Commission Launched Consultation on Digital Services Act PackageThe Commission launched a public consultation [1]on the Digital Services Act package (DSA) in June which covers both e-commerce rules and a new ex ante regulatory instrument. This initiative was envisaged in Commission President von der Leyen's political guidelines [2]and further clarified in the Commission's Communication on 'Shaping Europe's Digital Future[3]' (Communication) published in February 2020.The envisaged measures can be summarized as follows: E-commerce rules are expected to cover rules to harmonise responsibilities of online platforms and information service providers. While the Commission's Inception impact assessment [4]lists several options on how to tackle these issues, the Commission generally aims to further clarify the role and obligations of online intermediaries, notably with respect to harmonised obligations to maintain 'notice-and-action' systems, more effective redress and protection against unjustified removal for legitimate content and goods online. The Commission also envisages a more effective governance system to ensure a certain level of enforcement harmonization across the EU Single Market, while guaranteeing the respect of fundamental rights. The new rules could be covering also non-European platforms active in the EU. The ex ante regulatory instrument would address the issue of large platforms with significant network effects acting as gatekeepers. In this case, the Commission's Inception impact assessment [5]provides an overview of possible policy options, including general rules for all platforms of a certain scale (such as 'blacklisted' practices) and tailored regulatory obligations for specific gatekeepers (such as data access obligations, data portability or interoperability requirements).According to the Adjusted Commission Work Programme[6], the DSA is now expected at the end of 2020. The DSA consultation is open until 8 September 2020.New Transparency Bill Approved by Japanese ParliamentOn 27 May 2020, the upper house of the Japanese Parliament approved a bill requiring big tech companies to improve transparency and fairness when dealing with Japanese business users offering goods and services on digital platforms. The bill, modelled on the EU's 'P2B Regulation,' is aimed at regulating large platforms and preventing their unfair treatment of business users.As opposed to the EU's P2B Regulation, the Japanese equivalent will not apply to all online intermediary, but will limit its scope of application to large distribution platforms. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has tasked a new specialized unit, the Digital Business Environment Enhancement Office, with the definition of the exact scope of the regulation and with its enforcement. For that purpose, the unit is set to issue a draft ordinance and explain its rationale.In addition to the scope of application, the Japanese rules contain other differences from the EU's P2B Regulation. While the latter gives freedom to digital platform providers to choose mediators, the Japanese bill imposes a mediator which will be the METI. Until now, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) was the main regulator for big technology companies, but the METI (with JFTC support) will now take on the role. The transparency and predictability obligations of the regulation, as well as the requirement to disclose ranking parameters, are similar to the EU's P2B Regulation.Concerns have been raised on whether the METI is the right body to regulate platforms, and whether the joint effort with the JFTC could lead to overlaps between the new rules and competition rules and their respective enforcement.Companies subject to the new rules will be required to submit every year a self-evaluation report to the METI, which will be published. It is worth mentioning, that the new bill does not impose any fines or penalties. However, if a company is considered to have an insufficient level of transparency, the ministry can issue an 'improvement order.' It is expected that the new regulation and the unit created to enforce it will produce important changes in the digital platforms' market, and that big tech companies can brace themselves for an increased level of scrutiny in the following months.Economic and Financial Affairs Capital Markets Union High Level Forum Issues Final ReportOn 10 June 2020, the Capital Markets Union High Level Forum (CMU HLF), a Commission expert group, published its final report[7].The capital markets union (CMU) is an EU initiative which aims to enhance the integration of capital markets of EU Member States, to promote a more stable financial system, to strengthen the international role of the euro and to diversify funding sources for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The CMU HLF, established in November 2019, consists of 28 experts who cooperated to propose policy recommendations.The final report contains recommendations addressed to European institutions and to EU Member States covering 17 areas of capital market policy which aims to develop a new capital market ecosystem to boost growth and employment. In early autumn, the Commission will present its next CMU Action Plan, with Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, pledging that it would 'carefully consider' the CMU HLF's recommendations. Some of the CMU HLF's key recommendations include: Establishing an EU Single Access Point for company data. This recommendation addresses the lack of comparable and easily accessible public information about companies, which hinders access to diverse sources of funding. The EU Single Access Point will be a digital access platform to companies' public financial and non-financial information, which shall be freely accessible to the public and free of fees or license use. The report also notes that the EU Single Access Point could be used as a repository for all sustainability-related public information by listed companies. Facilitating cross-border issuance. The CMU HLF recommends a targeted review of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation. Proposing a common definition of 'shareholder' along with the harmonization of standards concerning shareholders exercise of voting rights and corporate action processing. Changes to the pensions system (pension tracking, auto-enrolment in occupational pension schemes and EU Member States pension dashboards) to ensure pension sustainability. Introducing a standardised system for withholding tax relief. Existing withholding tax procedures are complex and burdensome for cross-border investors. In this regard, the report suggests harmonized tax definitions and forms, along with a common pan-European process for relief at source. Converging insolvency frameworks to increase confidence in cross-border financing. To this end, the report proposes the development of a new directive on insolvency.International Trade, Customs, and External Relations The Commission Issues its White Paper on Foreign Subsidies in the EU MarketOn 17 June 2020, the Commission presented the long-awaited White Paper [8]on foreign subsidies in the EU Single Market, which proposes options to tackle the distortive effects that foreign subsidies create in the EU Market and aims to ensure that companies compete on a level playing field within the EU.In particular, the White Paper intends to address the regulatory gap existing when foreign subsidies taking the form of financial flows facilitate acquisitions of EU companies or where they directly support the operation of a company in the EU, or help bidding in public tenders. Against this background, the White Paper proposes several approaches and puts forward three 'modules': Module 1 sets out the establishment of a general market scrutiny tool able to address all potential market distortions caused in the EU Market by foreign subsidies. The investigative powers of the supervisory authority (national authority or the Commission) would be triggered by any suspicion or evidence that a company in the EU benefits from a foreign subsidy. In case a foreign subsidy is identified, the supervisory authority could impose remedies to address the distortive effects, such as redress payments and structural or behavioural remedies. The authority should also assess the positive impact of the subsidised activity or investment and may decide to close the investigation on the basis that intervention would be against European interests (EU Interest Test). Module 2 would build upon Module 1 by addressing specifically foreign subsidies that facilitate the acquisition of European companies. Companies receiving foreign subsidies would be required to notify the European Commission of their acquisitions of EU companies. Should the Commission determine that the acquisition is supported by the foreign subsidy and distorts the EU Market, it could accept commitments by the acquirer that effectively remedy the distortion or, as a last resort, it could prohibit the acquisition. The Commission could also apply the EU Interest Test and decide to not pursue the investigation further. Module 3 targets distortions created by foreign subsidies in the context of public procurement procedures, which may provide bidders with the unfair advantage of obtaining public contracts thanks to bids below market price or even below cost. Under this module, bidders would have an obligation to notify the contracting authority of financial contributions granted by non-EU countries. To prevent economic operators from failing to comply with the notification obligation and avoid the submission of incorrect information, the White Paper suggests the adoption of deterrent tools, such as significant fines and, as a last resort, the exclusion from the procurement procedure or the termination of an ongoing contract. If the contracting and supervisory authorities establish that the bidder benefitted from a foreign subsidy, which made the procurement procedure unfair, they would exclude the bidder from the procurement procedure.To ensure that economic operators compete on an equal footing when applying for EU financial support, the White Paper proposes options to prevent unfair advantages stemming from foreign subsidies in such context as well.Finally, the document stresses that international financial institutions implementing projects supported by the EU budget, such as the European Investment Bank, should reflect the Commission approach to foreign subsidies in their processes.Stakeholders will be able to submit their input on the options presented in the White Paper via a public consultation[9], which will be open until 23 September 2020. The outcome of the consultation will guide the Commission in setting out legislative proposals to tackle the distortive effects of foreign subsidies on the EU Market.

Caramello Alvarez[5] Alessandro Di Mario[6] K&amp;#38;L Gates[7] Stay Informed[8] Antitrust and CompetitionThe General Court of the EU Overturns a Commission Decision to Prohibit a 10.25bn Telecom Takeover in the UK In 2016, the European Commission (Commission) blocked the proposed acquisition of a UK mobile telecom retailer by a UK Mobile Network Operator (MNO). The Commission considered that the 10.25bn takeover would have eliminated competition between two important entities in the UK mobile telephony market. It added that the reduction from four to three competitors would have likely had a negative impact on the ability of the other operators to compete on prices as well as other key areas, such as innovation, network and quality of services, to the detriment of consumers. In order to address the Commission's competition concerns, the notifying party offered a range of remedies, including divestitures and behavioural commitments, to strengthen network capacity and encourage entry by new operators. However, the Commission found the remedy proposals to be insufficient and prohibited the transaction.In a judgment of 28 May 2020 and following an appeal from the MNO, the General Court of the EU (GCEU), the lower court of the EU, upheld the appeal and annulled the Commission's decision. </p><p>The GCEU found that the Commission wrongly applied the legal standard to demonstrate the adverse effects of the transaction on prices, quality and consumers choice. The court ruled that the Commission committed 'several errors of law' when determining the potentially harmful effects stemming from the transaction and that it had failed to prove that price would rise or that competition would be impeded as a result of the transaction.The GCEU's judgment is one of the only two successful appeals against EU merger prohibitions in the last 18 years. With respect to merger decisions, there is generally a strong deference of the EU courts towards the Commission's assessment of the merits of a case. This is because the EU courts grant the Commission a wider margin of appreciation in relation to complex economic matters and limit their judicial review to manifest errors of assessment.In the present case, the GCEU sends a clear message regarding the boundary of the Commission's margin of appreciation of complex mergers. This judgment will have significant implications and could trigger further telecoms consolidations in several European markets. It is also a welcome step as it suggests that the EU courts are likely to scrutinize more closely the Commission's assessment of mergers.The GCEU's judgment can be appealed to the Court of justice of the EU (CJEU), the European highest court. The Commission shall decide whether to appeal to the CJEU on a point of law. In that regard, the EU Competition Commissioner Vestager recently stated that 'there are a lot of new legal issues being raised in the judgment, and on the basis of that, of course, we will decide whether to appeal or not.' The French Competition Authority Publishes a Study on Competition and E-Commerce On 5 June 2020, the French Competition Authority (FCA) published a study providing an overview of issues affecting distribution business and companies' online practices. The study is part of a broader discussion within the FCA on the digital market specificities and on the FCA's tools and powers to address the challenges relating to technological innovation.In the context of growing e-commerce and continued development of digital technologies profoundly affecting the distribution landscape, the traditional 'brick and mortar' distribution model faces strong competition challenges.According to the FCA's study, the entrance of new operators into the market makes Internet to contribute to the increase of competition. To this extent, the existence and development of online commerce has a pro-competitive effect and mitigates the competitive risks that could otherwise arise from mergers and acquisitions, vertical agreements or abuse of dominant position.However, the competitive pressure from online sales may differ depending on the sector concerned. Each sector shall therefore be analysed on a case-by-case basis in order to determine whether the characteristics of products and customers are likely to mitigate or to reinforce this competitive pressure. Furthermore, taking into account the competitive pressure has also lead the FCA to adapt its grid of analysis, in particular the evaluation of market shares, or to consider new factors and competitive risks related to network effects or big data.The study also shows that national competition authorities across EU countries assess online commerce, not only with regard to the behaviour of manufacturers or distributors, but also considering intermediaries or online platforms, the role of which is increasingly important. Indeed, in the past years, numerous cases initiated by the competition authorities have shown that competition law is capable of detecting, analysing and punishing the behaviour of these intermediaries when they restrict competition on the digital market. Digital EconomyThe Commission Launched Consultation on Digital Services Act Package The Commissionlaunched a public consultation[9]on the Digital Services Act package (DSA) in June which covers both e-commerce rules and a new ex ante regulatory instrument. This initiative was envisaged in Commission President von der Leyen'spolitical guidelines[10]and further clarified in the Commission's Communication on 'Shaping Europe's Digital Future[11]' (Communication) published in February 2020.The envisaged measures can be summarized as follows: E-commerce rules are expected to cover rules to harmonise responsibilities of online platforms and information service providers. While the Commission'sInception impact assessment[12]lists several options on how to tackle these issues, the Commission generally aims to further clarify the role and obligations of online intermediaries, notably with respect to harmonised obligations to maintain 'notice-and-action' systems, more effective redress and protection against unjustified removal for legitimate content and goods online. The Commission also envisages a more effective governance system to ensure a certain level of enforcement harmonization across the EU Single Market, while guaranteeing the respect of fundamental rights. The new rules could be covering also non-European platforms active in the EU. The ex ante regulatory instrument would address the issue of large platforms with significant network effects acting as gatekeepers. In this case, the Commission'sInception impact assessment[13]provides an overview of possible policy options, including general rules for all platforms of a certain scale (such as 'blacklisted' practices) and tailored regulatory obligations for specific gatekeepers (such as data access obligations, data portability or interoperability requirements). According to theAdjusted Commission Work Programme[14], the DSA is now expected at the end of 2020. The DSA consultation is open until 8 September 2020. New Transparency Bill Approved by Japanese Parliament On 27 May 2020, the upper house of the Japanese Parliament approved a bill requiring big tech companies to improve transparency and fairness when dealing with Japanese business users offering goods and services on digital platforms. The bill, modelled on the EU's 'P2B Regulation,' is aimed at regulating large platforms and preventing their unfair treatment of business users.As opposed to the EU's P2B Regulation, the Japanese equivalent will not apply to all online intermediary, but will limit its scope of application to large distribution platforms. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has tasked a new specialized unit, the Digital Business Environment Enhancement Office, with the definition of the exact scope of the regulation and with its enforcement. For that purpose, the unit is set to issue a draft ordinance and explain its rationale.In addition to the scope of application, the Japanese rules contain other differences from the EU's P2B Regulation. While the latter gives freedom to digital platform providers to choose mediators, the Japanese bill imposes a mediator which will be the METI. Until now, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) was the main regulator for big technology companies, but the METI (with JFTC support) will now take on the role. The transparency and predictability obligations of the regulation, as well as the requirement to disclose ranking parameters, are similar to the EU's P2B Regulation.Concerns have been raised on whether the METI is the right body to regulate platforms, and whether the joint effort with the JFTC could lead to overlaps between the new rules and competition rules and their respective enforcement.Companies subject to the new rules will be required to submit every year a self-evaluation report to the METI, which will be published. It is worth mentioning, that the new bill does not impose any fines or penalties. However, if a company is considered to have an insufficient level of transparency, the ministry can issue an 'improvement order.' It is expected that the new regulation and the unit created to enforce it will produce important changes in the digital platforms' market, and that big tech companies can brace themselves for an increased level of scrutiny in the following months. Economic and Financial AffairsCapital Markets Union High Level Forum Issues Final Report On 10 June 2020, the Capital Markets Union High Level Forum (CMU HLF), a Commission expert group, published itsfinal report[15].The capital markets union (CMU) is an EU initiative which aims to enhance the integration of capital markets of EU Member States, to promote a more stable financial system, to strengthen the international role of the euro and to diversify funding sources for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The CMU HLF, established in November 2019, consists of 28 experts who cooperated to propose policy recommendations.The final report contains recommendations addressed to European institutions and to EU Member States covering 17 areas of capital market policy which aims to develop a new capital market ecosystem to boost growth and employment. In early autumn, the Commission will present its next CMU Action Plan, with Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, pledging that it would 'carefully consider' the CMU HLF's recommendations. Some of the CMU HLF's key recommendations include: Establishing an EU Single Access Point for company data. This recommendation addresses the lack of comparable and easily accessible public information about companies, which hinders access to diverse sources of funding. The EU Single Access Point will be a digital access platform to companies' public financial and non-financial information, which shall be freely accessible to the public and free of fees or license use. The report also notes that the EU Single Access Point could be used as a repository for all sustainability-related public information by listed companies. Facilitating cross-border issuance. The CMU HLF recommends a targeted review of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation. Proposing a common definition of 'shareholder' along with the harmonization of standards concerning shareholders exercise of voting rights and corporate action processing. Changes to the pensions system (pension tracking, auto-enrolment in occupational pension schemes and EU Member States pension dashboards) to ensure pension sustainability. Introducing a standardised system for withholding tax relief. Existing withholding tax procedures are complex and burdensome for cross-border investors. In this regard, the report suggests harmonized tax definitions and forms, along with a common pan-European process for relief at source. Converging insolvency frameworks to increase confidence in cross-border financing. To this end, the report proposes the development of a new directive on insolvency.  International Trade, Customs, and External RelationsThe Commission Issues its White Paper on Foreign Subsidies in the EU Market On 17 June 2020, the Commission presented the long-awaitedWhite Paper[16]on foreign subsidies in the EU Single Market, which proposes options to tackle the distortive effects that foreign subsidies create in the EU Market and aims to ensure that companies compete on a level playing field within the EU.In particular, the White Paper intends to address the regulatory gap existing when foreign subsidies taking the form of financial flows facilitate acquisitions of EU companies or where they directly support the operation of a company in the EU, or help bidding in public tenders. Against this background, the White Paper proposes several approaches and puts forward three 'modules': Module 1 sets out the establishment of a general market scrutiny tool able to address all potential market distortions caused in the EU Market by foreign subsidies. The investigative powers of the supervisory authority (national authority or the Commission) would be triggered by any suspicion or evidence that a company in the EU benefits from a foreign subsidy. In case a foreign subsidy is identified, the supervisory authority could impose remedies to address the distortive effects, such as redress payments and structural or behavioural remedies. The authority should also assess the positive impact of the subsidised activity or investment and may decide to close the investigation on the basis that intervention would be against European interests (EU Interest Test). Module 2 would build upon Module 1 by addressing specifically foreign subsidies that facilitate the acquisition of European companies. Companies receiving foreign subsidies would be required to notify the European Commission of their acquisitions of EU companies. Should the Commission determine that the acquisition is supported by the foreign subsidy and distorts the EU Market, it could accept commitments by the acquirer that effectively remedy the distortion or, as a last resort, it could prohibit the acquisition. The Commission could also apply the EU Interest Test and decide to not pursue the investigation further. Module 3 targets distortions created by foreign subsidies in the context of public procurement procedures, which may provide bidders with the unfair advantage of obtaining public contracts thanks to bids below market price or even below cost. Under this module, bidders would have an obligation to notify the contracting authority of financial contributions granted by non-EU countries. To prevent economic operators from failing to comply with the notification obligation and avoid the submission of incorrect information, the White Paper suggests the adoption of deterrent tools, such as significant fines and, as a last resort, the exclusion from the procurement procedure or the termination of an ongoing contract. If the contracting and supervisory authorities establish that the bidder benefitted from a foreign subsidy, which made the procurement procedure unfair, they would exclude the bidder from the procurement procedure. To ensure that economic operators compete on an equal footing when applying for EU financial support, the White Paper proposes options to prevent unfair advantages stemming from foreign subsidies in such context as well.Finally, the document stresses that international financial institutions implementing projects supported by the EU budget, such as the European Investment Bank, should reflect the Commission approach to foreign subsidies in their processes.Stakeholders will be able to submit their input on the options presented in the White Paper via apublic consultation[17], which will be open until 23 September 2020. The outcome of the consultation will guide the Commission in setting out legislative proposals to tackle the distortive effects of foreign subsidies on the EU Market.Copyright 2020 K &amp;#38; L Gates

Caramello Alvarez[5] Alessandro Di Mario[6] K&amp;#38;L Gates[7] European Regulatory / UK Regulatory Newsletter[8] Antitrust and CompetitionThe Failing Firm Defense in the Face of the COVID-19 Outbreak As the COVID-19 pandemic causes commercial and financial difficulties, an increasing number of transactions may involve companies in financial difficulty. This may lead to more transactions where antitrust authorities come under pressure to approve acquisitions that would ensure the survival of those companies. In the context of transactions involving distressed targets, the 'failing firm defense' (FFD) is often raised but is rarely successful in practice. The rationale of the FFD is that the deterioration of the competitive structure of the market that follows the merger is not caused by the transaction but by the prevailing economic conditions affecting the target.The European Commission (Commission) relies on three criteria in order to assess whether an FFD is likely to succeed: (i) the failing firm would in the near future be forced to exit the market due to financial difficulties if it is not taken over by another company; (ii) there is no less anticompetitive alternative than the proposed merger; and (iii) in the absence of the proposed merger, the assets of the failing firm would inevitably exit the market.As an example, in 2013, the Commission cleared the acquisition of a Greek air carrier by another Greek air carrier, taking into account the FFD. </p><p>In particular, the Commission upheld the argument that the continuous Greek recession had put the company under financial difficulties and that the air carrier to be acquired was likely to exit the market in any event. The Commission's market investigation revealed that there were no operators interested in acquiring the acquired carrier's assets in the event the company would leave the market. Furthermore, the acquired carrier's market shares on the relevant air routes would, in any event, accrue to the acquiring carrier since the parties were already in a quasi-duopoly situation, and entry by a third operator was considered to be unlikely in the foreseeable future.The standard of proof that the parties must meet for a successful FFD is very high, and the Commission's economic analysis is necessarily complex. To date, the Commission has accepted the FFD in three cases only.Although there have been calls for the Commission (and other antitrust authorities) to relax their approach to the FFD, it is very unlikely that the Commission will lower its legal standards for the FFD in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Commission made it clear in the context of the 2008 crisis that the proposition that a more lenient FFD test should be applied in times of recession must be rejected just as much as the proposition that a tougher test should be applied in good times.Similarly, in April 2020, Commission's Executive Vice-President and Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager excluded a more permissive approach and warned that the crisis 'shouldn't be a shield to allow mergers that would hurt consumers and hold back the recovery.' Significantly, her comments followed guidance issued by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which had recently approved a transaction on FFD grounds but shortly after reiterated its framework and stated that '[t]heCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has not brought about any relaxation of the standards by which mergers are assessed or the CMA's investigational standards.'However, even where an FFD argument is unlikely to succeed, companies may instead want to rely on the availability of a broader set of 'counterfactual' arguments regarding the competitive landscape and market position of the merging parties in the absence of the transaction. For instance, the Commission's decisional practice indicates that transactions can be cleared where the alternative counterfactual scenario clearly demonstrates that the exit of the target's assets from the market would be more harmful to competition than allowing the transaction to proceed. This kind of arguments may be expected to play a more pronounced role in the aftermath of COVID-19 where merging parties can demonstrate significant and long-lasting changes in market conditions. Digital Economy A New 'Gatekeeper' Law for Tech Giants?Margrethe Vestager, the EU's antitrust and digital policy chief, has called into question whether current competition rules are 'fit for purpose' in tackling online markets. Due to fast innovation and network effects, these markets can become anticompetitive very fast, she claimed, before warning Big Tech businesses that in the future, they may face an order to open up access to their data sets. The theory is that opening access to data sets would allow smaller rivals better chances to enter the market. These issues may be addressed in the much-awaited proposal for an EU Digital Services Act. The Commission is set to soon publish two consultation documents that will inform the drafting of the rules.The first consultation will propose a new 'gatekeeper' law, which would set out new obligations on large online platform operators. The new regulation would put 'clear-cut prohibitions and obligations on those who may qualify as digital gatekeepers.' The law would build on existing legislation, in particular the Platform to Businesses (P2B) Regulation that was adopted last year and which will start to be applied in July 2020. The latter governs the relationship between businesses and digital platforms and is largely designed to ensure predictability and transparency. Vestager has made the point numerous times that special responsibilities should be put on 'gatekeepers,' i.e., online marketplaces that have achieved such a strong position in the distribution chain that they have become de facto regulators.In a nutshell, a new gatekeeper law would mean that digital 'gatekeepers' could face scrutiny over their use of combined data sets, rolling out digital IDs, and hoarding data. This could mean that Big Tech businesses will have to 'separate clearly' their roles as the owner and the user of a platform.The second consultation is due to address a new 'competition tipping tool.' The tool is aimed at identifying structural problems in emerging markets, giving authorities the ability to intervene before they have 'tipped' to a certain company. Market tipping refers to the situation where one company obtains high 'monopoly' profits and market share, creating an anticompetitive environment for other firms.According to the Commission, the proposal for a Digital Services Act continues to be planned for publication later this year, although a slight delay to the first quarter of 2021 is possible. Ten EU Member States Make Recommendations on the Digital Services Act On 13 May 2020, the EU countries forming the 'Digital 9+' (Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden)published their contribution[9]to the debate on the review of regulatory framework for the provision of online services in the EU.The Digital 9+ countries noted that the current legal environment is obsolete, as it is largely based on the E-Commerce Directive, which was adopted 20 years ago. To address the new challenges, based on new digital business models, services, and technologies, the upcoming Digital Services Act should provide an improved regulatory framework for the digital economy. The review should be evidence-based and benefit from stakeholders' points of view. While the core principles of theE-Commerce Directive[10](e.g., the country of origin principle, exemption from liability for the stored content, and no general obligation to monitor information) should be maintained, they should be also modernized in a targeted manner.The crucial adaptation should be around the introduction of a notice-and-action mechanism framework across the EU. The framework should encompass measures proportionate to the nature and impact of the harm committed, enable swift and effective removal of the clearly illegal content, and ensure appropriate balance between the interests of those reporting illegal content and those posting content, making it possible to file a counter notice. The mechanism should provide intermediaries with an appropriate level of legal certainty while at the same time guarantee online users' rights to freedom of expression and information.Besides the notice-and-action mechanism, Digital 9+ countries also welcomed the Commission's reflection on the effectiveness of the application of the current competition rules, for example, in relation to antitrust remedies. Here, they put their emphasis on evidence-based solutions. European Parliament's Committees Published Three Draft Reports on the Digital Services Act The initial views of the European Parliament on the Digital Services Act started to crystalize in late April, as three Draft Reports with recommendations to the Commission were published.The Commission outlined its general strategy towards digital regulation in its Communication on 'Shaping Europe's digital future[11],' where it committed to strengthen the responsibility of online platforms, reinforce the oversight over platforms' content policies, and review options for an ex ante regulation for 'gate-keeping' platforms. The initial position of the European Parliament started to emerge only recently.In late April, the European Parliament published three Draft Reports with recommendations to the Commission on Digital Services Act (DSA): Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee's Draft Report focused on improving the functioning of the Single Market - Rapporteur: Alex Agius Saliba (IMCO Report[12]); Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs' Draft Report on issues concerning fundamental rights - Rapporteur: Kris Peeters (LIBE Report[13]); and Committee on Legal Affairs' Draft Report on adapting commercial and civil law rules for commercial entities operating online - Rapporteur: Tiemo W\u00f6lken (JURI Report[14]).The IMCO Report proposes to build the DSA upon the rules currently applicable to online platforms, namely theE-Commerce Directive[15]and thePlatform-to-Business Regulation[16]. A comprehensive revision of the E-Commerce Directive would aim to address the liability of an intermediary (e.g., clear due diligence transparency and information obligations, as well as procedures and measures related to the removal of illegal content online).With regard to platform regulation, the IMCO Report suggests that the DSA should ensure that the systemic role of specific online platforms will not endanger the internal market by unfairly excluding innovative new entrants. Large platforms with significant network effects that are able to act as de facto online gatekeepers should have special responsibilities. In particular, the IMCO Report suggests setting up an ex ante mechanism to prevent unfair market behavior by systemic platforms. Such mechanism should allow regulatory authorities to impose remedies on these companies in order to address market failures without the establishment of a breach of regulatory rules.The LIBE Report calls for addressing illegal content online with the same rigor as offline content, without disproportionate restrictions on the freedom of expression. With regard to the revision of the E-Commerce Directive, it recommends keeping the prohibition of a general monitoring obligation, limited liability for content, and the internal market clause in order to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens. At the same time, it proposes to introduce legal obligations for digital service providers' accountability for content moderation, as well as proactive measures to address the appearance of illegal content on their services. Finally, the LIBE Report also stresses that illegal content should not only be taken down, but also followed up by law enforcement and the judiciary.The JURI Report takes the view that the DSA should render the principle of 'notice-and-action' effective and workable by laying down a clear procedural framework for notice-and-action procedures which allow for effective judicial redress. The framework, which should be also enshrined in the terms and conditions of content hosting platform, shall be without prejudice to liability exemption rules under the E-Commerce Directive. Namely, the DSA must not contain any provisions that force or otherwise lead content hosting platforms to employ automated precontrol of content or other automated ex ante content moderation tools.In order to monitor and ensure legal compliance, the JURI Report suggests creating a new European agency with the power to impose fines on those content-hosting platforms breaching standards in their content management practices. Content-hosting platforms should also regularly transmit transparency reports to the agency. The JURI Report also recommends adopting measures to curtail the collection of data collected for building targeted advertisement profiles and to give users an appropriate degree of control over the content curation algorithms.The Draft Reports are now subject to further amendments and will be finalized in the coming months. The European Parliament's adoption of the DSA Reports is currently scheduled for fall 2020. Economic and Financial AffairsEuropean Supervisory Authorities Consult on Draft Investor Environmental, Social, and Governance Disclosure Standards On 23 April 2020, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESA) (i.e., the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), issued aconsultation[17]seeking input on the content, methodology, and presentation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures standards for financial market participants, advisers, and products. The consultation follows ESMA's recentreport[18]on enforcement and corporate reporting underlying that almost all issuers in its sample (77 percent) provided sufficient description of their policy for addressing environmental matters.The ESAs were mandated by theEU Regulation on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector[19](SFDR) to develop these standards. The SFDR aims to achieve more transparency on how financial market participants and advisers consider sustainability risks (so-called ESG considerations) in their investment decision-making process and how these decisions affect sustainability factors (adverse impact).The SFDR covers a wide range of financial products and financial market participants, including, inter alia, pan-European pension products, AIFMs, UCITs management companies, investment firms authorized under MiFID II providing portfolio management or investment advice and VC funds. For this reason, the ESAs highlight that its broad scope coupled with the absence of harmonized EU rules on sustainability-related disclosures indicate that diverging measures will continue to be adopted by EU Member States.In this context, the overall objective of the regulatory standards is to ensure that financial market participants and financial advisers disclose necessary information on the adverse impacts of investment decisions and financial advice to enable end investors to make informed investment decisions. The adoption of the regulatory standards is expected by 31 December 2020. Most of the SFDR's provisions shall apply from 10 March 2021, while the disclosure requirements for financial products will apply as from 1 January 2022.Stakeholders are invited to provide input on the consultation until 1 September 2020.The draft standards include: The publication of a statement on an entity's website on the due-diligence policy in respect of the adverse impact of investment decisions on sustainability factors and a mandatory reporting template for the website statement considering the principal adverse impact of investment decisions on sustainability factors. The draft standards indicate where and how this information should be published on the website including a two-page summary and the financial product's alignment with the 'do not significantly harm' (DNSH) principle. Periodic reporting depending on the specific product legislation, including a granular list of items to be added in the reporting, focusing on the success of the product's sustainable investment objective and its compliance with the DNSH principle. Precontractual disclosures on how a product with environmental or social characteristics meets them and if an index has been designated as a reference benchmark, and whether and how that index is consistent with those characteristics. In case there is a designated index, additional precontractual information will be needed on how that index is aligned with the sustainable investment objective.Details of the presentation and content of the information are to be disclosed in relation to the DNSH principle, including a mandatory template for adverse impact reporting and indicators setting out 'significant harm'. Financial Stability Board Report to the G20 on COVID-19 International Policy Response On 15 April 2020, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued a report to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors onInternational Cooperation and Coordination to address the financial stability implications from COVID-19[20]. The report follows aletter[21]by FSB Chair Randal K. Quarles, which points out the twin challenge the global financial system is facing in light of COVID-19: a dramatically increased need for credit throughout the global economy and marked uncertainty about the value of a wide range of assets.The report provides an overview of the financial stability implications related to COVID-19 and outlines the policy actions taken by FSB member jurisdictions. It notes that the FSB is monitoring the financial system's resilience and in particular, the ability of: (i) financial institutions and markets to channel funds to the real economy; (ii) market participants to obtain U.S.-dollar funding, particularly in emerging markets; (iii) financial intermediaries to manage liquidity risk; and (iv) market participants and financial market infrastructures, including central counterparties, to manage evolving counterparty risks. The report acknowledges that despite the current market volatility, the global financial system is more resilient as a result of the G20 regulatory reforms of the past years.In this context, it underscores that the financial sector's rapid and coordinated COVID-19 response to support the real economy, maintain financial stability, and minimize the risk of market fragmentation revolves around five principles. In aCommuniqu and Action Plan[22]published on the same day, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors expressed their support for the principles and committed to follow them. The principles include: Monitoring and sharing information on a timely basis to assess and address financial stability risks from COVID-19; The recognition and use of the flexibility built into existing financial standards to support the COVID-19 response; Opportunities to temporarily reduce operational burdens on firms and authorities such as delaying implementation deadlines, reprioritizing timetables for initiatives in other policy areas, or providing flexibility in technical compliance rules; Acting consistently with international standards, and not roll back reforms or compromise the underlying objectives of existing international standards; and Coordinating on the future timely unwinding of the temporary measures taken.The report also describes how the FSB is supporting international cooperation and coordination on the COVID-19 response by sharing information among financial authorities, conducting financial stability risk assessments, and assisting its members with coordinating on their responses to policy issues. In terms of next steps, the FSB stresses that even in view of COVID-19, it is important not to lose sight of what will be needed to promote a financial system that supports a strong recovery, including taking forward initiatives on nonbank financial intermediation, supporting a smooth transition away from LIBOR, harnessing the benefits of technological innovation, and promoting efficient and resilient cross-border payments. International Trade, Customs, and External RelationsEU Trade Defense Report: Restoring the Level Playing Field for European Producers On 30 April 2020, the Commission issued its 38th Annual Report highlighting key information regarding the EU's Anti-Dumping, Anti-Subsidy and Safeguard activities, as well as the trade defense activity of third countries targeting the EU in 2019.In its report, the Directorate General for Trade underlines in particular the following activities:Continued high level of EU trade defense activity: In 2019, the Commission increased its activity compared to 2018 by launching more investigations, imposing new measures, and by reviewing the existing ones.The highest number of EU trade defense measures concerns imports from third countries such as China, Russia, India, and the U.S.Increase in the number of EU jobs protected by defense measures: Dumped or subsidized imports affect EU companies, putting at risk the viability of EU businesses, and therefore of EU jobs. By restoring nonharmful conditions of trade, trade defense measures contribute to protecting jobs in EU companies. The measures imposed in 2019 increased the number of jobs benefitting from the EU trade defense by 23,000, bringing the total number of EU jobs protected to 343,000.Sustained effectiveness of EU trade defense measures in reducing unfair imports: An average 80% reduction of harmful imports allows EU producers to maintain their activity and to preserve the diversity of sources of supply.Resolute action to protect the EU steel market and recourse to new safeguard measures: Steel products were subject to the highest share of measures in force targeting the EU in 2019. In order to protect the fragile economic condition of EU steel producers and a further sharp increase of imports, the Commission adopted definitive safeguard measures for a range of steel products of all origins. In addition to the safeguard measures on steel products, the Commission also put in place safeguard measures for indica rice from Cambodia and Myanmar. These are the first safeguard measures set off by the EU in a long time.Strong defense of EU exporters targeted in foreign trade defense investigations: In 2019, measures taken by other countries against imports from the EU amounted to 175, and such a high level is expected to be maintained. The Commission continues to intervene regularly in the vast majority of foreign investigations targeting EU exports. In two notable cases regarding antisubsidy measures imposed by the U.S. on table olives from Spain and the measures on frozen fries, the Commission initiated trade dispute settlement before the World Trade Organization. Institutional AffairsThe Independence of the European Central Bank and the Authority of the Court of Justice of the European Union Called Into Question by the German Federal Constitutional Court On 5 May 2020, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVG), issued a decision on the legality of the European Central Bank's (ECB) Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). The PSPP was launched to stabilize the economy of the Eurozone (i.e., the economic region formed by the EU member countries that have adopted the euro) following the 2008 financial crisis. Since its adoption in 2015, it has allowed the ECB to purchase almost EUR 3 trillion of debt on secondary markets issued by all Eurozone countries. The BVG decision contradicts a 2018 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which upheld the validity of the ECB decision to pursue the PSPP.While the BVG dismissed the plaintiff's argument that the practice amounts to monetary financing, which is illegal under the EU treaties, it accepted the claim that the 2018 CJEU decision failed to demonstrate the fulfilment of the principle of proportionality. This is set by Article 5(1) and (4) of the Treaty on the EU and provides that the EU institutions can only pursue actions they can demonstrate are justified and necessary. According to the BVG reasoning, in pursuing the PSPP, the ECB focused exclusively on keeping inflation under control and failed to consider its social and economic impact. Accordingly, its action lacked sufficient consideration to proportionality and, with that, the ECB exceeded its powers.The BVG ruled that the Bundesbank (the German federal central bank) cannot participate in, execute, or operationalize ultra vires acts and hence cannot continue its participation in the PSPP unless a proportionality assessment, demonstrating an adequate justification for the PSPP, is provided within three months by the ECB. A Bundesbank withdrawal from the PSPP would probably force the ECB to halt the program altogether, with critical consequences for the euro.The BVG judgment risks jeopardizing the legitimacy of the CJEU and the primacy of EU law over national law. It represents a dangerous precedent for other countries to disregard the CJEU rulings when they disagree with them and, therefore, undermines the unity and certainty of the EU legal order. Furthermore, it challenges the independence of the ECB, which decides on the conditions for the exercise of its mandate under the exclusive supervision of the CJEU.The deadlock raises the question of how the EU can manage the situation while preventing further damages to its institutions and disruptions of the already precarious EU member states' relations. All of the options considered so far to overcome the stand-off seem to come with drawbacks.In particular, Ursula Von der Leyen, the President of the Commission, envisaged the opening of an infringement procedure against Germany. This option, however, is likely to cause an escalation of tension among the EU, Germany, and other EU Member States and may undermine the authority of the CJEU.At the same time, ignoring the BVG ruling could lead to the withdrawal of the Bundesbank from the PSPP, endangering the existence of the euro. Furthermore, considering that the BVG has been deemed Germany's most-trusted institution for decades, any attempt by Brussels to challenge its authority could trigger German hostility against the EU.On the other hand, if the ECB were to meet the BVG demand to provide a detailed analysis to prove the necessity of the PSPP, this could open the door to future illegitimate national intrusions in the ECB's policies.Observers suggest that an alternative to solve the institutional impasse might be found in an intervention of the Bundesbank submitting the analysis in place of the ECB. However, this option does not seem viable since the Bundesbank voted against the PSPP when it was approved by the ECB's governing council in 2015 and such a change may undermine its credibility.While the potential options discussed seem to all have distinct shortcomings, the August 5, 2020 deadline fixed by the BVG is approaching and a solution will need to be found before then.Copyright 2020 K

That\u2019s the core moment we are in,\u201d said\u00a0Vera Jourova, a European Commission vice-president, whose upcoming European Democracy Action Plan will tackle online disinformation and how to guarantee free and fair elections in the bloc. </p><p>\u201cI have to count with some resistance. Whatever we come up with will create more requirements which will mean more money, more people, more responsibility,\u201d she added, in an interview with the Financial Times. </p><p>She spoke as more than 300 submissions, including those from Facebook and Google, were made to the EU on the plan. Proposals for new regulations on political advertising and election periods are expected as soon as December. </p><p>In its submission to the EU, Facebook argued that there should be a level playing field, with all tech companies facing a similar regulatory burden, according to notes seen by the FT. It added that it has been proactive in tackling disinformation online. </p><p>But EU officials said a one-size-fits-all approach could \u201cchoke the smaller players\u201d in red tape. </p><p>The EU is also likely to increase its focus on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e479043f-a197-41f1-86c8-ff6c922e3492\"> disinformation </url>in the light of harmful rumours during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>\u201cWe have forgotten the manipulative power of disinformation,\u201d she said. \u201cDisinformation has the potential to create an easy-to-manipulate crowd\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe are not wasting time on stupid, innocent rumours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are dealing with something that has real potential to distract the people and to seduce them for some radical ideologies.\u201d</p><p>Separately, the EU is drawing up a new Digital Services Act, the flagship regulation for online platforms. One key battle is over how responsible tech companies should be for the content on their platform. </p><p>In its submission to the DSA, Google pushed back on how liable platforms should be for illegal content they have not been spotted. \u201cThe DSA should further clarify that services are not liable without actual knowledge,\u201d the submission read. </p><p>While there have been calls for a tougher line to force platforms to be more proactive, Ms Jourova warned that being too tough would have an adverse effect. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go too far in terms of liability because the platforms will use artificial intelligence to discover the cases in hate speech,\u201d she said. \u201cI am really mindful of (George) Orwell who said that totalitarian systems start when you start to control somebody\u2019s vocabulary.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-19ee88f983b04eb492d40325650376fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VC-2K41-DXP9-93TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

The company owns the world's largest ecommerce business and in Amazon Web Services, the world's biggest cloud computing business. It was founded by Jeff Bezos, a former hedge fund executive, in 1994 and quickly expanded from selling books to CDs and other goods before moving into cloud computing, gadgets and streaming video and music.</p><p>In the latest stage of the Brussels inquiry, commission officials will examine how Amazon uses data given by other merchants selling goods including how retailers qualify for the \"buy box\" button that allows customers to easily add products to their online shopping cart. It follows a preliminary investigation into Amazon's business practices that began last year, looking at the tension between the company's own retail business and its role as a host for rival third-party merchants.</p><p>\"It is an important move and a statement against the big tech giants,\" Andrea Collart, competition partner at Avisa Partners, said. \"The feeling is that Amazon is so present in so many markets that it is too big to regulate. Competition enforcement can be the sling used by David to defeat Goliath.\"</p><p>The opening of a formal investigation as a \"matter of priority\" follows the responses to questionnaires sent out by the commission to third-party retailers, which raised further concerns. These included the agreements that merchants must sign and how \"the use of accumulated marketplace seller data by Amazon as a retailer affects competition\".</p><p>\"If powerful platforms are found to use data they amass to get an edge over their competitors, both consumers and the market bear the cost,\" Johannes Kleis of Beuc, the European consumer organisation in Brussels, said.</p><p>The commission will examine how third-party retailers \"win\" the \"buy box\" button which privileges their goods when internet shoppers search for a specific product.</p><p>Commission officials will focus on Amazon's system of performancebased measures to determine which retailers get the lucrative click-through button.</p><p>\"The commission will now carry out its in-depth investigation as a matter of priority,\" it said in a statement. \"If proven, the practices under investigation may breach EU competition rules on anti-competitive agreements between companies.\"</p><p>Ms Vestager is coming to the end of her first five-year term as commissioner and will return to Brussels with a more high-profile role under its new president, Ursula von der Leyen, this autumn.

The company owns the world's largest ecommerce business and in Amazon Web Services, the world's biggest cloud computing business. It was founded by Jeff Bezos, a former hedge fund executive, in 1994 and quickly expanded from selling books to CDs and other goods before moving into cloud computing, gadgets and streaming video and music.</p><p>In the latest stage of the Brussels inquiry, commission officials will examine how Amazon uses data given by other merchants selling goods including how retailers qualify for the \"buy box\" button that allows customers to easily add products to their online shopping cart. It follows a preliminary investigation into Amazon's business practices that began last year, looking at the tension between the company's own retail business and its role as a host for rival third-party merchants.</p><p>\"It is an important move and a statement against the big tech giants,\" Andrea Collart, competition partner at Avisa Partners, said. \"The feeling is that Amazon is so present in so many markets that it is too big to regulate. Competition enforcement can be the sling used by David to defeat Goliath.\"</p><p>The opening of a formal investigation as a \"matter of priority\" follows the responses to questionnaires sent out by the commission to third-party retailers, which raised further concerns. These included the agreements that merchants must sign and how \"the use of accumulated marketplace seller data by Amazon as a retailer affects competition\".</p><p>\"If powerful platforms are found to use data they amass to get an edge over their competitors, both consumers and the market bear the cost,\" Johannes Kleis of Beuc, the European consumer organisation in Brussels, said.</p><p>The commission will examine how third-party retailers \"win\" the \"buy box\" button which privileges their goods when internet shoppers search for a specific product.</p><p>Commission officials will focus on Amazon's system of performance-based measures to determine which retailers get the lucrative click-through button.</p><p>\"The commission will now carry out its in-depth investigation as a matter of priority,\" it said in a statement. \"If proven, the practices under investigation may breach EU competition rules on anti-competitive agreements between companies.\"</p><p>Ms Vestager is coming to the end of her first five-year term as commissioner and will return to Brussels with a more high-profile role under its new president, Ursula von der Leyen, this autumn. Her time as the EU's competition watchdog and enforcer has been marked by record-breaking multibillion-euro fines and investigations into digital giants, including Google and Apple.</p><p>On Tuesday Amazon struck a deal with Germany and Austria in order to shut down competition inquiries into how it handled third-party merchants' data.</p><p>The company will change its business services agreement worldwide in mid- August to address a number of complaints with remedies likely to be echoed across the EU.</p><p>                   Q&amp;A                   What is Amazon Market Place?                   </p><p>Amazon launched its Market Place service in 1999 so that independent businesses could sell new or used products on its website. The service is meant to give small and medium-sized companies access to Amazon's global network of customers and it broadens the range of products sold on the site without Amazon having to invest in stock. Amazon typically gets a 15 per cent commission for Market Place purchases and takes about 30 per cent in fees on storage, delivery and inventory management programs.</p><p>                   Who uses Market Place?                   </p><p>There are more than five million Market Place sellers with roughly a quarter based in China. Electronics is the biggest category, with a quarter of Market Place sellers, followed by clothing and shoes. Amazon attributes the growth of the business to allowing independent retailers to use its warehouses and tools.</p><p>                   How big is it?                   </p><p>Since 2015 Amazon has made more money from letting other businesses sell products through its Market Place services than it did selling to customers itself. Third-party sellers account for 58 per cent of Amazon's retail business, making $160 billion last year. Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos said in his annual letter to shareholders that the division's growth meant \"third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt. Badly\". Last year the company launched a \"Marketplace growth program\" to offer better assistance for third-party sellers. The help program costs $2,500 a month for sellers taking less than $1 million in revenue while those making more than $10 million a year are charged $5,000 a month.</p><p>                   Why is the European Commission concerned?                   </p><p>Europe's competition watchdog is scrutinising Amazon's dual role as a retailer and host to third-party sellers because of its control over customer data. The commission will focus on Amazon's \"buy box\", which allows customers to move items from a retailer direct to their shopping basket. How those retailers qualify to be ranked in the spot will be analysed as it relies on Amazon's search functions, which use performance algorithms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-54556861</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKG-SGN1-F021-60D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><timeReceived>4:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The company owns the world's largest ecommerce business and in Amazon Web Services, the world's biggest cloud computing business. It was founded by Jeff Bezos, a former hedge fund executive, in 1994 and quickly expanded from selling books to CDs and other goods before moving into cloud computing, gadgets and streaming video and music.</p><p>In the latest stage of the Brussels inquiry, commission officials will examine how Amazon uses data given by other merchants selling goods including how retailers qualify for the \"buy box\" button that allows customers to easily add products to their online shopping cart. It follows a preliminary investigation into Amazon's business practices that began last year, looking at the tension between the company's own retail business and its role as a host for rival third-party merchants.</p><p>\"It is an important move and a statement against the big tech giants,\" Andrea Collart, competition partner at Avisa Partners, said. \"The feeling is that Amazon is so present in so many markets that it is too big to regulate. Competition enforcement can be the sling used by David to defeat Goliath.\"</p><p>The opening of a formal investigation as a \"matter of priority\" follows the responses to questionnaires sent out by the commission to third-party retailers, which raised further concerns. These included the agreements that merchants must sign and how \"the use of accumulated marketplace seller data by Amazon as a retailer affects competition\".</p><p>\"If powerful platforms are found to use data they amass to get an edge over their competitors, both consumers and the market bear the cost,\" Johannes Kleis of Beuc, the European consumer organisation in Brussels, said.</p><p>The commission will examine how third-party retailers \"win\" the \"buy box\" button which privileges their goods when internet shoppers search for a specific product.</p><p>Commission officials will focus on Amazon's system of performancebased measures to determine which retailers get the lucrative click-through button.</p><p>\"The commission will now carry out its in-depth investigation as a matter of priority,\" it said in a statement. \"If proven, the practices under investigation may breach EU competition rules on anti-competitive agreements between companies.\"</p><p>Ms Vestager is coming to the end of her first five-year term as commissioner and will return to Brussels with a more high-profile role under its new president, Ursula von der Leyen, this autumn. Her time as the EU's competition watchdog and enforcer has been marked by record-breaking multibillion-euro fines and investigations into digital giants, including Google and Apple.</p><p>On Tuesday Amazon struck a deal with Germany and Austria in order to shut down competition inquiries into how it handled third-party merchants' data. The company will change its business services agreement worldwide in mid-August to address a number of complaints with remedies likely to be echoed across the EU.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Margrethe Vestager has been accused of \"hating America\"</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-151180944</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-SDG1-DYTY-C1PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The company owns the world's largest ecommerce business and in Amazon Web Services, the world's biggest cloud computing business. It was founded by Jeff Bezos, a former hedge fund executive, in 1994 and quickly expanded from selling books to CDs and other goods before moving into cloud computing, gadgets and streaming video and music.</p><p>In the latest stage of the Brussels inquiry, commission officials will examine how Amazon uses data given by other merchants selling goods including how retailers qualify for the \"buy box\" button that allows customers to easily add products to their online shopping cart. It follows a preliminary investigation into Amazon's business practices that began last year, looking at the tension between the company's own retail business and its role as a host for rival third-party merchants.</p><p>\"It is an important move and a statement against the big tech giants,\" Andrea Collart, competition partner at Avisa Partners, said. \"The feeling is that Amazon is so present in so many markets that it is too big to regulate. Competition enforcement can be the sling used by David to defeat Goliath.\"</p><p>The opening of a formal investigation as a \"matter of priority\" follows the responses to questionnaires sent out by the commission to third-party retailers, which raised further concerns. These included the agreements that merchants must sign and how \"the use of accumulated marketplace seller data by Amazon as a retailer affects competition\".</p><p>\"If powerful platforms are found to use data they amass to get an edge over their competitors, both consumers and the market bear the cost,\" Johannes Kleis of Beuc, the European consumer organisation in Brussels, said.</p><p>The commission will examine how third-party retailers \"win\" the \"buy box\" button which privileges their goods when internet shoppers search for a specific product.</p><p>Commission officials will focus on Amazon's system of performancebased measures to determine which retailers get the lucrative click-through button.</p><p>\"The commission will now carry out its in-depth investigation as a matter of priority,\" it said in a statement. \"If proven, the practices under investigation may breach EU competition rules on anti-competitive agreements between companies.\"</p><p>Ms Vestager is coming to the end of her first five-year term as commissioner and will return to Brussels with a more high-profile role under its new president, Ursula von der Leyen, this autumn. Her time as the EU's competition watchdog and enforcer has been marked by record-breaking multibillion-euro fines and investigations into digital giants, including Google and Apple.</p><p>On Tuesday Amazon struck a deal with Germany and Austria in order to shut down competition inquiries into how it handled third-party merchants' data. The company will change its business services agreement worldwide in mid-August to address a number of complaints with remedies likely to be echoed across the EU.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Margrethe Vestager has been accused of \"hating America\"</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-151176137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-SDG1-DYTY-C17W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The timing could hardly be more sensitive. In the US, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, is facing an open revolt within his company over how he handles Donald Trump\u2019s social media posts. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has only intensified attention on the dangers of online disinformation. </p><p>The Financial Times has seen a draft of the consultation \u2014 and here are the three main themes it will seek to address:\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who is responsible for what?</emphasis></p><p>How responsible should the big platforms be for content published on their sites or goods sold online? <br/><br/>The latter point has been magnified by the pandemic as internet users have been tricked into buying faulty protective equipment or medical products with the false pretence that they can protect them against the virus. <br/><br/>The central question, says one EU official, is \u201cwhat\u2019s the responsibility of the platforms to ensure that this stuff is good quality?\u201d </p><p>There is a delicate balance to be struck, say experts. Online commerce platform eBay, for example, never comes into contact with the material being sold on its platform. \u201cHow can they be liable for it?\u201d said one EU official. </p><p>Still, Brussels will come up with ways to push companies such as Amazon to be more responsive if customers flag non-compliant products, people with direct knowledge of the EU\u2019s plans say. </p><p>Currently, platforms can take action on a voluntary basis. There are no legal sanctions if they don\u2019t remove the products or don\u2019t do it quickly enough. <br/><br/>EU regulators want platforms to work harder at delisting bad actors.</p><p>\u201cPlatforms don\u2019t have a lot of incentives to do such checks because ultimately they make money on commissions,\u201d said a person with direct knowledge of the Digital Services Act consultation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How should tech giants be curbed?</emphasis></p><p>As part of the consultation the EU will also examine what fair competition looks like in an era where platforms have dominant positions online and high barriers to entry for smaller rivals. </p><p>Some have criticised EU regulators for acting too slowly or not doing enough to curtail the growing might of companies such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>Under pressure, Brussels will set clear \u201cdos and don\u2019ts\u201d as part of the new rules. For example, Big Tech companies will probably be forced to share data with smaller rivals and make it easier for users to take their data elsewhere.</p><p>One question concerns the potential of Big Tech to diminish consumer choice. A draft paper asks respondents whether they agree with the statement: \u201cIt is easy for consumers to switch between services provided by platform companies.\u201d </p><p>But don\u2019t expect the EU to push for a break-up of dominant players such as Google or Facebook. \u201cThat\u2019s a step too far,\u201d said another person with direct knowledge of the consultation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to complete the single market? </emphasis></p><p>What other measures are needed to line up rules governing online commerce across the EU? This is a key question for Brussels, which is acutely aware that the EU has been far from unified in its approach to the rules of the internet. </p><p>France, for instance, recently adopted new controversial rules giving online platforms just one hour to delete terrorist content. Germany also passed its own hate speech laws, which force companies to hand over the IP addresses of those publishing hateful content.</p><p>EU officials are upset by individual moves by member states at a time when the bloc wants to come up with common rules.</p><p>\u201cThere are centrifugal forces that are pulling the EU apart everywhere but they\u2019re also spilling into the digital policy area,\u201d said a person with direct knowledge of the internet rules overhaul.</p><p>\u201cWe lost a bit of tempo because these countries didn\u2019t work towards common EU rules.

And on the Western Front, to some big tech issues, like Facebook and Google or Amazon, that don't filter those hoaxes.</p><p><br/>In an effort to remedy an increasingly difficult situation, the European Commission has asked platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter to provide evidence each month of their efforts against disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that the russia-China contingency can be better catalogued.<br/>The seriousness of the matter has led Brussels to also call for the cooperation of NATO and the G7, as contained in the plan unveiled by the EU's high representative for foreign policy, Josep Borrell, and the Community Vice-President for Securities and Transparency, Vera Jourov\u00e1.<br/>\"In the time of the coronavirus, misinformation can kill. We have a duty to protect our citizens by sensitizing them to the existence of false information and to point out to the actors responsible for these practices,\" Borrell said at a press conference, as EFE says.<br/>More misinformation on the Internet<br/>The Commission has a fairly clear stance on the role of fake news and misinformation on the Internet: it is somewhat conducive to \"foreign\" actors and seeks to influence national debates in the EU, on the basis of \"the most basic anxieties of citizens\".<br/>Brussels has held the platforms responsible for enasing that these messages do not spread massively. Facebook, Twitter, Google and other major technology will need to send monthly reports with detailed data on actions taken to promote content from authorized sources, strengthen user awareness and limit misinformation about the coronavirus and all associated advertising.<br/>They should also intensify cooperation with data-checking authorities in all Member States and with researchers, although there is no further regulation of this company time at the moment. What they are looking for from Europe is greater transparency.<br/>\"They have to give us more so that we can see that the measurements work. We want more transparency (...) to be regularly informed of efforts against disinformation about COVID-19,\" he explained on Tuesday in statements to a group of international media, including Efe, Jourov\u00e1.<br/>The EC appreciates the efforts of platforms such as Twitter, which in February launched a new alert service, which is highlighted when searching for information about the coronavirus, first displaying accurate and authoritative information, as well as Facebook - owner of Instagram and Whatsapp - proposed by the WHO website. Despite the progress \"much remains to be done\", according to Jourov\u00e1.<br/>In the monthly reports Brussels wants data on the nature of misinformation, dimension, the audience it addresses and other details, the commissioner said.<br/>The document published today reviews the measures taken to date in the fight against misinformation and lessons learned from the coronavirus crisis.<br/>To prevent these messages from warming citizens, the European Commission advocates working with civil society, increasing surveillance and supporting the media, which \"are at the forefront of the fight against misinformation,\" Jourov\u00e1 said.<br/>RUSSIA AND CHINA, ORIGIN OF MISINFORMATION<br/>Russia and China are behind many of the hoaxes, misinformation and other forms of manipulation and distortions of news that are spreading during the pandemic of thecoronavirus, according to a report by the EU's special unit monitoring this phenomenon.<br/>\"We clearly mention Russia and China and have enough evidence to do so,\" Jourov\u00e1 said.<br/>There are also \"national actors\" involved in the dissemination of this information, different extremist groups, political forces with nationalist programmes, groups with the intention of creating distortion and violence.<br/>It's not easy to follow them and sometimes it's not possible to get to their origin, \"that's why we want more information from the platforms and ask for more transparency,\" Jourov\u00e1 said.<br/>The proposed actions are part of the EU's future work on misinformation, in particular the European Democratic Action Plan and the Digital Services Act, which Brussels will present this year.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-12690712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603T-V121-JBJN-M1M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Catch up on this week's top stories highlighting the intersection of these old guard and new school areas of finance with this recap compiled by The Fly: 1. SEC ISSUES WARNING: On Thursday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton issued a statement commending the North American Securities Administrators Association for \"highlighting important issues and concerns related to cryptocurrencies.\" The SEC's statement reads in part, \"NASAA's release is a timely and thoughtful reminder to Main Street investors to exercise caution. The release recognizes that cryptocurrencies, while touted as replacements for traditional currencies, lack many important characteristics of traditional currencies...and now are being promoted more as investment opportunities than efficient mediums for exchange. </p><p>The NASAA release also reminds investors that when they are offered and sold securities they are entitled to the benefits of state and federal securities laws...Unfortunately, it is clear that many promoters of ICOs and others participating in the cryptocurrency-related investment markets are not following these laws. The SEC and state securities regulators are pursuing violations, but we again caution you that, if you lose money, there is a substantial risk that our efforts will not result in a recovery of your investment.\" 2. MERRILL LYNCH BANS BITCOIN TRADING: Bank of America's (BAC) Merrill Lynch has prohibited clients and financial advisers who trade on their behalf from purchasing bitcoin due to concerns over the suitability of the cryptocurrency, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The ban, which expands a current policy banning access to bitcoin futures, applies to all accounts and prohibits advisers from pitching bitcoin-related investments and executing trades in the Grayscale Investment Trust bitcoin fund. 3. CFTC COMMITTEES TO DISCUSS CRYPTO OVERSIGHT: On Thursday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo issued a statement announcing that the Market Risk Advisory Committee would meet on January 31 and the Technology Advisory Committee would meet on January 23 in relation to virtual currencies. The MRAC will consider the process of self-certification of new products and operational rules by Designated Contract Markets under the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations while TAC will discuss the challenges, opportunities, and market developments of virtual currencies. Giancarlo said, \"Undoubtedly, virtual currency and virtual currency derivatives present both significant opportunities and challenges. As a Federal market regulator, the CFTC is cognizant of the considerable risks of virtual currencies like Bitcoin...One thing is certain: ignoring virtual currency trading will not make it go away. Nor is it a responsible regulatory strategy. The CFTC has an important role to play. The CFTC seeks to promote responsible innovation and development that is consistent with its statutory mission to enhance derivative trading markets and to prohibit fraud and manipulation in connection with commodities in interstate commerce.\" 4. FACEBOOK MULLS CRYPTOCURRENCY: In a Facebook (FB) post on Thursday announcing his yearly goals, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he will look into new technologies like encryption and cryptocurrencies. \"One of the most interesting questions in technology right now is about centralization vs decentralization,\" he said. \"With the rise of a small number of big tech companies - and governments using technology to watch their citizens - many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it. There are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency -- that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.\" 5. THIEL'S FOUNDERS FUND BETS ON BITCOIN: Founders Fund, a venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin across some of its most recent funds, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. The firm bought roughly $15M to $20M in bitcoin and told investors the holdings are now worth hundreds of millions but also warned that the digital currency may end up worth nothing. It is unclear if the fund has sold any of its holdings. 6. BURGER BLOCKCHAIN: On Tuesday, Mobivity Holdings (MFON) and Chanticleer Holdings (BURG) announced plans to use MobivityMind, a blockchain-architected platform, to power Chanticleer's cryptocurrency customer loyalty and rewards program. \"Eating a burger is now a way to mine for cryptocoins! Every meal enjoyed at any Chanticleer Holdings brand will accrue currency for the consumer that can be used for future meals or traded with other consumers,\" said Mobivity CEO Dennis Becker. The program will start in mid-2018 and is expected to be fully deployed across all Chanticleer brands before year-end. 7. BITCOIN STOCK PLAYS: Cryptocurrency revenues have been pointed to as reasons to be bullish on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) in select research. Overstock (OSTK), Digital Power (DPW), Long Blockchain (LBCC), Seven Stars Cloud Group (SSC), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Longfin (LFIN), Pareteum (TEUM) and Social Reality (SRAX) are other stocks that have been touted, or promoted themselves, as a way to play the crypto theme. PRICE ACTION: As of time of writing, bitcoin rose about 12% this week to $16,477 in U.S. dollars according to CoinDesk. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices rose 11.3% to $11.75, Nvidia was up 9.1% to $213.02, Overstock rose 26.3% to $82.95, Seven Stars Cloud Group dropped 18.5% to $4.34, Riot Blockchain rose 4.6% to $25.35 and Pareteum surged about 113% to $2.70 all on a weekly basis.

That separation would make the nationalisation of Openreach much simpler but taking the business into state ownership would be a daunting proposition.</p><p>Openreach employs about 32,000 staff - almost a third of BT's global workforce - and has a turnover of about \u00a35bn.</p><p>It is responsible for the rollout of full fibre across the UK, which at an estimated cost of \u00a335bn is the biggest infrastructure project after the HS2 rail project.</p><p> Is BT's pension deficit an issue? </p><p>Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, examined the possibility of breaking up BT in 2016 and cited BT's \u00a34.5bn pension deficit as one of the reasons why it would not be a good idea. Steve Unger, Ofcom's director of strategy, said at the time a full-blown separation would trigger \"very significant costs\" related to the deficit.</p><p> You can read the full piece here: </p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/nov/15/bt-claims-labour-nationalisation-plan-cost-100bn-business-live?page=with:block-5dcd970d8f083559fb1cb7e0#block-5dcd970d8f083559fb1cb7e0\">How feasible is Labour's free broadband plan and part-nationalisation of BT?</url></p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.20pm GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 12.52pm GMT </p><p>BT's share price has been shifting all morning, but its stock is no longer the worst performer on the FTSE 100.  </p><p>Its shares fell as much as 3% in early trading, hitting lows of about 189p but have slightly recovered. </p><p>The telecom giant's shares are now down 1.7% and hovering around 191p per share.</p><p>BT's share price has been shifting.

Thanks for reading and have a great weekend. We'll be back on Monday. The main US markets have opened and all three have hit new record highs: S&amp;P 500 +0.41% at 3,109 points Nasdaq +0.53% at 8,524 points Dow +0.36% at 27,881 points DATA ALERT: US industrial output contracted -0.8% in October. That's a larger contraction than was forecasted by analysts, who were expecting a -0.4% drop. It is also worse than September's -0.3% fall. NEWSFLASH: Engineering firm Babcock have been awarded the contract to build to the next fleet of warships for the UK defence ministry. It will be working on a fleet of five ships for the Royal Navy at its Rosyth facility, at an average cost of \u00a3250m each. Babcock was named the preferred bidder back in September. Analysts from investment bank Jefferies say BT could launch a legal challenge if Labour attempts to nationalise part of the business. The note, written by Jerry Dellis, Ulrich Rathe and Martin Hammerschmidt, explains: In a nationalisation scenario, we understand that BT's most effective legal recourse might be to defend shareholder value, not attempt to block government policy. The UK has bilateral investment treaties with countries in which overseas BT shareholders are located, and these are intended to protect against asset expropriation. UK-based shareholders might expect to receive equal treatment. NEWSFLASH: US retail sales rose +0.3% in October. That is higher than consensus forecasts for a +0.2% rise and an improvement on the -0.3% fall in September. Excluding car sales, the numbers were slightly disappointing, up just +0.2% compared to expectations for a +0.4% increase. But it's still better than September when retail sales contracted by -0.1%. My colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson have put together a comprehensive Q&amp;A on the feasibility of the Labour broadband policy, covering key issues including whether the policy would breach state aid rules: Could the policy fall foul of policies on state aid? The EU has strict rules against state aid - or government subsidies that benefit one EU company at the expense of others - but according to some commentators, there are no regulations against businesses becoming entirely state-owned. How easy would it be to nationalise BT? Labour's plans do not involve nationalising all of BT, just Openreach, which operates the UK's broadband network, and other parts that relate to broadband provision, such as the retail arm BT Consumer. Openreach was set up as a subsidiary of BT in 2006 but two years ago was legally separated from its parent company by the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to counter complaints from rivals that its lack of independence was limiting competition in the market. That separation would make the nationalisation of Openreach much simpler but taking the business into state ownership would be a daunting proposition. Openreach employs about 32,000 staff - almost a third of BT's global workforce - and has a turnover of about \u00a35bn. It is responsible for the rollout of full fibre across the UK, which at an estimated cost of \u00a335bn is the biggest infrastructure project after the HS2 rail project. Is BT's pension deficit an issue? Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, examined the possibility of breaking up BT in 2016 and cited BT's \u00a34.5bn pension deficit as one of the reasons why it would not be a good idea. Steve Unger, Ofcom's director of strategy, said at the time a full-blown separation would trigger \"very significant costs\" related to the deficit. You can read the full piece here: BT's share price has been shifting all morning, but its stock is no longer the worst performer on the FTSE 100. Its shares fell as much as 3% in early trading, hitting lows of about 189p but have slightly recovered. The telecom giant's shares are now down 1.7% and hovering around 191p per share. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson has said: The group welcomes the Court's decision. Throughout this process, the group has sought to act in the interests of our shareholders as a whole. To refresh your memories, Lloyds announced the takeover of HBOS on 18 September 2008. Claimants said they suffered substantial financial losses as a result of the deal, Their lawyers claimed Lloyds had been bullied into the takeover by Gordon Brown's government, which hoped to save struggling HBOS The government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group but no longer owns any shares after selling its final tranche in May 2017. The Press Association is reporting that shareholders have lost a high court battle over the 2008 takeover of HBOS. The case was brought by almost 6,000 private investors who claimed they were not provided with the full details about the financial health of HBOS before the deal went through. While the big tech giants will be taxed to help fund the broadband scheme, McDonnell says the cash will actually be funding the infrastructure that their businesses run on: Yes, tech giants like Google and Facebook will have to pay a bit more for internet connectivity that they all benefit from. Labour's John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is back on the telly, giving the next speech at the party's event in Lancaster. He said the broadband plan would benefit businesses which are both using and developing 5G technologies. Let's be clear, it's not a return to the 1970s... This is public ownership of the future. If you prefer to take a listen, ITV have some clips from Corbyn's speech: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has hailed the party's broadband pledge during a speech in Lancaster. He said it would just be the next in a string of successful nationalisation of essential services in the UK: In the 19th century, it was the public water supply and water works...in the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service...British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century. Britain's leading business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry believes Labour's plan is not the the way to improve broadband across the UK. Matthew Fell, CBI's Chief UK Policy Director, says: Fast reliable broadband is an absolute priority for people and firms and does need improving. But Labour's plan is not the way to do it. The roll out of full fibre broadband across the country is underway, and all renationalisation will achieve is to slow down a process that needs speeding up. It is private sector investment that has driven connectivity, massively widened internet access and put faster speeds within reach for most UK households. This progress will be stopped in its tracks and the bill passed to pensioners and savers. Fell adds: With so many challenges facing the UK, blinkered ideologies must be left behind and replaced by forward-looking public-private partnerships that deliver rather than delay. As the scope of Labour's radical re-nationalisation plans expands almost daily, firms around the world lose confidence in the UK as a place to invest safely. Some will be asking if they are next. This threat damages the livelihoods of communities across the country. It's time for all parties to work with business, not against it. My colleague Rajeev Syal has rounded up key comments from shadow chancellor John McDonnell's media tour this morning. Labour's view on the benefits: It doesn't just have economic benefits. It has environmental benefits in terms of basically people locating in their local towns and not commuting, some people moving into rural and coastal areas as well so they're properly connected, and it has social implications as well. On whether staff would be paid at the same rate as BT: We will always ensure that we attract the talent that we need. On Labour's intention to tax big technology companies to fund the policy, McDonnell said: We're not being unfair to anyone, we're simply saying you make your profits here, on the percentage of the profits you make here, you pay your taxes properly. On rival companies: McDonnell said he hoped to come to an agreement with rival broadband companies such as Sky and TalkTalk over ensuring access, and if necessary they could \"come within the ambit of British Broadband\". We'll come to an agreement with them, either an agreement of access arrangements or working alongside us, or, yes, if necessary they can then come within the ambit of British Broadband itself. BT competitor Virgin Media has weighed in. It's taken a subtle swipe at nationalisation proposals, saying that private - not public - investment is to thank for its own growth and success. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: Virgin Media has the fastest scaled network in the UK and has pledged to bring next-generation Gigabit broadband to half of the UK, by the end of 2021. As this commitment shows, private investment is essential to delivering improved broadband infrastructure. With billions of pounds worth of private money invested in the UK, Virgin Media continues to expand its network, providing competition and choice to consumers. Government policy has a role to play and can help to accelerate broadband deployment in a way that minimises the level of public subsidy needed and provides the UK and consumers with incredible connectivity within a competitive market. Amidst the flurry of reaction and commentary to Labour's BT pledge, we've had the final reading of eurozone inflation released this morning. The 19-country bloc's headline inflation slowed to 0.7% year-on-year in October, from 0.8% in September. That's line with preliminary estimates by Eurostat. The drop was caused by a fall in energy prices, which offset higher prices for services, food, alcohol and tobacco. NEWSFLASH: In other BT news, the telecoms giant has won the exclusive rights to broadcast all 420 games of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and the new UEFA Europa Conference League fora further three seasons. BT will pay \u00a3400m each year for the privilege, but says its financial outlook for 2019/2020 remains unchanged. Unsurprisingly, the prime minister has strongly criticised Labour's pre-election pledge, and made it clear there will be no similar efforts by the Tories. Boris told BBC radio: What we won't be doing is some crackpot scheme that would involve many, many tens of billions of taxpayers' money nationalising a British business Labour plans to fund the nationalisation by swapping investor shares for UK government bonds. So who are the lucky shareholders in the running for those gilts? Here's a quick look at the top 10 shareholders in BT: Deutsche Telekom 12.1% BlackRock 5.73% Vanguard 2.73% Orange 2.69% Columbia Threadneedle Investments 2.38% Legal &amp; General Investment Management 1.81% Norges Bank Investment Management 1.68% Invesco Asset Management 1.63% M&amp;G Investment Management 1.33% Schroder Investment Management 1% Labour has said web companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, would foot the bill for the nationalised British broadband company's annual maintenance costs. The party estimates those operating costs are about \u00a3230m a year. McDonnell told Sky News: These companies now have to pay their fair share...no more sweetheart deals. My colleague Rowena Mason has further details here: Investors are considering which other UK firms could be candidates for nationalisation. Some of the names being bandied around include Royal Mail (privatised fully by 2015) and Royal Bank of Scotland (which is still 62% owned by the government following its bailout in 2008). Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says: BT expressed surprise at last night's announcement having been assured by Labour fairly recently that they weren't being considered as a nationalisation candidate. With other companies also being told the same thing by the Labour Party, investors will no doubt be looking very carefully at other possible candidates for nationalisation, and whether they need to be concerned. Companies like Royal Bank of Scotland, National Grid, Centrica, Severn Trent, Royal Mail as well as the rail company franchisees, like Go Ahead Group and National Express to name but a few, are already trading at a nationalisation discount. For now, given Labour's current polling numbers the concern is fairly minimal, and investors will be hoping it stays that way, which helps explain the fairly muted share price reaction. BT rival TalkTalk is holding off on a decision to sell its own infrastructure arm to see how this whole Labour plan pans out. TalkTalk chief executive Tristia Harrison told Reuters: Our discussions are very advanced, and yes, the news overnight of course is making everybody in the sector pause and consider. We were really close, really close, but I think something of this sort that is in the news, obviously everybody is pausing, considering, digesting and working out what it means. Sky News, which first reported the strategic delay, said CityFibre Holdings nearly signed a deal to acquire TalkTalk's FibreNation on Thursday before Labour's pledge was announced. More comments from Labour's shadow chancellor, who is now speaking to Sky News. He says the Labour pledge to establish a company called British Broadband from nationalising BT's Openreach, follows similar models in countries like South Korea. John McDonnell confirms that the nationalisation will be done by swapping investors' BT shares for UK government bonds. He adds that parliament will determine the value and ensure it is \"done with a proper price\" and that government bonds will offer shareholders a\"stable, long-term investment.\" That's exactly what pension funds and other shareholders are saying they need at the moment. It will be a good deal. We can't afford not to do it...we've fallen behind global competitors. He adds: I've been touring around the country and you know even in some of our city areas they're not connected up...this is good for the economy. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, McDonnell has been clarifying Labour's proposals, including that the part nationalisation would only apply to BT's broadband network operator Openreach. My colleague Lisa O'Carroll has some of the details: The reaction trickling out from analysts hasn't been glowing so far. There are concerns that ongoing efforts by the government and sector regulator Ofcom to incentivise fibre installation by rival operators could all be for naught. Matthew Howett, Founder &amp; Principal Analyst at Assembly comments: This is a spectacularly bad take by the Labour Party. The almost cut throat competition between broadband rivals has meant faster speeds, improved coverage and lower prices for consumers up and down the country.

Companies such as Virgin, CityFibre and others have committed billions to rival Openreach. Those plans risk being shelved overnight. Only one other country in the world to come close to going down this route, and for a good reason - it's hard, expensive and fraught with difficulty. Australia's NBN is years late, massively over budget and offering speeds and technology a fraction of the original political intention. BT shares have slipped at the UK market open, dropping more than 2% It makes the telecoms firm one of biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 alongside Berkeley group down 1.7%. Fresnillo down 1.6% and Standard Chartered down 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Overnight, UK businesses have been digesting Labour's latest election pledge that would result in the part-nationalisation of telecoms giant BT. It is part of a plan to bring free full-fibre broadband to every home and business across the UK - but there's clearly a question on costs. The Labour party said the estimated capital cost of rolling out full-fibre broadband was \u00a315bn, on top of the government's existing \u00a35bn earmarked for broadband expansion. This would be funded from its green transformation fund - paid for by borrowing. But BT boss Philip Jansen has now weighed in and said the scheme would cost up to \u00a3100bn. Speaking to the BBC, Jansen said: These are very, very ambitious ideas and the Conservative Party have their own ambitious idea for full fibre for everyone by 2025 and how we do it is not straight forward. It needs funding, it is very big numbers, so we are talking 30 to 40 billion pounds.. and if you are giving it away over an eight year time frame it is a another 30 or 40 billion pounds. You are not short of 100 billion pounds. We'll continue to bring you the latest business reaction as we get it. Also coming up...

What does it mean for you?</p><p>In terms of the technical set-up, it won't change very much. You'll still need the \"landline\" for your internet connection. Your voice calls will simply start running over the internet instead of using the old telephone signal.</p><p>\"Death of the landline is a bit of a myth\", Richard Knowles from BT told Mirror Tech.</p><p>\"What we call the landline is, in fact, your internet connection. It's not being changed or taken away from anyone,\" he said.</p><p>\"We can run it down the same infrastructure - but in a different way. It means that Mirror readers shouldn't notice any difference in the quality.\"</p><p>Potentially, the infrastructure saving on BT's end could be passed on to customers but it seems unlikely.</p><p>\"There are services out there on the market where you don't get a landline, you get internet only. It's not massively cheaper, it's just the way it's being delivered is different,\" Mr Knowles said.</p><p>Any changes the company is making won't happen immediately, instead it will take at least until 2025 for BT to migrate its system over to broadband. It just needs the regulation lifted to make it easier to tackle its international rivals.</p><p>\"Our goal is that by 2025 all our voice customers will be served using an IP to the premises solution, and will migrate off the traditional telephony platform,\" said BT's CEO Gavin Patterson.</p><p>\"In terms of network architecture, we're building a seamless, converged single platform that's able to serve customers wherever they are. There's no distinction between fixed and mobile, one common access platform is able to deliver both.\"  What do other companies use?</p><p>Most of the big tech companies (Google, Apple, Microsoft) use an \"over-the-top\" service to deliver voice calls on the internet. There's no requirement other than bandwidth and data allowance or wi-fi. And no regulations they have to adhere to.</p><p>\"Regulation has not kept up with the massive growth in competition and rapid pace of technology change over the last decade,\" BT said in its statement. What does Ofcom say?</p><p>For its part, Ofcom is planning a review of the telecoms market next month. It analyses the state of the industry once every decade to determine trends and changes.</p><p>According to the Telegraph, a formal paper will be published in mid-July to kick off the review but won't explicitly state the regulators' plans.</p><p>All we have is an indication from Sharon White, the chief executive of Ofcom that it might employ a lighter approach to the telecoms companies going forward.</p><p>Do YOU still use a landline?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIRONL-21140912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIRONL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G9C-9YN1-JCJY-G1MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419001</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><timeReceived>4:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Trinity Mirror, Plc.

Please see important disclosure following this article. A Blast from a Bubble Past.Being old\u2014like north of 60\u2014doesn't come with many advantages. However, in the investment game it does have at least one: being 'mature' enough to remember past financial and business cycles. In the case of this geezer, I have recently been having repeated flashbacks of the fateful year of our Lord, 2000. Accordingly, in this month's latest installment of 'Bubble 3.0' I'm harking back to Bubble 1.0, the infamous tech boom that ended in one of the most punishing value destructions of all-time. One could even credibly assert, as I have in the past, that it was the long-ago tech bubble of the late 1990s that set off the chain of events which led to Bubble 2.0 and, if I'm right, our present bout of rank speculation. For many years, there weren't a lot of similarities between the first and third manias but at least since 2017 that's been changing. As Mark Twain supposedly quipped, history doesn't repeat but it does rhyme and there seems be a lot of rhyming going on these days. One of the reasons I've heard in the past as to why what we are going through now isn't another bubble in US stocks was because the IPO* market has been subdued. For many years, that was true even though US stocks, as measured by the price-to-sales ratio, one of the best market valuation tools, had equaled or even exceeded the dizzying heights seen in late 1999 and early 2000. This metric is especially worrisome on a median (i.e., the mid-point of the S...00) price-to-revenue basis. *IPO stands for Initial Public Offerings, or new issues. S...00 Price/Sales Ratio  S...00 Median Price/Sales Ratio  Source: Ned Davis Research, May 22, 2019 It may have been a fair point that you can't have an old-fashioned bubble without an IPO feeding frenzy. Wall Street has always excelled at creating the fuel\u2014not to mention the hype\u2014that stokes these strange episodes where greed fully obscures the reality that most new issues end up being losers. Lately, one has to be in full bubble denial not to recognize the mania that has once again engulfed the market for new issues. Three recent offerings underscore the 2000 echo feature of this latest infatuation with IPOs. While there are some other worthy candidates, Uber, Lyft and Beyond Meat deserve special mention. For one thing, all three are totally unacquainted with that dated concept of making money. For those, like me, who are chronologically-advanced enough to remember the late '90s, that was also an era when profits were an after-thought. The 1999/early 2000 class of going-public companies were able to command what were then lofty valuations by touting metrics like 'number of eyeballs' or 'total addressable market'. Profit considerations were ignored. It was all about attracting as many users and/or spinning fantastical tales about the sheer size of the potential revenue pool. Well, here we go again. Over 80% of IPOs coming to market currently are earnings-free, the highest since\u2014you guessed it\u20142000. In actuality, most are losing copious amounts of money, as was also the case nearly 20 years ago. However, one big difference is literally that\u2014today's crop of new offerings are much bigger than during Bubble 1.0, and so are their operating losses. Uber, for example, was losing a cool billion per quarter before it went public. If nothing else, you've got to give it credit for consistency because it's maintained that pace since its May 9th public offering and its own projections showing that continuing. Like its fellow recently-listed ride-hailing service, Lyft, Uber has also been losing money in a new and different way. Right out of the gate, it plunged 18%, generating about $14 billion in lost market value for its shareholders, before rallying back with the overall market to only about a 6%, or $5 billion, loss. Actually, Uber was generating valuation erosion even before it went public at a market capitalization of $80 billion; that was a mere $40 billion below where it was supposedly to be valued\u2014at least until Lyft did a reverse-lift almost as soon as it started trading. At one point, Uber's rival was down 33% for an overall market value shrinkage of $8 billion. Between the two, they have produced $8.5 billion in losses since making their public debuts. For those rare market professionals who were actually in the game back in 2000, this is another retro event. That great equity bubble\u2014arguably one that even exceeded the legendary 1920s stock market insanity\u2014began its equally great deflation when several high-profile IPOs bombed. But that's not to say that all IPOs are crumbling right now. The third highlighted new issue\u2014Beyond Meats, ticker BYND\u2014is indicative that speculative juices are still flowing freely these days. Initially priced at $25 per share, Beyond Meat's brief trading history indicates that its underwriters may have priced it a tad too conservatively. On Monday of this week, it briefly hit almost $168, for an aggregate market capitalization of roughly $10 billion, before falling over $40 the next day. Now, an $8 to $10 billion valuation isn't eye-popping for a new company these days, especially compared to Uber's $75 billion market cap. But an investor would be forgiven if his or her eyes watered a bit considering that Beyond Meat produced all of $88 million in sales last year. What about profits you might dare to ask? Well, it's beyond me why anyone would be such a stickler for earnings when a company can convert the humble pea into something as tasty as a juicy, albeit faux, hamburger. (Caveat BYND emptor: At the risk of being considered of the stickler type, my wife and I were intrigued by the idea of a tasty and healthy alternative to meat. Thus, we dutifully headed to Bristol Farms to buy a package of both their sausages and meat patties. The first thing that jumped out at us was how high-fat they were, especially the burgers. Now, maybe it's 'good' fat, like avocados, but still 20 grams is another eye-opener. As far as the taste goes, the sausages were decent but the patties were a different story. Maybe I over-grilled them but even our dogs wouldn't eat them and they've never been nitpickers when it comes to anything vaguely resembling meat. In fact, one of them recently consumed a tennis ball whole, leading to a $7000 emergency surgery bill. Thank God for pet insurance!) Less well known than the above IPO trio are issues such as Coupa Software, now trading at a P/E of 642 (don't look for missing decimal; there isn't one), Zoom Video (P/E 1000, short-hand for infinite), Blackline (it must have a touch of black on its bottom-line given a P/E of 395), the Trade Desk (a screaming bargain at 70 times earnings) and Zscaler (at a much less bargain P/E of 686). Of course, these must all be based on trailing earnings\u2014or losses. No doubt, based on future profits, like out somewhere around 2030, this collection of exceptional growth stocks must actually be reasonably valued. Ok, even a rabid bull might concede, conditions in the IPO market are somewhat overheated. But what about those that have longer trading histories, in some cases pre-dating the original tech boom-cum-bust? One of that old guard is Adobe, a fabulous service most of us use, knowingly or not. Unsurprisingly, it trades at just 14 times. The problem is that it is timessales, not earnings. Its P/E is a rather generous 50, which is particularly notable based on a market value of $135 billion due to the fact it's exceedingly hard for a company that large to grow fast enough to justify either 14 times sales or 50 times earnings. On that point, Scott McNealy, former CEO of one of the biggest supernovas of Bubble 1.0, Sun Microsystems, was famously quoted as saying, in the wake of the tech implosion, that it was nonsensical to pay anything like 10 times sales for a large company. This is a partial excerpt of his scathing comments from 2002: 'At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividendsWhat were you thinking?' Today, clearly, investors are obviously oblivious to such warnings. The list of companies at 10 times sales or more is a long one. In addition to Adobe, there is Salesforce.com (CRM, 10 times), Cyberark Software (CYBR, 14 times), HubSpot (Hubs, 14 times), MongoDB (MDB, 29 times sales!). In the interest of saving time and space, I'll show just the following ticker symbols (you can look up if you care): NEWR (13 times sales), NOW (17X), PAYC (21X), TEAM (23X) TWLO (26X). VEEV (24X) and WDAY (16X). (Thanks to the ultimate bubble-buster, Fred Hickey, for these factoids.) One major divergence vs 2000 is that these outrageous valuations go well beyond tech. For example, Wingstop (WING) a purveyor, as its name implies, of chicken wings and other animal appendages, trades at a high-flying P/E of 90 and 14 times sales. Planet Fitness (PLNT), the gym operator, sells at a weighty 50 times earnings and 11 times sales. ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG) is another restaurant chain selling at a tech-like P/E of 56. Frankly, I've never seen so many companies, even in 2000, trading at prices that are in, most cases, nearly certain to produce return-free risk. But there is some very good news, in my opinion, for disciplined and discerning investors. It's a message that was conveyed in our January 3rd special buy-alert EVA, in which we expressed our belief a powerful rally was looming. In my view, it bears repeating, including to the perma-bears: This is a two-tier market. Just as was the case in 2000, there are a multitude of reasonably valued companies. In some cases, these entities are so detested that they are trading truly at give-away prices. As usual, and as was also true in early 2000, energy is the poster-child for the malign neglect. Rarely has the energy sector represented just 5% of the S...00's market value. You can see below that this is one of those times. Only during the nuttiest days of Bubble 1.0 did energy trade even cheaper on a relative value. Energy Sector as a % of the S...00  Source: Ned Davis Research (data from 6/5/2019 edition of Ned's Insights) Additionally, several of the bluest chip energy names yield 5% to 6% with extremely well-covered dividends. The prevailing justification for this cheapness is that we now live in an increasingly digital world and that energy is becoming obsolete. This is almost a (hydro) carbon copy of the mindset that prevailed back in early 2000 when the energy sector was viewed as the ultimate embodiment of 'old economy'. Not long after the tech crash, however, the realization was that all those server farms being built\u2014even back then\u2014by Microsoft and others were huge consumers of energy. From the end of the first quarter of 2000 until the fourth quarter of 2007, in the dying days of Bubble 2.0 (housing), energy produced a total return of 228% vs minus 54% for the tech sector. Another epiphany may be close at hand. Our partner firm Gavekal recently held its annual retreat in Hong Kong. Analysts and strategists from all over the world convened to discuss their strongest convictions and views. One of the dominant themes to emerge from their conclave was that markets are underappreciating, once again, how much power the digital world consumes. Per leading tech consultant Gartner, the number of connected devices is set to double in the near future, leading global internet traffic to triple over the next five years. According to Charles Gave: 'If the Internet-Big Data complex were a country it would already be the third largest electricity consumer in the world, after the US and China.' With the crypto currencies like Bitcoin coming back from the dead, you may recall that mining for them is highly energy-intensive. It's estimated that the current global production of the cryptos amounts to the equivalent power usage of over six million US homes. Renewables will undoubtedly be the fastest growing source of energy to power the explosive growth of all things digital, a trend that is likely to become even more viral as the 'internet of things' hits stride over the next few years. However, the reality is that fossil fuels, along with nuclear, will provide the primary baseload for the planet's energy needs for years, if not decades, to come. Speaking of cryptos, which are enjoying a robust bounce, this is a further commonality with the 2000 dot.com blow-off then blow-up. The chart of Bitcoin overlaid on the NASDAQ circa the late 1990s is remarkably similar. However, as with everything involving Bitcoin, it has happened in accelerated time.  Source: Bloomberg, Evergreen Gavekal As previousEVAs have observed, Bitcoin is likely the signature micro-bubble within this latest overall bubble, just as the NASDAQ was THE epicenter of the late '90s equity craze. For sure, this time the Bitcoin bubble has had to compete with many others for that title. This is due to the fact interest rates have been largely exterminated globally, causing a mad rush into higher-risk assets and the better returns they are hoped to deliver. Just as the 'NAZ' was dead money for over a decade after it crashed, the same is likely to be true of Bitcoin and the other cryptos, despite what will almost certainly be some dramatic bear market rallies. Yet an additional parallel with 2000 is the regulatory attack on tech. In the late '90s, it was pretty much only Microsoft that was big enough to attract the government's scrutiny and ire. The anti-trust case against MSFT started in 1998 and opening arguments began in 2001. But between its share price being grossly inflated plus the fines and restrictions placed on it, the damage was done. As a result of the various handcuffs it was forced to wear, as well as missing some critical new product trends, our local software giant lagged the S...00 by 64% from 12/31/99 through 12/31/12, falling 40% vs the market's 24% rise. Ironically, today, the company Bill Gates built is no longer in the US government's crosshairs. But, as Michael Johnston highlighted inlast week'sEVA[4], Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google definitely are. Because these four represent about 12% of the S... total value, anything that causes a repeat of what Microsoft experienced two decades ago is a big threat to the index\u2014and all those who blindly mimic it. (Note, Evergreen owns two of the above issues for many clients but at less than a market weighting.) Fortunately, three of the four trade at reasonable P/Es, unlike so many of their smaller competitors. Yet, should government interference cause flat or, God forbid, falling earnings, they may still struggle for a time. Next up on the echoes of 2000: The war then vs the war now. In fairness, the war on terror didn't begin until September of 2001 when the tech bust was well underway. However, it certainly intensified the carnage. Today's war is, mercifully, not of the shooting variety but it is nonetheless most dangerous, particularly for big tech. This is because few industries have benefited more from sourcing their products in low-cost countries like China and selling everywhere, including, of course, to China itself. Consequently, tech is at risk of losing both its access to inexpensive production and one of its most lucrative end-markets, as are many US multi-national companies. As Michael also noted last week, tech earnings have been vitally important to the US market. In fact, they have debatably been one of the two main reasons why US stocks have dramatically outperformed global equity markets over the past decade, along with buybacks. Thus, anything that threatens tech's exceptional earnings record is of profound consequence to the overall US market. The enormous and consistently rising earnings from the titans of tech\u2014which politicians like Bernie Sanders and others allege are due to monopolistic characteristics\u2014has been one of primary forces behind the higher highs seen by S...00 profit margins over the last twenty years. (Another factor was the persistent drop, until lately, in labor costs but that tailwind is turning into a headwind.) This profitability surge has also been a prime driver behind the US market's exceptional outperformance of overseas indexes. This is, in turn, one of the key reasons the price-to-sales ratio has risen back to near the peak seen in 2000 (or beyond on a median basis), per the first chart in thisEVA.   Source: Down Under Daily, April 4, 2019 On the buyback topic, the May 17thEVApointed out the extraordinary 'coincidence' of the Fed creating $4 trillion of fake money, corporate America taking on $4 trillion of new debt and the $4 trillion of buy-backs that have occurred. This has also been another unique aspect of our country versus the rest of the world. You may not be aware, and I wasn't until recently, of one of the probable causes of this stock buy-back binge. In 1995, just as Bubble 1.0 was ready to gargantuanly inflate, then President Bill Clinton signed a bill making executive compensation over $1 million non-deductible for tax purposes. But here's the key part: incentive compensation, like stock options, was exempted. Thus was ushered in an era of massive stock and option awards, leading to lavish pay packages the likes of which had never been seen before and which have only gotten more egregious since. Understandably, this also caused stock buy-backs--which generally increase earnings per share and, in turn, share prices\u2014to look irresistible in the eyes of senior corporate executives. Once the Fed reduced interest rates to negligible levels, it made it equally irresistible to borrow trillions to push this process into hyper-drive. (As previously written, this is such a crucial theme it deserves its own 'Bubble 3.0' chapter, to be keyboarded in the not too distant future.) But there are threats to this bull market aphrodisiac with politicians as diverse as Elizabeth Warren and Marco Rubio assailing the diversion of such large sums away from efficiency-enhancing investments. They believe, as does this author, that multi-trillion dollar stock buy-backs have been one of the prime causes of the long-running erosion in corporate America's productivity. Similarly, during Bubble 1.0, Warren Buffett was railing against the exclusion of stock option costs in earnings calculations. As he said at the time, 'If options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it?' It will be very, very surprising if there isn't a vicious political backlash against the games that CEOs and CFOs have played to enrich themselves and their shareholders during this cycle. The latter will likely find out that in many cases the inflated share prices were temporary. By that point, though, most of the senior executive stock options will have long been exercised and sold. The last flashback aspect I'm going to bring up\u2014though there are many more I could\u2014relates to the yield curve and current economic conditions. As most EVA readers are aware (I hope!), this refers to the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. The former are normally lower than the latter. Presently, as happened in 2000, the yield curve is definitely not normal. Portions of the treasury yield curve inverted last year and it has become even more so recently. When it inverted early in 2000, it stayed that way for the full year even as stocks and the economy started to lose altitude, a situation we are seeing once again. The culprit, as usual, is the economy. For at least six months, we've been making the case that business conditions were softening. This has been in contradiction to most of the mainstream media's sunny view of the US economy. We've even read recently about the 'robust global economy' despite the fact that overseas economies have been sucking wind for over a year.As you can see below, theOECD (i.e., developed country) Composite Leading Indicators,one of the critical measures of the planet's economic health,is in a steep decline. In the US, thekey Manufacturing PMIjust hit its lowest level sinceSeptember,2009, when the Great Recession was still raging. OECD (DEVELOPED ECONOMIES) COMPOSITE LEADING INDICATOR, 1962-2019  Source: John Kemp, June 12, 2019  Source: Ned Davis Research, June 3, 2019 There is a plethora of factoids I could relay on the US slowdown but that would take up an entireEVAso here's just a brief recap of some of salient items, courtesy of David Rosenberg, for my money North America's best economist (all figures are year-over-year): Railway carloadings: -5.8%  Factory shipments of air-conditioners and heat pumps: -1.8%  Lumber production: -1.2%  Electrical utility output: -6.9%  Car sales: -7.9%  Major home appliances: -16.7%  Semiconductor billings: -29%  Perhaps all of the above, and much more, is why the NY Fed's recession risk model continues to soar. As you can see, once it hits the upper 30s, a recession becomes highly probable.  Source: Bloomberg, Evergreen Gavekal (data as of 5/31/2019) What many have long viewed as proof-positive that the US economy was just fine has been the jobs market\u2014note the words 'has been'. As you may have read, the employment report for May released last week was shockingly bad. Many are dismissing this as an aberration but, as we've been repeatedly warning for months, the jobs market's leading indicators, such as overtime pay and temporary employment, have been steadily eroding. Even before last Friday's stunner, regular readers ofThe Economistshould not have been surprised by the adverse jobs number based on that magazine's well-known curse of its cover stories. This was the front page of its May 25th issue:  Going back in time once more to early 2000, it was nearly inconceivable then that a recession would begin a year later. America was experiencing a legitimate economic boom with growth far faster than it has been throughout our current expansion. Consumer confidence was at all-time highs with nary a cloud in the economic skies.  Source: Gluskin Sheff Research, May 29, 2019 Moreover, it was not debt-driven pseudo-prosperity. The Federal government was actually running a surplus. By contrast, per the King of Bonds, Jeff Gundlach, the US government has been running deficits in excess of 7.7% annually to produce just 3.4% nominal growth in GDP over the past 13 years. (Nominal GDP includes inflation and therefore is not the 'real' GDP usually reported; that number has been about 2% per year during this expansion). Yet, despite how exceedingly vigorous the US economy was in early 2000, the next recession started in the spring of 2001. Note this was six months prior to the horrific 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. Besides the debt-driven aspect of today's global economy, another glaring dissimilarity has to do with interest rates. An investor who was leery of the stock market in those days could shift into high grade bonds or CDs yielding 6% to 8%. (Weren't those the days?!!). Now, with the best rate on CDs in the mid-2s and most high-grade corporate bond yields sub-4%, investors in financial assets feel forced to stay more heavily exposed to stocks than their age might dictate. And if they want to make money in a market that has basically gone nowhere for almost a year and a half, since late January of 2018, they may feel compelled to chase the crazy overpriced momentum names mentioned above. This is where studying 2000 could really save the day. By March of that year, there was a giant valuation chasm between the shrinking number of popular stocks and those that had been out of favor for at least two years. Investors who shifted from growth issues into value shares were spared the first two years of the looming three-year bear market and the terrible toll that so many suffered by being heavily exposed to the NASDAQ as it vaporized by nearly 80%. As you can readily see from the chart below, it's definitely a case of deja vu all over again.   Source: J.P. Morgan, June 7, 2019 Even though this is heresy to many, the Evergreen view is that a simple buy-and-hold approach with an S...00 index fund won't cut it; actually it hasn't for a while, like the last almost 20 years. Of course, two decades isn't really that longat least in cosmic terms. As mentioned numerous times in these pages, the S...as only returned 5.6% per year since 12/31/99, slightly less than you could have realized on a diverse portfolio of investment grade corporate bonds over that timeframe, and, of course, with far greater risk. Just as in 2000, allocating away from the most bubble-infested parts of today's stock market is essential, as is selling into rallies and buying into weakness. There was definitely buyable weakness late last year and it looked like we might see another opportunity had the May dip continued. However, the Fed's hints that it might start cutting rates this summer catalyzed a new snappy rally. The market seems convinced that an easing Fed is unquestionably bullish but question that belief I must do, once more going back to Bubble 1.0. As 2000 drew to a wobbly close both for stocks and the economy, the Fed opted to cut rates by a dramatic % in early January of 2001. The beleaguered NASDAQ surged 14% IN ONE DAY. Now, that's a bear market rally! The problem is that it continued to decline after that, by almost 60%. The same thing happened in 2007 and 2008, as the Fed frantically cut rates reacting to the housing bubble and economic meltdown it never saw coming, to no avail. Consequently, perhaps the vaunted 'Fed put'\u2014essentially, dramatic easing to avoid market mayhem\u2014doesn't work once a full-blown bubble has developed.  Please allow me to end this latest installment of Bubble 3.0 with this image, also from Fred Hickey, and the question it asks: Is an Accommodative Fed Bullish for the Stock Market? Put on your robe and grab your gavel\u2014you be the judge.

VB is hosting our 5th annual Mobile Summit[1] on February 23-24 at the scenic Cavallo Point Resort in Sausalito, CA. See if you qualify here.[2] Gaurav Jain[3] is a Principal at Founder Collective[4], an early stage VC firm based in Cambridge and NYC that has made investments in 150 companies including Uber, Buzzfeed, and Makerbot. </p><p>He cofounded Polar[5] and was an early Product Manager for Android. Follow him @gjain.[6] As a VC, the number one question I get, repeatedly, is if we're in a bubble. The answer is simple. No. At least not like the one that peaked back on March 10, 2000 when the NASDAQ hit 5,132.52 in intraday trading, before cratering a couple years later at 1114.11. (As of this writing, it sits at 4,744.84). You might ask why I possess this irrational exuberance, or at least unwillingness to be pessimistic. Over the last 15 years, we've seen 10X growth in the number of people using the Internet, a 17X growth in the rate of online consumer spending in the U.S., not to mention nearly 40 percent inflation[7] of the dollar. Despite those, and many other positive signs, we are still 4 percent below the dot-com bubble peak in the value of the NASDAQ composite. The NASDAQ might drop precipitously, and there are plenty of reasons to believe that the exorbitant valuations startups are receiving will shrink. But this persistent fear of bubbles has more to do with our human tendency to stick with familiar narratives, especially as it relates to technology, rather than an evaluation of market fundamentals. Beware familiar but faulty logic Remember when Android was going to destroy iOS? The theory was that eventually, the sheer number of installed smartphones would make the economics of Android irresistible for developers. Apple would be consigned to the role of 'also-ran' just like it was when it competed with Microsoft in the PC industry. Instead, Samsung, the leading Android handset manufacturer, is hemorrhaging[8] share, and app developers make 70 percent more revenue[9] from the App Store than the Android equivalent. Remember when pundits argued that Apple had to reduce the cost of its phones? Again, the PC industry 'proved' that eventually prices will collapse, leaving Apple out-of-step with consumer demands. On January 26, 2015, Apple announced the greatest quarterly financial results in history[10] and an average selling price that increased[11] dramatically. So it goes with startup valuations. It seems that every time a company with a young founder, bold idea, and billion dollar valuation comes onto the scene, pundits invoke the 2000 tech bubble (usually with a snide joke about Pets.com). Some will point to the fact that the amount of money VCs raised in 2014 ($32.9 billion[12]) is up 60 percent from the prior year, but it's actually lower than the record $85 billion[13] raised in 2000, or even the more modest funds raised from 2005-2007, especially when factoring in inflation. There's no doubt that the funding environment is frothy, valuations for many companies are rich, and that some of today's biggest name startups will face challenges (e.g. Fab[14]), but the world has changed dramatically in the last decade and a half: Here are 15 key differences between 2000 and 2015: <url normalizedValue=\"http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Not-a-Bubble.jpgWhen\">http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Not-a-Bubble.jpgWhen</url> was the last time you ate dinner without a Pavlovian impulse to check your phone? In the year 2000, the Internet was largely a novelty. Today it's central to our existence. Toddlers navigate YouTube, commuters bury their faces in phones while on the subway. 44 percent of smartphone users[15] sleep with their phones, and two thirds of smartphone owners take their surfing to the bathroom[16]. The valuations of tech companies might drop, but they won't evaporate as they did when AOL chatrooms were the web's primary draw. In 2000, web business models were immature, but in 2015 they power retail. In 2015, the e-commerce industry will grow to over $350 billion[17] from $28 billion[18] 15 years ago. In 2014, 40 percent of holiday dollars[19] were spent online. $2.7 trillion[20] will be exchanged globally online in 2015. E-commerce is a force to be reckoned with, and the industry has grown to a size that can easily accommodate many billion dollar companies. Advertisers have taken note of this shift and spent $121 billion[21] to target these customers, accounting for 23 percent of the global ad spend. Critics will point out that Amazon, the e-commerce leader, isn't consistently profitable, but as Benedict Evans notes[22], a company can only be unprofitable for 20 years by choice. This trend is only getting started. Despite its massive growth, e-commerce only accounts for 6.6 percent of U.S. retail spending[23]. Even the giant Amazon only accounts for 1 percent of total retail sales. Today, 10 percent of cars are currently connected to the Internet, but that number is predicted to rise to 90 percent by 2020[24]. And think, health care, education, and government are three massive markets that have not yet embraced technology to the level that media and retail have. The Case for a Soft Landing Let's imagine that the worst case scenario hits and the stock market plummets by 20 percent or more. Here are some reasons things won't be as bad as in 2000. Cost to experiment and fail has dropped by several orders of magnitude: We know a lot more quickly now whether a business will work. In 2014, Kickstarter allowed tech and game entrepreneurs to raise $310 million dollars[25] in non-dilutive funding directly from customers. The app Yo[26], a single person effort, signed up over a million users[27] across the globe in weeks. And unlike 2000, these massive rounds of financing are typically directed towards companies who are showing meaningful progress, rather than the land grab style of investing that marked the first bubble. Understanding tech companies is more of a science: One of the big reason the original bubble popped so dramatically, causing the NASDAQ to lose approximately 70 percent of its value, was because our methods of evaluating tech stocks were so crude. 'Eyeballs' became a crude proxy for revenue. In the last 15 years, our understanding of a company's LTV, CAC, and other key performance metrics has improved significantly. As a result, today's pillar tech companies look much more like old-line blue chippers than the Y2K-era flameouts. Google has a P/E ratio of ~27[28], Apple is at ~17[29]. There is growth baked into these numbers, but it's not irrational exuberance. Increased late stage funding = longer time to IPO = less opportunity for retail investors to get burned: In 2000, 406 companies went public[30]. In 2014, only 167 tech companies debuted in the public markets. The Sarbanes-Oxley regulations have helped shield retail investors from the wild swings that come with tech investing. (It's also prevented them from participating in the upside, but that's a story for a different post.) If a correction comes, it will hit VCs hard, but middle American brokerages will be spared the worst of the losses, essentially a reverse of the 2000 bubble. This is still bad; it will cause many VCs to seize, and will create ripples across the tech economy, but we won't see stories of grandmothers forced into poverty because they bet their nest egg on a specious tech stock. Big tech companies have amassed a lot of cash: Apple has $178 billion[31] of cash on its balance sheet \u2014 more than the market cap of 483 of the 500 S...00 companies. Microsoft has $90 billion of cash on hand. Google has $60 billion. A lot of this money is used in infrastructure investments, like Google Fiber and data centers, which in turn increases the market for tech products. M...ctivity, like Nest, Siri, and Yammer create new product categories that in turn create new opportunities for startups. Let's say something forces the market to plummet, the IPO window shuts, and VCs put away their checkbooks. Big tech companies will essentially be able to buy up a wide variety of assets, or the teams behind them, on the cheap. Unlike 2000, successful tech companies will be able to salvage some value from the assets that these less successful companies built and prevent a disaster like we saw in 2001. If public and private financial markets fail to fairly value startups, cash rich tech companies will create a floor for their value. For more insights from tech industry insiders, explore\u00a0VentureBeat's selection of recent guest posts[32]. Winter IS Coming The market has been on a run since 2010 and according to the theory of random walks the probability is that we'll face some leaner years ahead. Even if it's not a 'bubble' the tech industry is even more sensitive to changes in the macro environment than the broader market. The global financial crisis in 2008 had nothing to do with tech, but it impacted startups in painful ways (remember RIP Good Times[33]?). When lean years hit, it's going to be challenging for everyone involved in tech. Entrepreneurs who have graced magazine covers will have to lay off hundreds of talented workers. Hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital will be lost. Progress will slow. But it will be temporary. There has never been a better time to be starting and building a tech company. There is so much growth still ahead of us. More than four billion people are waiting to be connected to the Internet and even mature areas, like e-commerce, are still only in the single digits of penetration. There will be bumps, but don't expect another bubble pop. Like this story? Want to learn more? On February 23-24, our fifth annual VentureBeat Mobile Summit[34] will tackle 6 big opportunities for business to leverage mobile to grow. The invitation-only Summit will gather the top 180 executives at the scenic Cavallo Point Resort in Sausalito, Calif., to discuss issues like this.

Via Ammo.com,[3]  'In America we say if anyone gets hurt, we will ban it for everyone everywhere for all time. And before we know it, everything is banned.'  - Professor Jonathan Haidt[4]  It's a common refrain: We have bubble-wrapped the world. Americans in particular are obsessed with 'safety.' </p><p>The simplest way to get any law passed in America, be it a zoning law or a sweeping reform of the intelligence community, is to invoke a simple sentence: 'A kid might get hurt.'    Almost no one is opposed to reasonable efforts at making the world a safer place. But the operating word here is 'reasonable.' Banninglawn darts[5], for example, rather than just telling people that they can be dangerous when used by unsupervised children, is a perfect example of a craving for safety gone too far.  Beyond the realm of legislation, this has begun to infect our very culture. Think of things like'trigger warnings'[6]and'safe spaces.'[7]These are part of broader cultural trends in search of a kind of 'emotional safety' - a purported right to never be disturbed or offended by anything. This is by no means confined to the sphere of academia, but is also in our popular culture, both in 'extremely online[8]' and more mainstream variants.  Why are Americans so obsessed with safety? What is the endgame of those who would bubble wrap the world, both physically and emotionally? Perhaps most importantly, what can we do to turn back the tide and reclaim our culture ofself-reliance[9],mental toughness[10], and giving one another the benefit of the doubt so that we don't 'bankrupt ourselves in the vain search for absolute security,' as President Dwight D. Eisenhowerwarned us about[11]?  Coddling and Splintering: The Transformation of the American Mind  Two books published in 2018 provide parallel insights into the problems presented by the safety obsession of American culture:The Splintering of the American Mindby William Egginton[12], focused on the tendency of Americans to tunnel themselves off into self-selected bubbles, andThe Coddling of the American Mindby Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt[13], which deals more with the tendency to avoid any uncomfortable or unpleasant information.    There is an interesting phenomenon involved in coddling: Australian psychologist Nick Haskam first coined the term 'concept creep.' Basically, this means that terms are often elastic and expand past the point of meaning. Take, for example, the concept of'trauma.'[14]This used to have a very limited meaning. However, 'trauma' quickly became expanded to mean even slight physical or emotional harm or discomfort. Thus the increasing belief among the far left that words can be 'violence' - not 'violent,' mind you, but actual, literal violence.  In the other direction,the definition of 'hero' has been expanded[15]to mean just about anything. Every teacher, firefighter and police officer is now considered a 'hero.' This isn't to downplay or minimize the importance of these roles in our society. It's simply to point out that 'hero' just doesn't mean what it used to 100 or even 30 years ago.  Once this expansion of a term occurs, there is never any kind of retraction. Trauma now means just about anything, and violence will soon be expanded to include lawful, peaceful speech that one disapproves of. Once this happens, there will be no going back.In the words of Sam Harris[16]:  'We (as a society) have to be committed to defending free speech however impolitic, or unpopular, or even wrong because defending that is the only barrier to violence. That's because the only way we can influence one another short of physical violence is through speech, through communicating ideas. The moment you say certain ideas can't be communicated you create a circumstance where people have no alternative but to go hands on you.'  It is extremely dangerous to begin labelling everything as violence for reasons of free speech, but perhaps even more dangerous is the notion that when anything is violence, nothing is violence. Redefining words as 'violence' means that we have little recourse for when actual violence occurs.  The Coddling of the American Mindnotes some other concepts that are important as we speak of America's obsession with 'safety' above all else. First, that coddling combined with splintering means that people's political views are much more like fanatical religious views than anything. They don't see themselves as having to debate ideas or seek common ground. Rather, the opposing side and its proponents are seen as 'dangerous' and must be discredited at all costs. It is worth noting that this is much more common among the left than the right or the center, which has now become more the place where 'live and let live' types congregate.  The problem with this goes beyond simply being irritated by irrational people barking at you or at someone else: There is an entire generation of people who are seriously lacking incritical thinking skills[17]. They think that labelling people and name-calling are excuses for a reasoned argument. In the words of Voltaire, 'Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.'  These problems are hardly confined to political radicalism or academia. Indeed, the corporate sector is no stranger to this kind of safety obsession. There is the phenomenon of 'woke capital,' where the corporations find the latest celebrity cause-du-jour and use it as a marketing strategy.  There is currently an extreme risk aversion in management science. Companies will now do basically anything to avoid 'a kid getting hurt' or someone's delicate sensibilities being offended.  Education from kindergarten up to the universities[18]is increasingly about teaching doctrines and ideology, rather than critical thinking and problem solving skills. All of this is a dangerous admixture that combines the full weight of the academic, cultural and business elites in this country. And its consequences are far reaching.  Trigger Warnings and Safe Spaces  For those unaware, a 'trigger warning' is a person's advisory that disturbing content is going to be posted. However, in an example of concept creep, the meaning of 'disturbing' has become expanded to mean, well, just about anything that might offend a leftist. It is also sometimes known as a 'content warning,' 'TW' or 'CW.'    A similar concept is that of a 'safe space.' What used to be a term used for a place where people in actual danger of physical harm could express themselves, a 'safe space' now means a place where there is no room for disagreement or questions because language is literally violence.  This might all sound very silly and we definitely agree that it is. However, it is quickly becoming de rigeur not just in academia, which is increasingly functioning as a bizarre combination of a daycare center for 21 year olds and an indoctrination program, but also in the corporate world and in the media.  It's not surprising that such foolishness has reached our corporate elites, because so many figures within that world come from the Ivy League. Harvard Law, for example, was the center of a controversy wherethey were urged not to teach rape law or even use the word 'violate'[19](which makes it pretty hard to talk about violations of the law). A Harvard professor argued that greater anxiety among students to discuss complicated and nuanced sxual assault cases was impeding the ability of professors to adequately teach their students. This in turn would lead to poorly prepared attorneys for rape victims in the future.  Beyond a simple discussion in the academic sphere, there are student groups on campus who urge students not to attend or participate in class discussions focused on sxual violence. The same student groups advocate for warning students in advance so they can skip out on class and even to exclude 'triggering' material from tests. Once again, the real victims here are the victims of sxual assault whose attorneys will be ill-prepared to advise them, to say nothing of the cumulative effect on the prosecutorial environment.  Northwestern University professorLaura Kipnis[20]was subject to a lengthy investigation by a kangaroo court andfrivolous Title IX complaints[21]over an article she wrote forThe Chronicle of Higher Education[22]about campus sx panics. Top comedians like Chris Rocknow refuse to perform on college campuses[23], a place that has typically been their bread and butter.  Another key term to understand here is'microaggressions'[24]which means just about anything. Offensive statements under this umbrella include things like 'I don't see race,' 'America is the land of opportunity' and 'I believe the most qualified person should get the job.'  To readers of Generation X or older, this all might sound like a resurgence of political correctness and, indeed, to some extent it is. However, there is something different about the current anti-speech craze sweeping not just campuses, but also boardrooms: Political correctness was, at least in theory, about the elimination of so-called 'hate speech' (for example, using 'mentally disabled' instead of 'retarded' or 'little person' instead of 'midget') and also about broadening the canon of literature to include more women and minorities.  One doesn't need to agree with either objective or be as generous as we are to see that the West has entered a new, accelerated and intensified version of the old political correctness that is qualitatively more dangerous. The 'safe spaces' phase of this is about eliminating anything and everything that might be emotionally troubling to students on campus.  This assumes a high degree of fragility among American college students. But perhaps this assumption isn't totally off base.  The Road to Safety Obsession  If you were born before 1985 or so, your childhood was vastly different than of those born after you. As a child, you probably came and went as you pleased, letting your parents know where you were going, who you would be with and when you might be home. You rode your bike without a helmet and if you were bullied at school there's a good chance that you view this as a character-building experience, not one of deep emotional trauma.  So what happened?  A few things. First, in 1984, the'missing child' milk carton[25]was introduced. America became obsessed with child abduction in response to several high-profile child kidnappings over the period of a few years.Etan Platz[26],Adam Walsh[27]andJohnny Gosch[28]are just three of the names known to Americans during this time period. In September 1984, the Des Moines, Iowa-based Anderson Erickson Dairy began printing the pictures of Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin on milk cartons. Chicago followed suit, then the entire state of California. In December 1984, a nationwide program was launched to keep the faces of abducted children front and center in the American mind.    The milk cartons didn't find many kids, but they did create the panic of 'stranger danger,' where children were taught to fear strangers even though the lion's share of child abduction, molestation and abuse comes from friends, family and other trusted figures such as public school teachers or camp counselors.Most missing children in America are runaways and in 99 percent of all child abductions, the perpetrator is a non-custodial father.[29]There is at least one case of 'stranger danger' being harmful -a lost 11-year-old Boy Scout[30]who thought his rescuers were looking to kidnap him.  Some of the protocols established out of this were useful, such asAMBER Alerts and Code Adam[31]. Awareness of child abduction in general was raised and as a result there's significantly fewer child abductions today than there were in 1980. Indeed,stranger abduction isincrediblyrare in the United States[32]. But this has come with a dark side.  You might be familiar with the myriad of cases in suburban America where children playing alone arearrested by the police[33]because they don't have adult supervision. The parents are then questioned by the police or, in some cases, the state'sChild Protective Services[34].  There was also the panic after themass shooting at Columbine High School[35], which led to the bubble wrapping of schools alongside the home.'Zero tolerance' policies[36]were implemented alongsideschool-wide peanut butter bans[37].  And so the result is that there are at least two generations of American children raised in a protective net so tight that they not only have trouble expressing themselves, but alsobeing exposed to failure and discomfort[38]. What began as a good-faith effort to prevent child abduction and increase overall child welfare has ended up, as a side effect, creating a world where children were raised in such safety that they can't even handle being upset.  This has not only insulated children from the consequences of their own actions and the normal pains of growing up, but also gives the impression that no matter what their problems, 'adults' are ready to step in and save the day at any moment.  It's worth noting that, in recent years, there has beena sharp rise in mental illness among young people[39], both on campus and off, including those with severe mental health problems.  Copsand the 24-Hour News Cycle  There are two other cultural phenomena worth exploring: The television seriesCopsand the 24-hour cable news cycle. As of April 2020,Copsis still on the air, having moved from Fox to Spike TV in 2013.    Copswas more than just a TV series, it was a cultural phenomenon that changed television. Thecinma vrit[40]style used by the show was to be copied in the 90s by virtually every reality show you can name. Curiously, it came out around the same time that crime rates had plummeted comparatively to the 70s and 80s. And just at that time, people started having the worst in human behavior beamed into their homes for entertainment every Saturday night.  At the same time, CNN was bringing news into your home 24 hours a day without end. This meant they had to fill programming around the clock - and most news is bad news. So in addition to a hugely popular program centered around chasing criminals in the act, Americans also had a constant stream of bad news and dangerous events pumped into their homes. The result was the end of the 'free range child,' the kind who learned through play and discovered risk management through trial and error. This was replaced with children whose entire existence was micromanaged by adults, with little to no unsupervised play time.  The ability to learn through failure is a well-established principle going back to the Greeks, who called itpathemata mathemata('guide your learning through pain'). The knowledge and wisdom gained through failure and pain are arguably more lasting and valuable than those learned in school.  The Generation Gap: Millennials and Gen Z  Older generations (Generation X and Baby Boomers) have a tendency to conflate Millennials and Gen Z (also known as 'Zoomers'). However, there are two key differences, one cultural and one clinical: First, Zoomers are much more digital natives than their Millennial counterparts. They didn't get constant internet access or mobile access at college. They've had it since they were in middle school in many cases.  While this is bound to create secondary cultural differences, we know of one clinical difference between Millennials and Zoomers:Zoomers are much more prone to mental illness[41], specifically depression, anxiety, alcoholism and self-harm.  Depression and anxiety in particular arethrough the roof for girls[42], with moderate increases for boys. While self-reported cases are up, we also have harder clinical data: There has been a62 percent increase in hospital admissions[43].  The Baby Boomers and Gen Xers created an environment where it issafer than ever to be a child[44], but at what cost? There has been widespread and verifiable psychological damage done to the younger generation, which is likely being compounded by the coddling taking place in our nation's universities.  Screen Time and Social Media  'Screen time' is the new obsession for parents, especially among, ironically, those who work in high-tech Silicon Valley jobs such asSteve Jobs, father of the iPhone[45]. But there seems to be an emerging consensus among those who have actually studied the topic that the problem isn't 'screen time' per se, but rather the more specific use of itin the form of social media[46]. This has been identified as the cause of depression and anxiety, particularly among girls.  Why is social media usage particularly impactful among girls? Dr. Haidt and others postulate that it's because they are more sensitive to the'perfect' lives being lived by beautiful social media influencers[47]- at least the lives that they lead online. What's more, there is a lot of exclusion and bullying taking place on social media. In days past, you only heard about the party you didn't get invited to, but now you get to watch it unfold in real time on Snapchat or other platforms. Andcyberbullying[48]is much harder to track and police than its real world equivalent.  There's a related bubble wrapping going on with regard to a different sort of screen time: Kids today are often forbidden from playing with plastic guns or even finger guns. There is the notorious case of the 7-year-old child who wassuspended for biting a Pop Tart toaster pastry into the shape of a gun[49]. But millions of children come home (from the same schools where finger guns can warrant a suspension) to play Grand Theft Auto for hours on end.  Indeed, there is some evidence that suggests thatviolent movies and video games[50]can trigger violent thoughts in some, but not all, people who view them. The National Institute of Mental Health has done anextensive study[51]detailing the impact that violent media has on those who view it.  A Nation Divided  There's not much hyperbole in saying that America is barely a single nation anymore. We talk about 'red states' and 'blue states,' but the divide is much deeper than that. Even the coastal states largely have an urban college-educated Democratic population and a rural non-college-educated Republican population.    While some animosity between different areas of the political spectrum, or even resentment of cities by the countryside and vice versa,is nothing new[52], the rancor took off sharply in the early 2000s following the controversial election of George W. Bush and his expanded imperial presidencyafter 9/11[53].  Social mediamakes it easier[54]for extremes to amplify their anger. What's more, it's much easier for people to become part of an online crusade - or witch hunt - than it is for them to do so without it.  This is a big part of what is behind the string of disinvitations and protests on American college campuses. No one, especially young people (where 'young' means 'under 30'), can bear to listen to the opinions of someone they don't agree with. Disinvitations aren't limited to highly controversial figures like MILO and Richard Spencer, or even the decidedly much more vanilla Ann Coulter.Condoleeza Rice[55], the first black female Secretary of State, was disinvited in 2014, as was the first female head of the IMF and the first female finance minister of a G8 nation,Christine Lagarde[56].  Because Americans increasingly refuse even to listen to arguments from the other side, inserting instead a strawman in favor ofreasoned debate[57], there is no reason to believe that the American political and ideological divide will not increase.  The Evolution of Victimhood Culture  America and the West have largely adopted a victimhood culture. It is worth taking a minute to trace this radical transformation of values in the West from its origins.  The earliest societies in the West were honor cultures. While it sounds like a no-brainer that we should return to an honor culture, we should unpack precisely what this means. An honor culture usually means a lot of interpersonal violence. Small slights must be dealt with through dead violence - because a gentleman cannot take any kind of stain on his honor. Dueling and blood feuds are common in these kinds of cultures.  This is superseded by dignity culture. Dignity culture is different, because people are presumed to have dignity regardless of what others think of them. In a dignity culture, people are admired because they have a 'thick skin' and are able to brush off slights even if they are seriously insulting. While we might find ourselves offended, even rightfully so, it is considered important to rise above the offense and conduct ourselves with dignity. Everyone heard some variant of 'sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me' growing up as a child. This is perhaps the key phrase of a dignity culture.  Victimhood culture is concerned with status in a similar manner to honor culture. Indeed, people become incredibly intolerant of any kind of perceived slight, much in the manner of an honor culture. However, in a victimhood culture, it is being offended, taking offense, and being a victim thatprovidesone with status.  Victimhood culture means that people are divided into classes, where victims are good and oppressors are bad. There is an eternal conflict with eternal grievances that can never fully be corrected or atoned for. People feel the need to constantly walk on eggshells and censor themselves. This leads to an overall emphasis on safety, as even words become 'violence' - we need trigger warnings and safe spaces to protect us.  Victimhood culture is closely associated with safety culture. Safety culture is, above all else,debilitating. Those who choose a marginalized identity - and in the contemporary West, a marginalized identity is almostalwaysa choice - become more fragile and more dependent on the broader society. At the same time, the powerful elements in society gain a stake in reinforcing this marginalized identity.The Great Society[58]provides a case study in this dynamic.  Those who do not receive the so-called 'benefits' of safety culture are frequently more prepared for the real world. Who would you rather hire? Someone who studied hard in a rigorous discipline for four years or someone who spent four years being coddled in what is basically a day care center for twentysomethings? With this in mind, it's not too big of a leap to see that straight white men might actually have become 'privileged' through the process of not having access to the collective hugbox in higher education.  The Role of Lawyers and Litigation  There is a relationship with the litigious society in which we live with warning labels everywhere, often for hazards that would seem incredibly obvious to most observant people. In previous generations, even power tools didn't come with warnings to roll your sleeves up or take off your watch. This information was either common sense or passed along in high school shop classes or on the job.  However, the American legal system has no penalty for frivolous lawsuits, which has led to an explosion in the number of lawsuits. There is a massive army of lawyers in the United States (which hasa surplus of some 40 percent[59]) whose profession revolves around finding aggrieved parties who weren't properly 'warned' - or indeed to be able to help write the warning labels themselves. These labels do not even exist for actual safety. The same type of person who is going to do the thing being warned against is likely the same type of person who doesn't read warnings. The labels are simply there as a form of 'CYA' for the firms who make them.    That said, to a certain degree, the 'litigious society' is a myth. The oft-citedMcDonald's coffee burn[60]is actuallymore reasonable than people are aware[61]: The elderly woman in question who was burned simply wanted McDonald's - who kept their coffee extra hot to prevent people from taking part of their 'free refills' policy - to pay for her skin graft resulting from the burn. When McDonald's refused to settle this out of court and the case went to trial, they were rewarded for their efforts at stonewalling with punitive damages.  So the main example of frivolous lawsuits is a big strawman. But to be clear -frivolous lawsuits are real[62]. One great example of an actually frivolous lawsuit was the man who sued his dry cleaner for $67 million because theydelivered his pants to the wrong person[63]. There was no actual damage here and it's difficult to express just how ridiculous the dollar figure claimed was. This case was thrown out of court, as most of these types of cases are. Still, litigants pursue them either to get media attention or to harass the defendant or both, a phenomenon known as 'lawfare.' And these cases clog up genuine claims in the courts.  Civil trials are long and drawn-out things. And with40 million[64]of them in the United States every year andover a million lawyers[65], it's unsurprising that the system has become clogged with lawsuits, many of which are either totally frivolous (remember - there's no penalty for filing a frivolous lawsuit in America) or just the type of thing that should be either settled or handled through binding arbitration.  While the litigious society exists in parallel to the 'safe spaces' of college campuses, it is worth noting because it is part of the larger bubble wrapping of the American landscape. The same kids who were raised with helicopter parents and a general sense that they had a 'right' to never be offended were likewise raised in an environment where people could be sued for anything or, at the very least, this was the public perception. It is just another factor of risk aversion in American life.  There are other consequences of having too many lawyers around and having them congregate within our political class: Words are chosen to obfuscate and laws proliferate, as legislation becomes a sort of 'jobs program' for lawyers. The more laws we have,the less free we are[66]and the less social trust we have. As laws, regulations, and agenciestake the place of civil society[67], the state grows at the expense of everything else and the less trust we have in our society.  Overreacting to the Wuhan Coronavirus  In 2020, theWuhan Coronavirus[68]broke out of China and spread all around the world. The world had not seen a deadly, contagious virus with such scope since theSpanish flu pandemic of 1918 to 1920[69]. At first, the response was denial and apathy. However, this quickly gave way to what could be considered a massive overreaction: Shutting everything down.  There was a certain logic to this: If people gathering together were what was spreading the virus, then simply keep people apart until the whole thing blows over. However, this is also potentially a huge overreaction. It is amedical solution in the driver's seat[70]without any nod to the economic, social or military consequences that flow from it. Even if one agrees that medical solutions are to be the primary driver, it does not follow that they are theonlydriver.    Because of the lopsided and often hysterical reaction, many of the proposed solutions don't even make sense: For example, telling everyone they can go to the supermarket while prohibiting them from going to small offices, orshutting down the border between the United States and Canada[71]- two countries with highly infected populations and a sprawling border that is largely unpatrolled.  A brief disclaimer: None of us are epidemiologists or virologists. And we defer to their superior knowledge on this subject.  However, during the Spanish flu pandemic, life did not shut down quite so completely as it has during the Coronavirus pandemic. The methods used during the Spanish flu were isolation of the sick, mask wearing in public, and cancellation of large events. In places where these were practiced rigorously, there was a significant decline in the number of infections and death.St. Louis in particular[72]is known as an exemplar of what to do during an easily transmissible epidemic.  'The economy' has been cited as a reason the total shutdown of life during the Coronavirus pandemic was a poor idea. This might sound frivolous, but the mass unemployment not only leads to destitution for those when the economy is so paralyzed that there are no other jobs forthcoming. It also leads toa spike in the suicide rate[73]. There is a certain calculus that must be done - how much unemployment is worth how much death from Wuhan Coronavirus?  The reaction to this virus is noteworthy, because it is the first major pandemic of this new, insulated and coddled age. Rather than reasonable measures to mitigate death, the choice made was to do anything and everything possible to prevent death entirely. Not only might this be an unwise decision, it might be a fool's errand: The virus seems to be muchmore contagious[74]than was previously thought, as well asmuch less lethal[75].  More than one reasonable person has asked what would happen if we all just went about our lives making reasonable precautions, such as hand washing, mask wearing, social distancing, and the cancellation of large events like sports and concerts. This is effectivelywhat Sweden has done[76]and it appears to work, especially when contrasted withtheir neighbors in Finland[77]who have done basically the same as America. How much sense does it make to have the entire community converge upon its grocery stores while not allowing anyone to go into an office, ever? Compare this with what has passed for reasonable reaction: Closing down every school, every dine-in restaurant, and the government dictating which businesses are essential and which aren't.  A big motivator of this is a compulsion to not lose a single life to the Wuhan Coronavirus, which is a totally unreasonable goal. People are going to die. The question isn't 'how tightly do we have to lock the country down to ensure no one dies,' but rather 'what are reasonable measures we can take to balance public safety against personal choice and social cohesion?'  The splintering and division of America in practice has meant that theestablishment conservative media was largely in denial over the virus for weeks[78]. It is not a liberal smear to say that the amount of denialism from establishment conservative media, pundits, think tanks, bureaucrats and elected officials has in practice meant that America responded much more slowly and conservatively than it might have with a more unified America body politic.  At the beginning of spring 2020, the virus seemed poised todevastate the American South[79], which largely stuck with the early conservative media denialism, eschewing social distancing, shuttering of certain public places and mask wearing. Again, a more united body politic and the media and trust in the media that goes along with that might have prevented a lot of illness and death.  Imagine the impact of Walter Cronkite or Edward Murrow going on television and telling the American public to mask up and maintain distance versus the impact of Rachel Maddow and Tucker Carlson doing it.  What Is Vindictive Protectiveness?  'Vindictive protectiveness' was a term coined by Haidt and Lukianoff to describe the environment on America's college campuses with regard to speech codes and similar. However, it can refer more broadly to the cultural atmosphere in the United States and the West today. From the college campus to the corporate boardroom to the office, Americans have to watch what they say and maybe even what they think lest they fall afoul of extra-legal speech and thought codes.  Perhaps worst of all, an entire generation is being raised to see this not only as normal, but asbeneficial. This means that as this generation comes of age and grows into leadership positions, that there is a significant chance that these codes will be enforcedmorerigorously, not less. And while there may be ebbs and flows (political correctness went into hibernation for pretty much the entire administration of George W. Bush - though to be fair, there was an imperfect replacement in the form of post-9/11 jingoism), the current outrage factory is much more concerning than the one that sort of just hung around in the background in the 1990s.  Put plainly: the next wave will be worse. We may not haveMaoist-style Red Guards[80]in America quite yet, but we're not far off and the emphasis should be on 'yet.'

Given the limited room for manoeuvre, it looks like he's done a good job.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Further cuts to business rates for small businesses will come as a welcome boost to local high streets and bringing forward the increase in the personal allowance should put more money in people's pockets.</p><p>I like the digital infrastructure spending, while halving the apprenticeship levy for small and medium-sized enterprises should help to improve social mobility, a key issue in the Midlands, where Severn Trent is based.</p><p>As a major backer of the Refill campaign, which aims to put water refill points in every major British city by 2021, I was also glad to see steps to cut down on plastic pollution with the new tax on plastic packaging. I would love to see the government maintain its focus on that front.</p><p>                     Sir Ian Cheshire                                          Chairman, Debenhams and Barclays UK                     The government seems to be trying to reach out beyond the London bubble and connect with local economies. Allocating \u00a3500 million for housing and \u00a3675 million for high streets is a great start and the rates relief for small retailers helps, even if 70 per cent of the rates burden is paid by big businesses such as Debenhams.</p><p>While a digital tax is interesting, a real review of rates in a digital economy still needs to take place. You also don't get more local than giving money to potholes, toilets and tree planting.</p><p>Overall, the economy and government finances look slightly better than previously thought. Reducing the deficit and debt levels remain vital, but so too is lifting the nation's spirits, so announcing the end of austerity is an important inflection point.</p><p>                     Anne Boden                                          Chief executive, Starling Bank                     It's heartening to see the chancellor speaking of his support for the small business owners and entrepreneurs who form the backbone of the UK economy. With the massive shift to self-employment - the 4.8 million self-employed are 15 per cent of the workforce - it's more important than ever.</p><p>Cutting business rates by a third for smaller retailers in England is an important step and will help half a million small and medium-sized enterprises. The freeze on fuel duty will help small enterprises that rely on cars and vans.</p><p>Extending the new enterprise allowance, which helps the long-term unemployed to set up businesses, halving the small businesses funding level for apprenticeships to 5 per cent and providing training support for the self-employed are a shot in the arm for entrepreneurs.</p><p>                     Rooney Anand                                          Chief executive, Greene KingThis is a constructive budget, with the government backing business and listening to widespread concerns about the heavy burden of regulation and costs on pubs and local communities. The decision to freeze beer duty is good news for customers and offers valuable support to the industry. Brexit also gives the government a chance to reset the UK duty regime. Britons pay three times the average rate of beer duty per unit in Europe and addressing this disparity could provide significant support to pubs and brewers.</p><p>Moves to support the high street through a digital services tax and cuts to business rates are an important step in the right direction, and will go a long way to restoring the balance between bricks-and-mortar businesses and big tech companies.</p><p>                     Peter Williams                                           Chairman, boohoo.com                     There were two main measures to support the high street. First, small retailers will see their business rates bills cut by a third for two years, saving them \u00a3900 million. Second, local high streets will benefit from \u00a3675 million to improve transport links, redevelop empty shops as homes and offices, and restore and reuse old properties.</p><p>I would put all the money into the second of these measures. The amount of physical retail space has long been disproportionate to consumer demand, and this has only become more so since the advent of the internet and the resulting effect on consumer behaviour.</p><p>Temporarily propping up uneconomic retail enterprises distracts from the immediate need, which is to transform unused retail spaces into mixed-use environments including leisure, art installations, public realm and housing.</p><p>                     Pete Redfern                                          Chief executive,Taylor Wimpey                     Perhaps the most interesting change in the budget for the housing sector is set out in the red book itself. The chancellor has extended Help to Buy until 2023 for first-time buyers alone, with regional price caps and has announced that the scheme will then end.</p><p>We have always argued that the scheme should not become permanent and that a sensible tapering over a period of time was needed for the benefit of individual homebuyers and market stability. The focus in the final two years of the scheme on purely first-time buyers is appropriate for a group who are most in need of this support.</p><p>While the withdrawal of the scheme in nearly five years' time will cause concern for some, we believe that this approach is necessary for the long-term health and fairness of the market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-48738654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKY-TRB1-F021-64Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 30, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Apple has been hustling to get a nod from the government for setting up its retail stores in India to boost slumping sales. After about three years, Apple may see an opportunity to pitch its fresh proposal to open the iconic Apple Stores across India.</p><p>While giving her speech, the Finance Minister said FDI inflows in India have been \"robust\" as the global investment into India's sectors has slid by 13 per cent in 2018 from $1.3 trillion from $1.5 trillion. At large, these lucid norms in local sourcing will attract Apple and other smartphone companies to grow their offline presence by opening wholly-owned stores.</p><p>Presently crippled by the strain induced by the regulatory mandates between the US and China, Apple is mulling ways to remove the roadblocks, which includes moving the manufacturing to other markets with an abundance of cheap labour. India has come across as a lucrative market that holds potential for the big tech companies to tap into the demographic that has shown the capacity to afford premium products.</p><p>Apple did not respond to our query immediately.</p><p>But Apple has more diverse plans for India - it has been wanting to bring the Apple Stores to India to boost sales in the offline market. However, the clause of 'cutting-edge technology' in Apple's pitch to the government painted an unfavourable picture while availing rebates in the process of setting up the retail stores. If the proposal materialises in the Parliament, it will be of aid to the Cupertino-based company.</p><p>\"Apple will gain momentum in its plans of opening the Apple Stores in India that have been delayed for quite some time,\" said Tarun Pathak, Research Director at the research firm Counterpoint Research. Analysts are terming Sitharaman's proposal beneficial not only for Apple but for other brands that have been eyeing to penetrate into the retail sector, which has been dominated by the likes of mom-and-pop stores in India. \"Apple will eventually focus on manufacturing the latest iPhone models on a mass scale in India after it manages to open the Apple Stores,\" Pathak added when asked about the prospects in the expansion of manufacturing facility by Apple.</p><p>Amid the tentativeness that Sitharaman's proposal has offered, Apple was recently reported to be securing three top spots in various localities of Mumbai to begin the greenfield project ahead of formalising the setting of Apple Stores. It is not clear whether the locations marked by Apple have been finalised, or whether the company has come to the terms of acquiescence.</p><p>OnePlus, one of the leading premium smartphone companies in India, announced it will set up the world's largest facility that will be a one-stop centre for the company's entire portfolio in Hyderabad. The company is increasing its investments into the Indian smartphone market but at the same time, it is stressing the need for transitioning from the online space to the offline retail market, which still accounts for driving volume sales.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0048479979</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH4-3431-DXMP-K0Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

This shows a lack of trust. Chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all don't want to happen in Singapore,\" said Prof Yaacob on the first day of the Budget debate.</p><p>The Member of Parliament for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency said that the rush to stock up food items over the \"fateful\" weekend, following the raising of Singapore's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition to Orange on Feb 7, is a reminder of the importance in getting communications right.</p><p>\"During Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts from various platforms and from friends and strangers alike,\" said Prof Yaacob.</p><p>While noting that the Government had responded decisively to the Covid-19\u00a0crisis and that he had full confidence in the ministerial team heading the national response, Prof Yaacob said that the issue of trust during the current crisis merits discussion.</p><p>He said the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma), which had been employed during the Covid-19 outbreak to curb misinformation about the crisis situation, is still viewed by some as an attempt by the Government to stifle dissent on the Internet.</p><p>\"There is a sense among them that the Government is using this legislation for its own agenda rather than serving the needs of our people,\" said Prof Yaacob.</p><p>He recalled how a similar concern emerged when he was Minister for Communications and Information.</p><p>In 2013, he moved to license online news websites which several had claimed would kill the diversity of online voices.</p><p>\"As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the internet. All we wanted, and I am sure all of us can agree to this, is responsible behaviour on the internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans,\" he said.</p><p>As Singapore grapples with more complex issues, such as climate change, he urged the Government to build trust that \"it is doing what is right for our people even though it means spending significant resources over a very long-term period to benefit future generations\".</p><p>On the use of technology, such as the closed-circuit television cameras placed in void decks for example, Prof Yaacob said Singaporeans trusted that the Government was using the camera data for good, but the same cannot be said for citizens in other countries that also have such cameras in common areas.</p><p>While Singapore has done well so far, there may be some who may raise issues of privacy and how their data is used. The emergence of data legislation globally such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation\u00a0and California Consumer Privacy Act may cause groups to question if Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act is sufficiently rigorous.</p><p>\"For our digitalisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that their data is collected solely for the purpose of developing services useful for them,\" said Prof Yaacob.</p><p>Among the questions that will be asked are whether the Government can protect its citizens from being manipulated by big tech giants and whether Singaporeans can trust the Government to use personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and \"not some political agenda\", he added.</p><p>Reiterating that Singaporeans have high trust in their public institutions, such as hospitals, schools, the judiciary and security agencies, Prof Yaacob said it is because they are well-managed, staffed by capable people and have a record in delivering fair and good outcomes.</p><p>\"We trust that these institutions will do what is right and just,\" he said.</p><p>This trust between people and Government will be strained as Singapore grapples with issues as its society and economy digitalises, he added, noting that in other societies where trust had broken down, there was also the rise of populism.</p><p>\"With social media and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes it is unclear whether the lack of trust in government is an effect of all these developments or it is the cause for the rise of alternative centres of trust,\" he said.</p><p>With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are also associated with ethical issues, he mooted the creation of an independent \"Digital Commission\" that looks at these concerns from all sides dispassionately.</p><p>Such a commission would be similar to the Bioethics Advisory Committee that was established in 2000 and looked into issues of human biomedical research, he said.</p><p>\"Just like the trust we have in our other public institutions, should we not consider similar public institutions that can build trust in our people in dealing with these new technologies?\"</p><p>Prof Yaacob, who stepped down from the Cabinet in April 2018, said he raised the concern of trust in Government because of the unavoidable \"nagging concerns of privacy and transparency\" as Singapore digitalises its economy and society.</p><p>If Singapore does not deal with this early, then trust in the Government can be eroded, he warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-6217871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y99-83S1-JB7G-04B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The agency said Friday that more than 90% of that staff, or 3,637, would be furloughed in the case of a shutdown - 174 will remain to handle enforcement activity, while 158 will be retained to 'protect life or property.'</p><p>The bigger issue lies with funding, or rather, a lack thereof, Schapiro said.</p><p>Congress sets the SEC's budget, providing the government agency with the resources to regulate financial markets and protect investors, as well as the ability to implement pending financial reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act.</p><p>\"Insufficient funding for the SEC means fewer cops on the beat, even though fraudsters show no sign of backing off,\" she said.</p><p>And a government shutdown will only exacerbate the problem.</p><p>\"Insufficient funding for the SEC means an investor protection effort hobbled at a time when the events of the last decade have proved that effective enforcement of the securities laws is more important than ever,\" Schapiro said.</p><p>There was one semi-bright spot.

This time, the multimillionaire's new option seems to have left markets convinced that this was an operation against the Economic System of the United States.<br/>    This is because Buffett showed a lack of confidence in banks, in favor of corporate stocks. Berskshire, the company buffett owns, sold 85.6 million shares it held in Wells Fargo - about 26% of its share - reducing its stake from 5.3% to 3%. In addition to Wells Fargo, it also withdrew 61% of its position at JP Morgan through the sale of 35.5 million shares. In addition to the banks, the company also desinted PNC Financial Services.<br/>At the same time, it took a stake in The Barrick Gold, with about 21 million shares valued at US$563 million.<br/>Buffett assumed he's been wrong this whole time at a press conference. \"They [interest rates] are going to be negative for a long time. It's better to have stocks, something other than debt securities.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Betting against the U.S. economy</emphasis>According to MarketWatch, buffett's operation could be a bet against the U.S. economy, a vote of no confidence in how banks can manage the current crisis.<br/>It also marks a change in the north-American investor's view of gold.\u00a0Buffett has long criticized the precious metal as an investment, as he has always considered it \"of no use.\"<br/>Mike Shedlock, an analyst at Sitka Pacific Capital Management, explains that \"Buffet knows that the financial sector is struggling due to covid-19. And Barrick pays a good dividend,\" adding that \"in addition, Barrick is only a small slice of its overall cake\", as the investor continues with his holdings in various banks and technology companies, such as Apple or Amazon. <br/>Banking stocks in the United States and around the world have had a major impact this year, as major institutions have been forced to set aside tens of billions of dollars in provisions to compensate for potential failures in loan payments.<br/>Buffett currently has nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio at technology firm Apple, contradicting his theory of moving away from technology bonds, since he preferred to devote himself only to what he really perceived, according to himself.<br/>Despite this contradiction, Buffett now seems to be taking to the letter one of his other theories about equity investing: \"diversity was a protection against ignorance.\" According to the philanthropist, \"it makes little sense [to diversify investments] if we know exactly what we're doing.\"<br/>Warren Buffett has long been known as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" because of his accurate predictions, having always taken advantage of the times of crisis to make new business.<br/>However, the covid-19 pandemic appears to be challenging for the leading conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, which posted losses of $49.7 billion in the first quarter of this year. These figurescompared to profits of $21.7 billion recorded by the Omaha, Nebraska-based holding company in the same period last year.<br/>It recently lost ground on the world's richest list, surpassed by big tech big names, the sector that benefited the most in a global pandemic year.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13882757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M9-VFX1-DY1R-B14B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

And Indians finished second to Americans to take home $2.3 million, or 10%, of that, according to HackerOne, a bug bounty platform.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bug bounty hunters \u2013 or White Hat hackers as they are also called \u2013 detect and report vulnerabilities in software programmes. They do it legally, and they earn a reward from the software owner. The vulnerability could be a weak password, or a bug in the software that causes it to crash or produce invalid results or makes it easy for a third party to illegally access it.</p><p>Anand Prakash is one of India's leading bug bounty hunters. He says he has earned Rs 2.5 crore through bounty programmes. He hacked for the first time when a friend challenged him to hack into his Orkut account. It was 2008, and Prakash was then preparing for IIT-JEE in Kota. Prakash didn't crack JEE, but he succeeded in hacking into his friend's account, and that turned the rookie engineer into a bug bounty hunter.</p><p>He is today in Facebook and Twitter's hall of fame. In 2017, he found a bug on Twitter that allowed him to tweet from any Twitter account. He reported the bug to Twitter and they fixed the flaw immediately. Prakash is ranked among the top bug bounty hunters on Uber. \u201cOn a weekend, I opened the Uber app and spotted account takeover vulnerabilities,\u201d he says.</p><p>Chennai-based security researcher Laxman Muthiyah found a vulnerability on Instagram that allowed him to hack any Instagram account without consent permission. The Facebook and Instagram security team fixed the issue and he won a $30,000 bounty.</p><p>Every five minutes, a bug bounty hunter somewhere in the world reports a software vulnerability. The gig economy of bug bounty hunt- ing has recorded a steep growth over the past eight years. New technologies, especially cloud and low-security IoT devices, have massively expanded the horizons for these hunters. \u201cOnly bounty hunters can provide cost-effective security solutions,\u201d says Vikash Chaudhary, founder of consultancy HackersEra. He was ranked 51 in Microsoft's Top 100 security researchers in 2018.</p><p>Hyderabad-based bug hunter Harsha Vardhan Boppana says there are a variety of vulnerabilities. Some of the common ones are XSS (cross site scripting), a vulnerability that can be used by attackers to bypass access controls), CSRF (cross-site request forgery), which allows unauthorised commands to be transmitted from a user that the web application trusts), and SQL injection, which makes it possible to execute malicious statements to control a database server behind a web application. \u201cHigher vulnerabilities can fetch bounties around $5,000-$20,000,\u201d says Boppana, adding that bounty hunters are increasingly moving to mobile apps as spotting bugs on websites has become competitive.</p><p>Organisations like HackerOne and BugCrowd, and non-profit Open Bug Bounty, act as a link between the world's bug hunters and clients who are looking for security solutions. HackerOne, founded in 2012 by two Dutch hackers whose vulnerability reports were initially rejected by big tech firms, now has over 450,000 registered hackers. HackerOne has helped fix over 120,000 vulnerabilities for 1,400 clients, earning hackers more than $62 million in awards, nearly half of that in the past year alone.</p><p>India's software prowess has ensured that her tech wizards are claiming their fair share of fame and dime. The 2019 HackerOne security report says that hackers from India and the US alone account for 38% of its community members. HackerOne in fact allows vulnerability submissions in Hindi, Telugu, Marathi and Tamil.</p><p>Hacker-powered security is on the rise in risk-averse and highly regulated industries such as financial services, banking, insurance, healthcare and education, says a HackerOne report. Hacker rewards too are going up both on a unit level and in the aggregate. \u201cMicrosoft has expanded the scope of its bounty program to include more Azure cloud products and services,\u201d says the company's senior program manager for the Bug Bounty Program, Jarek Stanley. This year, he says, it launched bounties for Azure DevOps and Dynamics 365, with rewards up to $20,000, as well as a set of dedicated Azure hosts to test attacks against infrastructure-as-a-service scenarios with awards up to $300,000. In 2018, Microsoft awarded more than $90,000 in bounty to India-based researchers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_49_02102019016003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5V-GBF1-DXJR-H172-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

And Indians finished second to Americans to take home $2.3 million, or 10%, of that, according to HackerOne, a bug bounty platform.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bug bounty hunters \u2013 or White Hat hackers as they are also called \u2013 detect and report vulnerabilities in software programmes. They do it legally, and they earn a reward from the software owner. The vulnerability could be a weak password, or a bug in the software that causes it to crash or produce invalid results or makes it easy for a third party to illegally access it.</p><p>Anand Prakash is one of India's leading bug bounty hunters. He says he has earned Rs 2.5 crore through bounty programmes. He hacked for the first time when a friend challenged him to hack into his Orkut account. It was 2008, and Prakash was then preparing for IIT-JEE in Kota. Prakash didn't crack JEE, but he succeeded in hacking into his friend's account, and that turned the rookie engineer into a bug bounty hunter.</p><p>He is today in Facebook and Twitter's hall of fame. In 2017, he found a bug on Twitter that allowed him to tweet from any Twitter account. He reported the bug to Twitter and they fixed the flaw immediately. Prakash is ranked among the top bug bounty hunters on Uber. \u201cOn a weekend, I opened the Uber app and spotted account takeover vulnerabilities,\u201d he says.</p><p>Chennai-based security researcher Laxman Muthiyah found a vulnerability on Instagram that allowed him to hack any Instagram account without consent permission. The Facebook and Instagram security team fixed the issue and he won a $30,000 bounty.</p><p>Every five minutes, a bug bounty hunter somewhere in the world reports a software vulnerability. The gig economy of bug bounty hunt- ing has recorded a steep growth over the past eight years. New technologies, especially cloud and low-security IoT devices, have massively expanded the horizons for these hunters. \u201cOnly bounty hunters can provide cost-effective security solutions,\u201d says Vikash Chaudhary, founder of consultancy HackersEra. He was ranked 51 in Microsoft's Top 100 security researchers in 2018.</p><p>Hyderabad-based bug hunter Harsha Vardhan Boppana says there are a variety of vulnerabilities. Some of the common ones are XSS (cross site scripting), a vulnerability that can be used by attackers to bypass access controls), CSRF (cross-site request forgery), which allows unauthorised commands to be transmitted from a user that the web application trusts), and SQL injection, which makes it possible to execute malicious statements to control a database server behind a web application. \u201cHigh impact vulnerabilities can fetch bounties around $5,000-$20,000,\u201d says Boppana, adding that bounty hunters are increasingly moving to mobile apps as spotting bugs on websites has become competitive.</p><p>Organisations like HackerOne and BugCrowd, and non-profit Open Bug Bounty, act as a link between the world's bug hunters and clients who are looking for security solutions. HackerOne, founded in 2012 by two Dutch hackers whose vulnerability reports were initially rejected by big tech firms, now has over 450,000 registered hackers. HackerOne has helped fix over 120,000 vulnerabilities for 1,400 clients, earning hackers more than $62 million in awards, nearly half of that in the past year alone.</p><p>India's software prowess has ensured that her tech wizards are claiming their fair share of fame and dime. The 2019 HackerOne security report says that hackers from India and the US alone account for 38% of its community members. HackerOne in fact allows vulnerability submissions in Hindi, Telugu, Marathi and Tamil.</p><p>Hacker-powered security is on the rise in risk-averse and highly regulated industries such as financial services, banking, insurance, healthcare and education, says a HackerOne report. Hacker rewards too are going up both on a unit level and in the aggregate. \u201cMicrosoft has expanded the scope of its bounty program to include more Azure cloud products and services,\u201d says the company's senior program manager for the Bug Bounty Program, Jarek Stanley. This year, he says, it launched bounties for Azure DevOps and Dynamics 365, with rewards up to $20,000, as well as a set of dedicated Azure hosts to test attacks against infrastructure-as-a-service scenarios with awards up to $300,000. In 2018, Microsoft awarded more than $90,000 in bounty to India-based researchers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_45_03102019008001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-FK41-DXJR-H4FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

If there were any online rummy tournaments, the number of Indian participants was very low. While a large number of Westerners were winning millions of dollars in cash prizes, Indians were not even aware of the online game. Even for those who participated from India,it was difficult to withdraw cash in Indian rupees from a global rummy website. But gone are those days.</p><p>Global rummy and other gaming companies have started investing in India. Today India is one of the hottest gaming hubs, with many global game companies operating in the country. Now, online rummy and other game platforms routinely hold tournaments and offer bonuses legally in Indian currency.</p><p>Some people still have a misconception about rummy and consider playing cash rummy online gambling. But the Supreme Court of India has made it clear in its ruling that playing skill games like online rummy is not gambling and it is perfectly legal in India. Playing the rummy game sharpens one's concentration and analytical skills.</p><p>Gaming industry expansion</p><p>While there has been massive increase in the number of players who play rummy online or any other online games, gaming companies have opened up new employment avenues in India. There are more than 300 gaming start-ups and established companies in India, which help a large number of people earn their bread.</p><p>The skill-gaming industry has generated the interest of many media outlets and venture capitalists that earlier concentrated on the e-commerce industry. To utilize the opportunity, many prominent VCs are showing an interest in investing in industry expansion.</p><p>Career options in the gaming industry</p><p>Compared to western countries, India is still a growing online gaming industry. Though it has reached the metro and a few suburban cities in India, there is a long way to reach the mass audiences in rural areas. So, the industry provides an excellent career opportunity to those who are interested in exploring this new field.</p><p>There are lots of opportunities for developers and designers. People who were earlier looking for jobs at big tech companies are now willing to join gaming companies. International gaming companies are setting their base in India and creating India-centric job opportunities for data scientists and UI designers, UX designers, etc. There's a massive demand for them.</p><p>There's a demand for digital marketing folks because of the competition on search engines and social media platforms for the companies' website rankings. People who understand digital marketing trends have a bright career in the gaming industry.</p><p>The Indian market will see the same growth momentum for many more years to come. The Indian gaming industry is in the initial stages of setting up its self-regulatory bodies. TRF (The Rummy Federation) and IFSG (the Indian Federation of Sports Gaming) have a huge role to play in creating regulations, implementing rules and ensuring the integrity of operators and players.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Within a short span of time in India, gaming companies have shown a promising career path for job seekers. The gaming industry, especially skill-based gaming, has a very bright future in India.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Herald Goa.

Because they are starting from scratch, Mr. Corkum said, the companies can embed smart technology into the energy, water, lighting and transportation systems that will serve the community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project comes at a time when the tech industry is under intense scrutiny. Facebook is struggling with revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, improperly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">harvested private information from 50 million</url> of the social network\u2019s users. And Uber\u2019s travails include a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html\">pedestrian death caused by one of its autonomous vehicles</url> last month.</p><p>Still, LStar is pushing ahead with the smart city, called Union Point. Plans include thousands of housing units and millions of square feet of high-tech commercial space on about 1,500 acres that extend into the neighboring towns of Rockland and Abington. The community\u2019s glass towers, public plazas, clustered housing, scattered parks and retail zones will be contained within 500 acres, leaving the rest as dedicated open space.</p><p>So far, the community consists of about 1,200 occupied single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, as well as a nearly completed $28 million sports complex with a miniature replica of Fenway Park. A cavernous aircraft hangar will be renovated for use as the centerpiece for a downtown district with shops, restaurants and open spaces with public programming.</p><p>General Electric will use Union Point as a laboratory for testing new products and as a showroom for working systems. Eric Gebhardt, the strategic technology officer at GE Power, said the community\u2019s energy plan will include micro grid technology, renewable generation and power storage. The company will also install \u201cintelligent\u201d lighting \u2014 streetlights with sensors that can track sound, light and other conditions. The data can be used to monitor traffic, help drivers find parking spaces and alert law enforcement if a gun is fired.</p><p>G.E. has piloted some of its smart products in existing cities, but Union Point is an unusual opportunity because most of the infrastructure does not exist yet and the developer is open to experimentation, Mr. Gebhardt said.</p><p>LStar plans to open an innovation center in the air station\u2019s old power plant. The center has expressed an interest in featuring an interactive planning tool developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology City Science Group called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cityscope/overview/\">CityScope</url>, which could aid in Union Point\u2019s evolution by allowing users to visualize and explore trade-offs around factors like density, transportation and walkability, said David Rose, a researcher and lecturer at MIT\u2019s Media Lab.</p><p>LStar wants \u201cthe center to be a showcase for what the city could be, a place to monitor what it is becoming, and a place to ask existential questions like, \u2018Could it be more inclusive, say, or energy efficient?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rose said.</p><p>LStar also has an agreement with Optimus Ride, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Boston, to set up a self-driving vehicle service at Union Point. The company is already testing its electric vehicles at the property.</p><p>Union Point\u2019s first commercial tenant is expected this spring, when Prodrive Technologies, a Dutch company that develops and manufactures products for the automotive, medical and other industries, will break ground on its 60,000-square-foot United States headquarters. The site\u2019s proximity to Boston, access to commuter rail service and ample room for expansion were crucial to the firm\u2019s location decision, said Roy Willems, the company\u2019s general manager of United States operations. He said Prodrive expected to build a second 200,000-square-foot building within three years, and increase its work force to roughly 300 people.</p><p>LStar had to persuade the three host communities to approve critical zoning changes before it could move forward with the project. They also granted the developer considerable latitude over the design and layout of the community, which will take shape over 15 to 20 years.</p><p>\u201cThe three towns recognized an opportunity to do something quite extraordinary\u201d on a site where previous development plans stalled, said David P. Manfredi, a founding principal at Elkus Manfredi Architects, which helped create the master plan for Union Point. \u201cThis is an alternative to what could have been suburban sprawl.\u201d</p><p>Union Point promises to bring badly needed tax revenue to Weymouth, said the town\u2019s mayor, Robert L. Hedlund. \u201cIt\u2019s the commercial build-out that we\u2019re lusting after,\u201d he said.</p><p>Still, similarly ambitious smart city projects have proved perilous. Mr. Rose cited <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/05/technology/techspecial/koreas-hightech-utopia-where-everything-is-observed.html\">Songdo, a smart city nearing completion in South Korea</url>, as a prime example. The city boasts advanced connectivity, but it has so far failed to meet expectations in attracting international businesses and residents.</p><p>\u201cWhat they got wrong was any sort of sense of streetscape,\u201d said Mr. Rose, who has visited Songdo. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of patina, no authentic street life. It\u2019s super sterile. It was built as this fantasy of the future, but it\u2019s a place that humans don\u2019t want to occupy.\u201d</p><p>The integration of technology into urban planning has prompted questions about how the data being collected will be used. In Toronto, for example, Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, attracted considerable publicity when it was selected last year to help create a smart neighborhood of sorts in a waterfront district called Quayside. Some local officials and critics <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/sidewalk-labs-toronto-google-risks/\">are questioning</url> whether the deal gives too much authority to Sidewalk Labs without putting limitations on Google\u2019s collection and use of data.</p><p>The need for greater regulation of driverless vehicles has also come up for debate after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/uber-self-driving-cars-arizona.html\">the death last month</url> of a woman who was struck by one of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars in Tempe, Ariz.</p><p>\u201cVery few local governments have thought through the long list of public- and private-sector values and concerns that should be deployed to constrain\u201d the use of autonomous cars, as well as the technologies being used to monitor city streets, said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve given a developer license to deploy total surveillance, with no public limitations, you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>LStar has considerable leeway to test technologies at Union Point. The developer is purposely holding on to its roads, rather than asking for them to be made public ways, to maintain flexibility in testing autonomous vehicles, lighting and other technologies, said Robert Luongo, Weymouth\u2019s director of planning and community development.</p><p>\u201cIf these were public ways, we might not be able to give them that flexibility,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Corkum said retaining ownership of the roads would enable them to play with designs for amenities like drop-off areas for driverless shuttles and heated sidewalks. \u201cIt\u2019s better for us to stay in this testing phase until we have good workable solutions,\u201d he said.</p><p>State oversight of autonomous vehicles applies only once there is public use, he said. Even then, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/03/20/walsh-wants-self-driving-car-regulations-amid-seaport-testing-pause/grIRKwTKL4hFIAmTPhep1M/story.html\">rules are vague</url>. Ryan Chin, the chief executive of Optimus Ride, said his company would adhere to the same high-level safety standards and testing protocols at Union Point that it followed for testing driverless cars in Boston\u2019s Seaport neighborhood.</p><p>As for privacy concerns, Mr. Corkum said that he believed in setting boundaries on data collection and use. There is value in using technology to improve quality of life by, for instance, alleviating traffic jams, but he said he was wary of falling prey to a \u201cpreoccupation with optimization.\u201d</p><p>The company is working with law firms and consultants on operating guidelines for gathering and anonymizing data and ensuring it cannot be hacked or used to invade privacy, he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the Big Brother notion that we know everything about you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will use data for the benefit of the group, not in a way to leverage the group.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: A rendering of the development Union Point, a &amp;ldquo;smart city&amp;rdquo; planned for Weymouth, Mass.

But, in truth, everyone is fair game. It is not off-limits to troll survivors of gun violence, like the students of Parkland, who advocate for saner gun laws; to shame victims of sexual abuse; to post racist, anti-Semitic, sexist, homophobic, anti-immigrant rants; or to ridicule people whose only sin is that they disagree with you. </p><p>This is happening in our communities, our workplaces, and even on our college campuses. Today, such behaviors are dismissed with a shrug. They can even get you tens of millions of followers and a prime-time spot on a cable TV network\u2014 or send you to the White House. It is all representative of a problem endemic to our society. Some social scientists call it an 'empathy crisis.' It is the inability to put yourself in another's shoes and feel compassion, sympathy, and kinship for another human being. This stunning lack of concern for our fellow citizens permeates and festers in the cyber world, especially on social media, and is spilling over into the real world. We are in increasingly dangerous territory\u2014we are at risk of undermining the very traits that make us human in the first place. More than two decades ago, journalist Daniel Goleman wrote about the importance of empathy in his bestselling book Emotional Intelligence. When he argued that genuine intelligence is a mixture of IQ and what we've come to call EQ, or emotional intelligence, he changed our thinking about what makes someone truly intelligent. EQ is the ability to understand and control our emotions and read and respond appropriately to the emotional states of others. EQ, rather than IQ, is the determining factor predicting success in business, personal relationships, and even our health outcomes. Obviously, you can't experience emotional intelligence without feeling, without emotion. But when we are in cyberspace, 'feelings' don't come into play because our computers can't see or sense them: When we enter the virtual world, we leave our EQ behind. Inadvertently, we have plunged ourselves headfirst into a world that neither recognizes emotion nor allows us to express emotion to one another, a world that short-circuits an essential dimension of human intelligence. And today, we are suffering the consequences of our emotion-blind interactions.We are in increasingly dangerous territory\u2014 we are at risk of undermining the very traits that make us human in the first place.Computers are 'smart' in that they were designed with an abundance of cognitive intelligence, or IQ. But they are totally lacking in EQ. Traditional computers are emotion blind: They don't recognize or respond to emotion at all. Around twenty years ago, a handful of computer scientists\u2014I was one of them\u2014recognized that as computers became more deeply embedded in our lives, we would need them to have more than computational smarts; we'd need them to have people smarts. Without this, we run the risk that our dependence on our 'smart' technology will siphon off the very intelligence and capabilities that distinguish human beings from our machines. If we continue on this path of emotion blind technology, we run the risk of losing our social skills in the real world. We will forget how to be compassionate and empathetic to one another. THE NEW REALITYI am cofounder and CEO of a Boston-based artificial intelligence company, a pioneer in Emotion AI, a branch of computer science dedicated to bringing emotional intelligence to the digital world. My goal is not to build emotive computers, but to enable human beings to retain our humanity when we are in the cyber world\u2014to humanize technology before it dehumanizes us. In striving to become the 'expert' I needed to be in human emotion in order to teach machines about emotion, I found myself turning the spotlight on my own emotional life. This was an even more daunting process than writing code for computers; it forced me to confront my own reticence to share my innermost feelings, indeed, my own reluctance to recognize and act on my own feelings. Ultimately, decoding myself\u2014learning to express my own emotions and act on them\u2014was the biggest challenge of all. Expert as I have become on the subject, I feel that I am very much a work in progress myself. To me, my work and my personal story are inseparable; each flows into the other. I am a rarity in the tech world: a woman in charge\u2014a brown-skinned computer scientist at that\u2014in a field that is still very male and very white. I was raised in the Middle East is a male-dominated culture that is still figuring out the role of women in a world that is changing with breathtaking speed. In both these cultures\u2014tech and the Muslim Middle East\u2014women have been excluded or restricted from positions of power. I've had to maneuver both cultures to achieve what I have. Bridging the divide between people is how we gain empathy, and that is how we build strong, emotionally intact people and a strong, emotionally intact world. That is the core of what I do, whether in the real world or the cyber one. I am also passionate that people understand what AI is, and how it's going to impact their lives. The world, your world, is about to change. Given how AI is becoming ubiquitous, and the potential impact it has on all our lives, it's critical that we as a society take an active role in how this AI is designed, developed, and deployed. By this year, according to various industry reports, there will be between four and six connected devices for every human being on the planet. And our computers will become even more embedded in our lives. This is the new reality. I am not suggesting that face-to-face relationships are not still important\u2014just the opposite. Yes, it's unacceptable to sit at dinner texting instead of engaging in real conversation with the people around you, but the reality is that much of your interpersonal interactions today are conducted in the cyber world, and that's not going to change. (I'm a pragmatist.) So the solution is not to turn back the clock, shut down our devices, and go back to life as it was before our computers. We depend too much on technology to give it up. And doing so would be a terrible mistake. We need our technology more than ever. But we need to make it smarter, better, and more humane. And fortunately, we now have the tools to do this. An Emotion AI world is a human-centric world, one where our technology has our backs and helps us become healthier, happier, and more empathetic individuals: technologies such as Google Glass, equipped with 'emotion decoders' that help autisitc kids better interact socially with others; semi-autonomous care that assume control of the wheel when we're too angry, distracted, or tired to drive safely. Preventing millions of accidents each year; emotion-aware devices (from smartwatches and smartphones to smart refrigerators) able to detect mental and physical ailments years before their onset; empathetic virtual assistants that can track your mood and offer timely guidance and support; human resources emotion analytic tools that can enable an HR recruiter to match the right person more precisely to the right job or team and eliminate much of the unconscious bias that occurs in hiring; and an intelligent learning system that can detect the level of engagement of a student and tailor its approach accordingly.We need our technology more than ever. But we need to make it smarter, better, and more humane.The potential for Emotion AI is breathtaking, but I am not naive: When you have computers with the capacity to recognize and record the emotional states of users, of course privacy is of major concern. Emotion AI should\u2014must\u2014be employed only with the full knowledge and consent of the user, who should be able to opt out at any time. Emotion AI will know a lot about us: our emotional states, moods, and interactions. In the wrong hands, this information can be very damaging. That is why it is so essential for the public to be aware of what this technology is, how and where data is being collected, and to have a say in how it is being used. It is also imperative that AI technology be developed with all human beings in mind, that it be inclusive. Our software must reflect the real world, not just the world of an elite. Much of my research has been devoted to obtaining data from a diverse population, representing all ages, genders, ethnicities, and geographical areas. If our AI fails to do this, we will be creating a new form of discrimination that will be very hard to undo, and as such technology propels us forward, we run the risk of leaving behind whole sectors of our population, and that would be disastrous for us all. HUMAN BEFORE ARTIFICIALAs AI becomes mainstream and ubiquitous, AI systems that are designed to engage with humans will have a lot of data on you\u2014personal data about who you are, your preferences, your actions and your quirks. We live in a society where data is being collected on all of us, all the time. Sometimes it's obvious; sometimes not. Sometimes it's for our benefit; sometimes not. As the CEO of an AI company, I understand that having access to so much data comes with a great deal of responsibility: How do we ensure the ethical development and deployment of AI? My team and I offer a positive vision for AI, but we're not naive. We understand that the potential for abuse, especially the careless management of data, is very real and it is happening right now, but companies and governments. Privacy advocates have long voiced concerns over how data is collected by Big Tech, and how it can be sold or hacked, or can inadvertently end up in places where it doesn't belong. Technology companies have a long history of acting first and asking for forgiveness later. Lately, the public is not so forgiving. But let's face it, every time we search the Internet, shop, or download a book or video, we are being watched. Like it or not, a lot of people whom we don't know know an awful lot about us and our preferences. Stalking you online while you surf your favorite stores to learn your brand preferences (without your permission) may be an infringement of your privacy, but it pales in comparison to how totalitarian regimes have weaponized AI against entire groups of people. Totalitarian regimes ignore the public because they can. But in a global marketplace, the 'public' isn't just your own citizens. You have to consider the citizens of the world. We can build a better AI on our strengths and ethical standards, one that empowers individuals. At the same time, we can reform Big Tech and build a more humanistic AI for the future. AI is not evil. The technology itself is neutral, but it may be used by people with nefarious purposes. We (software developers) have a responsibility to be highly selective about whom we allow to use our technology, and how it will be used. This is where consumers can flex their muscles: Do you want to buy a product from a company that allows its AI to be used to spy of ethnic minorities, as it is used in China? Consumers have power that they think to control abuse in this sector. They just haven't had the tools to take action yet. Big Tech companies are beginning to recognize that if they don't take action to prevent abuses, local and federal governments will. Certainly, some regulation is required. But these issues are so complex, and the technology moving so quickly, that the industry itself has to step in and take a proactive role in designing a strategy that doesn't inhibit progress, but also doesn't achieve it at the cost of privacy. It is one reason my company, Affectiva, is part of a Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (PAI), and tech industry consortium established to 'study and formulate best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's understanding of AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion and engagement about AI and its influence on people and society.' Its eighty-plus members from more than thirteen countries include tech giants as well as other voices, like the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, and the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute. It's why we started out annual Emotion AI Summit with the goal of building an ecosystem of ethicists, academics, and AI innovators and practitioners across industries to take action. As a society, we are just starting to have a conversation about the role of AI in our lives, and how to use it ethically and fairly for the betterment of humanity. We can't let the presence of some bad players exploiting this technology thwart the ability of the good players to create tools and services that are helpful to society. We have to establish standards, and those who cross the line, either directly or indirectly (by licensing technologies to bad players), need to know that the tables have turned: AI developers, consumers, and different levels of government are now tracking them and will penalize companies that don't conform to basic human standards. After all, shouldn't we put the human before artificial? </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CEOR12820515876045592372587610004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CEOR-128205</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRB-DGH1-F03R-N3H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2297\"/><timeReceived>1:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Porchlight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

Normally, I avoid momentum stocks like the plague when earnings or margins disappoint and a stock tanks. This principle made total sense with, say, Netflix or Twitter. However, I violated my own principle in the case of Facebook for multiple reasons.</p><p>One, the shares fell 23 per cent from their 217 pre-earnings peak. Two, valuations are far too cheap relative to 30 per cent revenue growth prospects at only 17 times earnings ex-cash. Three, these valuation metrics simply do not capture the billion active user monetisation engines that are Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. Four, the revenue miss was due to the cost of data privacy regulatory compliance, Europe's GDPR restrictions on video sharing and investments in video context, artificial intelligence and global growth.</p><p>Five, Facebook is a money-making machine on capitulation selling, as the world learnt in March and last week. The ecosystem of fund managers and the mathematics of market stress relative to earnings make this happen. Six, Facebook's guidance pattern is to underplay revenue acceleration, then watch valuations readjust when good news hit the tape, as it will in the third quarter. Seven, Facebook trades at almost a 28 per cent valuation discount to Google/Alphabet despite higher operating margins, revenue growth and messaging monetisation. Last week's price action only reinforced my conviction that Facebook is undervalued relative to the S&amp;P 500 index and will meet my near term target of 200.</p><p>I am far less bullish on Twitter, despite its public execution on the Nasdaq. Twitter's revenue growth and profits will be hit by the sheer cost of running its platform, given the exponential rise in the salaries of software engineers in Silicon Valley and acquisition of video content. Unlike Facebook, Twitter's valuation is a joke (the shares are 32 as I write) at 50 times forward - I repeat forward - GAAP earnings. After all, Facebook's revenue growth has been almost double Twitter, which trades at a 60 per cent premium to Google despite a similar revenue rate. Facebook has 2.3 billion active user worldwide and Twitter is simply not positioned for growth or in the same global scale league as Facebook and Google. So I cannot smoke a 50 times forward valuation multiple in my philosopher's pipe, despite Jack Dorsey's hirsute reassurances.</p><p>I expect Twitter to lose at least 30 per cent of its value in the next six months, making it a classic short in a pair trade with Facebook. Who says Mr Market rationally prices social media shares (or any other asset for that matter!). Twitter still needs to deliver credible user growth/engagement data and the strategy for video monetisation that will not bankrupt the company. This is not a blip from the fake account purge but a far deeper strategic and structural malaise.</p><p>Apple's trillion-dollar valuation was a seminal \"era-defining\" moment, such as the doomed Time Warner-AOL merger deal in 1999, the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the UK Brexit vote and Trump's election in 2016. However, the Federal Reserve's shift in language means much higher interest rates in the next two years, despite the mediocre July payrolls data.</p><p>This will have a seismic impact on the valuation of every asset in the world, including houses, used cars, home mortgages and auto loans even here in Dubai. Despite the shocks in Netflix and Facebook, technology is a \"crowded trade\", even a mini-speculative mania. This rise of passive investing makes indices like the Nasdaq or even the S&amp;P 500 hostage to the fate of a half-dozen stocks, as the FANG phenomenon proves. Valuations are no longer cheap for most large cap tech companies at a time when higher interest rates will hit high valuation multiples. It is ominous that the tsunami of inflows on tech exchange traded funds may well have peaked. This is probably a natural reaction to higher rates and a peak in earnings valuations.</p><p>With the US Dollar index again at 95 and a hawkish Powell Fed, the higher US dollar will definitely hit the EPS growth of Big Tech. At a time when Microsoft trades at a market cap of $830 billion, I can easily envisage King Dollar and a 3 per cent Fed Funds rate finally make a Nasdaq market meltdown highly probable. It is, after all, better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.</p><p>The writer is a global equities strategist and fund manager.

Most of the strong global brands  and strongest high tech businesses  remain American, and firms like Apple and Netflix will profit greatly.</p><p> The recent run up in stocks has been driven most fundamentally by strong profits growth in the second and third quarters. The closely watched S&amp;P 500 Index, which comprises about 80 percent of U.S. publicly traded companies, has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 25. That key indicator of whether stocks are too high or too low is about the same as a year ago and still in line with its 25-year average.</p><p> Analysts are forecasting earnings growth exceeding 10 percent over the next three quarters. That puts the forward the price-earnings (P-E) ratio at only 18 and makes another jump in stock prices wholly possible if investors continue their confidence in the Trump Administration's commitment to pro-growth tax and regulatory reforms.</p><p> Importantly, inflation remains in check  the recent surge in gasoline prices is receding. Hence, the Federal Reserve will only raise interest rates slowly and the return on investments in Treasuries, CDs and other fixed income investments will remain quite low.</p><p> Even with somewhat higher interest rates, the P-E at 25 implies a rate of return on stockholder invested capital of 4 percent on shareholder equity. Investors can't get anywhere near that on long-term Treasuries or CDs.</p><p> Adding in expected earnings growth, the returns on stocks should be much higher. Over the last 25 years, the return on the S&amp;P 500 has averaged 11 percent but only about 3 percent on long-term Treasuries.</p><p> At the same time, sustainable long-term P-E ratios appear to be rising.</p><p> In this century, new value creation is premised much more on intellectual property  for example, computer apps that create companies like Lyft and artificial intelligence that power the robotics revolution  and less on hard assets  in particular, industrial buildings and factory equipment. This trend greatly reduces the amount of financial capital businesses must reinvest or raise to introduce new and better products  the foundations of higher earnings and American wealth.</p><p> Consider that Google was launched with only $25 million in 1999 and grew into a $23 billion enterprise at its initial public offering five years later  that story repeated at ventures like Facebook, Snapchat and many others.</p><p> Similarly, as industrial era enterprises like Ford and IBM rely more on software to create value in products sold  for example, driverless vehicles and Watson  and innovations like 3D printers and flexible robots make machinery investments more versatile and productive, the demand for private capital to finance expensive purchases of physical assets becomes more limited.</p><p> This is an important reason why established companies are flush with cash  they simply need to spend less on new buildings and hardware to improve productivity, expand product offerings and launch new ventures.</p><p> Lower capital requirements coupled with an abundance of investable funds are pushing down the rate of return needed to attract new capital into business ventures. In turn, that pushes up the P-E ratios equity markets can sustain.</p><p> For stocks overall, a long term P-E ratio of 35 now seems reasonable if the Trump administration can keep the business environment positive with responsible tax cuts and regulatory reforms.</p><p> My advice for ordinary investors remains the same. Don't try to pick stocks or time the market  broadly diversify and invest for the long term.</p><p> Those nearing retirement should keep about half their money in fixed income vehicles with maturities of less than three to five years, and invest in a low cost S&amp;P 500 index fund offered by USAA or a similar service. And perhaps an international index fund to smooth returns  sometimes U.S. equities do better while other times foreign stocks lead.</p><p> If you're younger, put aside some cash for emergencies or upcoming commitments like college tuition and invest a reasonable amount each month in a similar basket of equities, follow that discipline through thick and thin, and you'll do well.</p><p> \u2022\u00a0 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-167CB74F0D6DAEE0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PTH-X3S1-JBCN-41VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>27 October 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001561</classCode><className>SHAREHOLDERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E</classCode><className>Shareholders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001494</classCode><className>RETURN ON INVESTMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001757</classCode><className>TREASURY SECURITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000913</classCode><className>INFLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001242</classCode><className>OIL &amp;

This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>I'm Bret Baier reporting tonight from the White House where the Trump administration continues to push back on impeachment narratives coming from Capitol Hill and from the left as the top polling Democrat prepares to officially enter the race.</p><p>But first despite the discord here in Washington post-Mueller report, the markets have taken that report in stride.  And tonight your 401(k) is probably a lot healthier than it has been in a while.</p><p>A big day on Wall Street as the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at record highs, recovering all the ground they lost in nose dive late last year.  The Dow had a strong performance today as well netting 145 closing in on its own record close.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 26.  The NASDAQ surged 106.</p><p>The market is buoyed by better-than-expected numbers from a number of companies today.</p><p>Let's get some analysis from Susan Li of the Fox Business Network.  She joins us from New York.  Good evening -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.</p><p>The bull market continues in 2019, surprising many that thought it was coming to an end especially after a dismal December.  The broader index -- the S&amp;P 500 surpassing its last record high struck in September last year.  It is also the 81st record under President Trump.  The NASDAQ hitting its 96th new record in this administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  He ended the war on business.  He's ended the war on success.  He believes strongly that if you do well and succeed you should be rewarded, not punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI:  What has been powering the rally?  The Federal Reserve's signaling that the Central Bank is not likely to raise interest rates this year.  Also signs that the U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and companies earnings that continue to defy gravity.  And that is despite bears' (ph) calls for a drop in corporate profits the first three months of the year.</p><p>Big tech has been one of the most favorite trade so far with big gains for Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft.  Virtually every sector has seen an advance with stocks big and small joining in on the rally.</p><p>A strong stock market and a growing U.S. economy that the President doesn't think gets enough media attention.  President Trump tweeting, \"In the old days if you are president and you had a good economy you are basically immune from criticism.\"</p><p>Now this week is another big test with tech giants Facebook and Microsoft reporting results tomorrow and first quarter GDP expected on Friday.  That is a big one, economist forecasting somewhere between 1.5 percent to maybe 2.5 percent growth -- a strong bounce back after a government shutdown to start off the year -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Susan Li in New York.  Susan,  thanks.</p><p>President Trump met with the CEO of Twitter here at the White House today.  The social media site has been a frequent target of the President's wrath but is also a primary communication tool for him.  And case in point, he just tweeted about the meeting last hour.  \"Great meeting this afternoon at the White House with @Jack from @Twitter.  Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform and the world of social media in general.  Look forward to keeping an open dialogue.\"  As you heard Susan mention Twitter was up nearly 16 percent today on the markets because of a positive earnings report.</p><p>Meantime one of the President's senior is communicating his thoughts about the ramifications of the Mueller report.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts begins there here on the north lawn.  Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, good evening to you.</p><p>It was one of those rare moments where we got to hear the first son-in-law Jared Kushner speak at length.  It was at the Time 100 Forum where Kushner had plenty to say about the Mueller report and the path that Congress is now taking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW:  All these people thought Trump was going to lose.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Weighing in for the first time on the Mueller report, Jared Kushner downplayed Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election insisting the real damage was done by the ensuing investigation.</p><p>KUSHNER:  You look at, you know, what Russia did, you know, buying some Facebook ads and tried to (INAUDIBLE) and do it.  And it's a terrible thing.  But I think the investigations and all the speculation that has happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Kushner said when Mueller came calling he was the first one to raise his hand to cooperate.  Spending hours with the special counsel, hours more in congressional committees and he fully embraced at least one of Mueller's findings.</p><p>KUSHNER:  The one thing the Mueller report was very conclusive on is there was absolutely no coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign.  And everything that the President has been saying, everything that I've been saying for two years has now been fully authenticated.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But Democrats want to know a lot more about the other part of the Mueller report -- presidential efforts to thwart the investigation.  The White House is deliberating whether to allow former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 21st.  The former chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, believes McGahn will testify with conditions.</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  I expect him to come, but I expect him to insist on having people behind him that can advise him as to when to answer a question and when a privilege might be appropriate.</p><p>ROBERTS:  The White House has already advised one former staffer to ignore a congressional subpoena.  Carl Kline, the former chief of White House personnel security was told not to show up for his scheduled deposition to the House Oversight Committee today.  Committee chairman Elijah Cummings said he will take a vote to hold Kline in contempt.</p><p>Following the lead of Senator Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate is all in on impeachment.  Senator Kamala Harris telling a town hall that Congress needs to act.</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe that we need to get rid of this president.  That this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice.  I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But at the same Time 100 forum where Kushner spoke, President Trump's opponent from 2016 took a more measured approach to the idea of impeachment.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  You don't put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table and say you're going to get there no matter what which is just what happened in '99.</p><p>Instead you say we are going to proceed with the seriousness that this demands.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS:  And Hillary Clinton knows all too well what happens when Congress barrels down that road to impeachment unimpeded.  But at the same time as all these congressional investigations are heating up President Trump will have a chance to get out of Washington for a while.</p><p>Just days after he returns from a trip to Japan to meet with the new emperor he will head off to the U.K. to meet with the Queen then cross the channel into Normandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  And he'll have a decision -- how much to fight, how much not to fight Congress.</p><p>ROBERTS:  I have a feeling they're going to fight all -- most if not all of these subpoenas.  I think the Kline subpoena fight is a good indication of which way they are going.</p><p>BAIER:  All right.  John -- thank you.</p><p>Well, senior officials at the Treasury Department are still trying to determine if a request for the President's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee is legal.  The Department missed today's deadline to turn over six years of the President's records.  The Treasury says it is waiting on the Justice Department to issue a report on the legality.  That conclusion will not be given to Treasury until May 6th.  The Treasury Secretary insisting the law does not allow Congress to set a deadline for the response.</p><p>Meantime a new alarm bells are sounding in Washington tonight over the long-term viability of the nation's bedrock social safety net programs for older Americans.  We first told you last night about a new government report stating that Medicare will become insolvent in just seven years if nothing is done.  And trustees write that Social Security is in trouble too, following close behind on insolvency.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Kevin Corke looks at where we are and what it means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  The Medicare trustees reported that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>The 2019 status of the Social Security and Medicare programs paints an alarming picture of the future of two of America's most indispensable entitlement programs.</p><p>VERMA:  We need to change the trajectory of health care cost growth to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>CORKE:  The report summarizes that at current projections Medicare's Hospital Insurance Fund will only be able to afford 89 percent of its total cost in just seven years.  And that Social Security program costs are likely to exceed total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982.</p><p>While Medicare and specifically Medicare for all have been the subject of a fierce political debate among Democrats this year, Trump administration officials say the program is also increasingly vulnerable.  With Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar writing in a statement that instead of trying to expand Medicare into quote, \"a universal entitlement that even covers wealthy Americans of working age, we need to fulfill Medicare's promise to our seniors.\"</p><p>SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The American people want and we are going to deliver a Medicare for all single-payer system.</p><p>CORKE:  Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders headlines a large field of 2020 Democrat contenders who back some form of Medicare for all with Sanders specifically advocating a single-payer system --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're going to will hurt your Social Security so badly.</p><p>CORKE:  According to the report the news is equally bleak for Social Security.  It forecast that its funds could be depleted by 2035 and that could lead to reductions in payouts to retirees and other beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Bret -- the real concern at Social Security offices like the one behind me is that with so many baby boomers nearing retirement age and soon to be drawing off the system, it is paramount that something be done to address the shortfall.</p><p>For its part the White House is asking congressional lawmakers to do something about it sooner rather than later -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Now to politics.  Former vice president Joe Biden will formally declare his candidacy for the top job Thursday.  That is a departure from the earlier plan of a Wednesday rollout and it comes as most polls indicate Biden leads the field of which he's not yet an official member.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy tells us where things stand right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long time politician who loves quoting Irish poets.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, I can't let a comment go by without quoting an Irish poet.</p><p>DOOCY:  The third time is a charm.  Joe Biden will announce another White House campaign with an online video Thursday, then a Pittsburgh rally Monday.  The 2020 bid follows a campaign in 1988 cut short by a plagiarism scandal and a campaign in 2008 that ended after the Iowa caucus.</p><p>BIDEN:  And let me make something clear to you, I ain't going away.</p><p>DOOCY:  Now the 76-year-old is set to become 2020's 20th candidate.</p><p>HARRIS:  Come on in.  The water is warm -- Joe.</p><p>DOOCY:  Kamala Harris is also pitching executive action on guns.</p><p>HARRIS:  Upon being elected I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.  And if they fail to do it then I will take executive action.</p><p>DOOCY:  So what has changed since Biden was Barack Obama's vice president when days after the Boston marathon bombing he condemned the culprit.</p><p>BIDEN:  Two, twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis here in Boston.</p><p>DOOCY:  Now, the Democratic front runner among declared candidates believes the surviving Boston bomber should be able to vote from jail.</p><p>SANDERS:  The right to vote is inherent to our democracy.  Yes, even for terrible people.</p><p>DOOCY:  One thing Biden has going for him -- name recognition.  Millions already know his story.</p><p>Amy Klobuchar isn't quite there yet.</p><p>SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have won every single congressional district in my state including Michelle Bachmann's.  That is when you guys are supposed to cheer, ok.</p><p>DOOCY:  One challenge for Biden maybe be generational.  He's more than twice the age of surging South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg who just updated his Web site with policy positions but approached accusations that he has pushed a hate hoax by attacking Mike Pence with caution.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm not a master fisherman but I know bait when I see it and I'm not going to take it.</p><p>DOOCY:  Joe Biden will bring less of a filter even when facing controversy.</p><p>BIDEN:  By the way, he gave me permission to touch him, all right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  As Biden's unwanted touching scandal grew Barack Obama never publicly defended him and now as Biden reportedly plans to roll out a long list of high-profile endorsements, it is not clear Obama will be one of them -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Peter -- thank you.</p><p>We are happy to announce Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg will appear on a Fox News town hall meeting next month.  The South Bend, Indiana mayor will join us from Claremont, New Hampshire Sunday May 19th at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.  Chris Wallace will moderate that.</p><p>We will also host Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar Wednesday May 8th from Milwaukee.  That airs at 6:30 p.m.  Martha MacCallum and I will moderate that town hall.</p><p>Now to the Republicans and the possibility of a second primary challenger to President Trump.  He is Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and he showed up today at a perfect spot to get the word out that he may be considering a run.</p><p>Correspondent Kristin Fisher shows us tonight from Manchester, New Hampshire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN (R), MARYLAND:  I just thought that April would be a beautiful time to visit New Hampshire.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maryland Governor Larry Logan played coy about his intentions in attending a must stop event for presidential candidates in the first primary state.  But over politics and eggs, the governor made clear he is seriously considering challenging President Trump.</p><p>HOGAN:  I'm not interested in just running to hurt the President, bruise the President.  I'm out here talking about things that I think are important.  I care about the future of my party.</p><p>FISHER:  But the Republican National Committee does not care for any Republican trying to take down President Trump including former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld who officially entered the race last week.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.  I mean the President has 93 percent approval in our party.</p><p>FISHER:  In January the Republican National Committee passed a resolution of undivided support for President Trump effectively merging the party and his reelection team into a single unit.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes.  I think this goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the President.  I mean I think it was wrong what the DNC did but this is much worse.</p><p>FISHER:  Today Hogan accused President Trump of trying to commit a crime, obstruction of justice.  And he slammed other Republicans for being too afraid to speak out.</p><p>Governor Weld agrees.</p><p>BILL WELD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They are all petrified of the President because they know he can't control his emotions and he's given to temper tantrums and being vindictive.</p><p>FISHER:  Hogan is aware that after today he could become President Trump's next target.  But Hogan believes he is uniquely qualified to sustain that kind of attack.</p><p>HOGAN:  I battled cancer for 18 months.  I can probably take him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER:  But could he upend more than a century of history.  The last time a primary challenger defeated a sitting president was in 1884 -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Kristin Fisher in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Kristin -- thanks.</p><p>The fate of a proposed citizenship question on next year's census is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Justices they heard arguments today right now.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @NIGHT\" Shannon Bream tells us what was said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE HO, ACLU VOTING RIGHTS PROJECT:  It is not about a line on a form.  It is about whether or not everyone in America counts.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:  But therein lies the problem the nine justices must untangle.  Whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross overstepped his authority by adding a citizenship question to the 2020 sentence.</p><p>Critics of the move say it will discourage people from completing the forms predicting it will lead to an undercount of primarily minority populations.  Today several of the liberal-leaning justices said the administration can get the information it is seeking from other government databases.</p><p>Of Ross' decision Justice Sotomayor said, quote, \"This seems like he thought of something, I want to add a citizenship question.\"  Adding, \"This is a solution in search of a problem.  I've got to find a problem that fits what I want to do.\"</p><p>But a number of the more conservative justices noted that the citizenship question has been included on various census forms nearly uniformly between 1820 and 1950.  And in a more limited way since then.</p><p>Justice Kavanaugh noting that the statute passed by Congress gives the Commerce Secretary enormous discretion in putting together the census form.  Asked why if Congress objects it hasn't already outlawed the question.  Quote, \"Why doesn't Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?\"</p><p>Opponents traced the entire debate back to the issue of immigration and claimed that the administration's sole purpose in asking about citizenship is to silence people in the U.S. illegally.  The administration says the President's priorities are both legal and fair.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We want to know who's in this country.  And I think as a sovereign nation we have that right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a decision from the court is due by late June and time is of the essence.  The census forms, whether they contain the citizenship question or not will head to the printing process this summer -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Shannon -- thank you.  See you at 11:00 p.m. tonight.</p><p>Up next, ISIS claims responsibility for the Easter Sunday massacre on Christians in Sri Lanka.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 25 in Boston where a Florida judge has ordered a video police say shows New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft paying for sex not be released publicly for now.  The judge accepted arguments by Kraft's attorneys that releasing the video could harm chances for a fair trial.  He says it should not be handed to the media as a public record until the jury is seated, a plea agreement is reached or the state drops the case.</p><p>And this is a live look at Detroit from Fox 2.

The man in charge of the restoration of the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral says he has hired professional mountain climbers to install temporary tarps over the building to offset potential rain damage.

Today's decision is being criticized by human rights advocates around the world.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We will be right back to the White House.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  You're looking live there at the White House lawn.  Alex Jones, the controversial host, Trump supporter, out there with a bullhorn, and that's what you heard earlier.  Some people out there as well, saying they support President Trump but they don't support Twitter.  President Trump meeting with the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, here at the White House today.  You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background.  Thought we'd show you what was happening.</p><p>In the meantime, a new legal challenge for embattled actor Jussie Smollett tonight.  Two of the men involved in what police say was a faked hate crime attacker are now throwing rhetorical punches at Smollett's lawyers.  Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin has details tonight from this story that is ever-changing in Chicago.  Good evening, Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  One way or the other we might still see actor Jussie Smollett in a real-life courtroom drama.  He is facing a lawsuit from the city of Chicago, and he may very well be called as a witness in the federal lawsuit that was filed today.</p><p>However, the actor was not named as a defendant.  The suit does say the attack was a hoax conceived and directed by Jussie Smollett right down to the use of a noose, bleach, and shouts that this is MAGA correspondent from the attackers.  The lawsuit is directed as his high-powered legal team, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian.  It claims after charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett, Geragos and Glandian did the rounds on news programs and podcasts.  Lawyers for the Osundairo brothers say Geragos and Glandian repeatedly made false, reprehensible, and damaging statements.  The brothers claim their reputation and personal training business were damaged.  They also suffered emotional distress.</p><p>Today attorney Gloria Schmidt said the two wannabe actors followed the direction of a successful actor, and now they want to clear their names.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLORIA SCHMIDT, OSUNDAIRO BROTHERS ATTORNEY:  They were asked to do something by a friend who they trusted, and at the end of the day that friend betrayed their trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN:  Geragos and Glandian hit back.  Part of their statement reads, \"This so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated.\" Geragos says the suit will be thrown out, it lacks legal footing.  The brothers are seeking an unspecified amount of money and legal costs.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Mike Tobin in Chicago.  We'll follow this.  Mike, thanks.</p><p>Meantime, Mexico is trying to show the U.S. it is getting more serious about stopping Central American migrants from reaching the southern border of the U.S.  Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt looks at a major move that took place Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Migrants fought back with sticks against what appeared to be a concerted effort by Mexican authorities to send a signal they will no longer be so accommodating to the thousands coming from Central America and heading to the U.S. border.  It was clearly a well-planned operation with police officers, according to A.P. reporters on scene, suggesting a group of hundreds of migrants take a break in the shade, as others from the approximately 3,000 strong caravan moved on.  Then as the trailing group rested, the Mexican authorities moved in.  Large numbers of officers grabbing men, women, and children, taking them away to waiting buses.  More than 350 were picked up in total according to Mexico's National Migration Institute, which blamed the violence on a small group of aggressive migrants.  Journalists traveling with a caravans have also reportedly that migrants are getting a far less hospitable welcome in the Mexican towns they travel through than was the case several months ago.</p><p>KEVIN MCALEENAN, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  Any solution we're going to have to reduce this flow is going to rely on Mexican authorities to take a stronger action, frankly, against people that are exploiting migrants.</p><p>HUNT:  Customs and Border Protection officials also shared this video with FOX News today which they say was shot on the Arizona-Mexico border on Saturday, and shows heavily armed smugglers escorting a Guatemalan woman and boy into the U.S.  CBP says it is concerned to see those sort of weapons now being used by human smugglers right on the border.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNT:  The woman and her son were quickly detained by CBP agents.  The armed smugglers are still at large somewhere in Mexico.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>Joe Biden pushes back his entry into the 2020 race by a day, and President Trump may be getting another Republican challenger.  We'll talk about it all and the 2020 election when the panel joins me after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE:  The impeachment proceedings are up to the House.  They are going to have to make that decision.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think he has made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment.  I'm also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  Every person in the Senate and the House, they should take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I want to see about that investigation.  We'll see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  \"Impeachment\" the word of the day for the town hall with the 2020 candidates, as you look at a list, a ever-growing of people getting into the 2020 race.  It is a lot easier, it seems, for them to say, sure, go ahead and impeach President Trump, than it is for House Democrats to get to that conclusion and the logistical hurdles ahead.</p><p>As you look at the polls new out today, Monmouth poll, has Joe Biden is in the lead and you see Bernie Sanders in second.  Pete Buttigieg, they mayor, look at that, less that one percent to eight percent just in a short time.  And then if you look at Iowa, obviously the first stop the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden also leading there, the margin a little bit smaller, and Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in third.</p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\"  Jonah, we've had this kind of launch, non-launch for Joe Biden.  He was going to go Wednesday, now it's Thursday.  We don't have a lot of details on what it looks like, but he's clearly still leading in some of these big pools.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\":  He is.  And I think he is well-positioned.  I don't usually give a lot advice to Democrats, but if I were him, I would come out, I would announce and immediately take dead aim at Bernie Sanders and say this is a two-person race.  I'm the grown up.  I'm a liberal, but I'm not a socialist.  The party will go down in flames if we pursue Bernie's path.  It will make everybody else look small.  He is basically the only guy in a position who can do that.</p><p>And I think that one of the things we see is that a lot of the Democratic primary people, they think that basically Democratic Twitter is the actual Democratic electorate, and it's not.  And he is one of the only people who is positioned to actually reach out to the traditional Democratic voter.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, you do wonder, though, about the launch or decision to launch and what transpired there.  All we are told is that something will happen Thursday, a video launch, and then there's a Monday event in Pittsburgh.  I don't know what happens between Thursday and Monday, but it's interesting.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Originally it was supposed to be Wednesday, tomorrow, as you know.  And one of the reasons they delayed it, I'm being told, is Charlottesville.  A lot of people thought at first that might be a good place for the former vice president to announce, but then there was some kickback, people felt it was disrespectful, they decided not to do it, and that delayed them some.</p><p>There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track.  But I and other Democrats are not worried yet.  He is still leading in almost every poll, and he hasn't yet announced.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, a lot of that has to do with name recognition, a lot of that has to do with eight years as vice president, and you wonder how Joe Biden is going to compete with a pretty energetic and obviously voluminous candidate spread on the Democratic side.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years.  He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time.  And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything.</p><p>And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington.  And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much.  And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them.  The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess.</p><p>BAIER:  It doesn't seem like President Trump has settled on a nickname yet.  He had one percent Joe for past races, then he had sleepy Joe.  We don't know where he will end up.</p><p>Jonah, voting rights for prisoners came up last night in the town halls and seemed to be a little bit of a separation.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should people convicted of sexual assault, the Boston Marathon bomber, should they be able to vote?</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  While incarcerated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do believe that even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think we should have that conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Is this an issue that Iowa and New Hampshire cares about?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  It is a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.  Buttigieg gave the exact right answer, and Bernie Sanders' position I find utterly baffling.  Look, when you go to this thing called prison, you have lots of rights that are curtailed.  The freedom of assembly, freedom of speech all sorts of things.  One of the others ones happens to be freedom to vote.  It is another thing entirely when you pay back your debt to society about whether or not you should have your voting rights restored.  But the idea that Bernie Sanders is getting out like free candy these Willie Horton type issues where he wants the worst terrorists in America to be able to vote, it's bizarre to me.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it's one thing to be talking about Medicare for all and the details of that and then the Green New Deal and how you're going to pay for it, but it seems that that, prisoners voting, Electoral College, seem on the outskirts.</p><p>MARSHALL:  Definitely.  In dark corners, if you will, Democrats like myself are saying, why are they even making this an issue?  Mayor Pete got it right.  When somebody commits a crime, and I think most Democrats feel this way, they lose their rights as a free individual.  Now, when they get out of prison, if they get those rights restored that's a whole other conversation.  We've seen that.  There are people left and right that can agree to that.  And this is a can of worms that a Democrat doesn't need to open because we have so many other areas.  The only good thing about this, Bret, is this is one area where they all did not agree on this issue.</p><p>BAIER:  All right, finally, you have William Weld on the Republican side throwing his name in the hat, an uphill battle obviously.  Now you have potentially the Maryland governor.  Take a listen to Larry Hogan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN, (R) MARYLAND:  I think it goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the president.  I think it was wrong what the DNC did, but this is much worse.</p><p>To change the rules and to insist 100 percent royalty to the dear leader, it just didn't sound very much like the Republican Party that I grew up in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, you don't go to politics in New Hampshire unless you are really thinking about it.</p><p>HURT:  I think that is right.  And by the way, I think it is a great thing.  I think anybody wants to get in and stir the pot is great.  But the bottom line remains, the president remains one of the most popular Republicans among Republicans in recent times, and he's going to be the nominee.  With Bernie Sanders, I'm calling it the 50-state strategy to make sure that even Massachusetts votes for Republicans.  With crazy ideas like letting the Boston Marathon bomber's vote, a guy like President Trump is in a good position I think to win reelection.</p><p>BAIER:  By the way, Alex Jones agrees with you behind the gate here with his microphone.  Panel, stand by.  Next up, a grim outlook for Medicare and Social Security.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  Health care spending in America is on an unsustainable path.  The Medicare Trustees reported that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you take Social Security, it's 25 percent of the federal budget, and it's growing faster than the GDP.  You add in Medicare and Medicaid and now you're up to about 55 percent, 55 percent of the entire federal budget.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  We saw some disturbing numbers from the Trustees report.  As you heard Medicare seven years from now depleted in the hospital insurance pond.  That happens then Medicare Part A will only be able to cover 89 percent of the cost for hospital stays and related services, and that will go down to 77 percent in 2046.  On Social Security, total costs projected to exceed its total income including interests for the first time since 1982.  The bottom line is something has to be done to save these programs if we are going to.  We are back with a panel.  Charlie?</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  This is a slow-rolling catastrophe, and it's not something that we haven't known for a long time.  Obviously, people like Paul Ryan have been talking about it for a long time.  President Trump obviously ran in 2016 vowing not to touch these programs.  Obviously, that was a smart move back then, but the fact remains that they are going consultants and something has to be done about it.</p><p>The one good thing I think that has happened is that it's going to be a lot easier to fix these programs with a very good economy like the one we have right now than if we were facing this catastrophe and had a bad economy.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it doesn't seem like anybody is taking this baton.</p><p>MARSHALL:  They knew about this at least a year ago.  Maybe we have some better numbers today.  But look, you have baby boomers that are going to enter the system, more people, and you have people with a double whammy right now, because you have some individuals, my mom is one of them, who rely largely on their Social Security to live.  How on earth are they going to make up any kind of a gap with Medicare if they can't afford any secondary insurance beyond what they are already paying?  This is something where the left and right, Democrats and Republicans, not only can work together but they have to, and they have to do it before it's on the brink of insolvency.</p><p>BAIER:  But the difference is pretty stark.  The White House reaction is this report is grim, but Medicare for all is not the answer.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And they are right.  The thing is the Trump administration has basically ignored the problem with entitlements while the Democrats are proposing things to make them much, much worse.  The simple fact is that we live in an economy where Social Security was created when we had something like over a dozen workers for every retiree.  Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65.  Now it's two-to-one per retiree.  We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people.  It is not sustainable.  It has got to be ripped up from the ground and figured out.  You have to grandfather in the people who are recipients now but then fix it for the coming generation.  That is nowhere on the horizon for what the Democrats are proposing, and the Republicans are just ignoring it.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, Medicare for all seems to be a litmus test for a lot of Democrats running this year.</p><p>HURT:  Yes, and unfortunately the idea of Medicare for all on top of the problems that we're facing right now is the typical government answer, more centralized governance from Washington.  That is the whole problem in the first place.  Making Medicare, expanding it massively, isn't going to fix it.  It's going to break it.</p><p>BAIER:  Panel, thank you.</p><p>Just moments ago, the president tweeted, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they are actually talking impeachment?  Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems?  No collusion!\" We obviously lead with that news tonight on the newscast tonight.  The president is welcome.  We're here a lot of Tuesdays down here on the North Lawn.  Any time.</p><p>When we come back, one brave police officer confronts a situation that could really stink things up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Nothing like a sunset at the White House.</p><p>Finally tonight, Police Officer Ron Kaszas in South Bend, Indiana, managed to pull off quite the rescue for one lucky skunk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I bet you this will go viral.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not in the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at those South Bend police officers.  They are always doing something good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The skunk had a cup on its head, in case you didn't see that.  There you go.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>I'm Bret Baier reporting tonight from the White House where the Trump administration continues to push back on impeachment narratives coming from Capitol Hill and from the left as the top polling Democrat prepares to officially enter the race.</p><p>But first despite the discord here in Washington post-Mueller report, the markets have taken that report in stride.  And tonight your 401(k) is probably a lot healthier than it has been in a while.</p><p>A big day on Wall Street as the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at record highs, recovering all the ground they lost in nose dive late last year.  The Dow had a strong performance today as well netting 145 closing in on its own record close.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 26.  The NASDAQ surged 106.</p><p>The market is buoyed by better-than-expected numbers from a number of companies today.</p><p>Let's get some analysis from Susan Li of the Fox Business Network.  She joins us from New York.  Good evening -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.</p><p>The bull market continues in 2019, surprising many that thought it was coming to an end especially after a dismal December.  The broader index -- the S&amp;P 500 surpassing its last record high struck in September last year.  It is also the 81st record under President Trump.  The NASDAQ hitting its 96th new record in this administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  He ended the war on business.  He's ended the war on success.  He believes strongly that if you do well and succeed you should be rewarded, not punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI:  What has been powering the rally?  The Federal Reserve's signaling that the Central Bank is not likely to raise interest rates this year.  Also signs that the U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and companies earnings that continue to defy gravity.  And that is despite bears' (ph) calls for a drop in corporate profits the first three months of the year.</p><p>Big tech has been one of the most favorite trade so far with big gains for Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft.  Virtually every sector has seen an advance with stocks big and small joining in on the rally.</p><p>A strong stock market and a growing U.S. economy that the President doesn't think gets enough media attention.  President Trump tweeting, \"In the old days if you are president and you had a good economy you are basically immune from criticism.\"</p><p>Now this week is another big test with tech giants Facebook and Microsoft reporting results tomorrow and first quarter GDP expected on Friday.  That is a big one, economist forecasting somewhere between 1.5 percent to maybe 2.5 percent growth -- a strong bounce back after a government shutdown to start off the year -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Susan Li in New York.  Susan,  thanks.</p><p>President Trump met with the CEO of Twitter here at the White House today.  The social media site has been a frequent target of the President's wrath but is also a primary communication tool for him.  And case in point, he just tweeted about the meeting last hour.  \"Great meeting this afternoon at the White House with @Jack from @Twitter.  Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform and the world of social media in general.  Look forward to keeping an open dialogue.\"  As you heard Susan mention Twitter was up nearly 16 percent today on the markets because of a positive earnings report.</p><p>Meantime one of the President's senior is communicating his thoughts about the ramifications of the Mueller report.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts begins there here on the north lawn.  Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, good evening to you.</p><p>It was one of those rare moments where we got to hear the first son-in-law Jared Kushner speak at length.  It was at the Time 100 Forum where Kushner had plenty to say about the Mueller report and the path that Congress is now taking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW:  All these people thought Trump was going to lose.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Weighing in for the first time on the Mueller report, Jared Kushner downplayed Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election insisting the real damage was done by the ensuing investigation.</p><p>KUSHNER:  You look at, you know, what Russia did, you know, buying some Facebook ads and tried to (INAUDIBLE) and do it.  And it's a terrible thing.  But I think the investigations and all the speculation that has happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Kushner said when Mueller came calling he was the first one to raise his hand to cooperate.  Spending hours with the special counsel, hours more in congressional committees and he fully embraced at least one of Mueller's findings.</p><p>KUSHNER:  The one thing the Mueller report was very conclusive on is there was absolutely no coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign.  And everything that the President has been saying, everything that I've been saying for two years has now been fully authenticated.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But Democrats want to know a lot more about the other part of the Mueller report -- presidential efforts to thwart the investigation.  The White House is deliberating whether to allow former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 21st.  The former chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, believes McGahn will testify with conditions.</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  I expect him to come, but I expect him to insist on having people behind him that can advise him as to when to answer a question and when a privilege might be appropriate.</p><p>ROBERTS:  The White House has already advised one former staffer to ignore a congressional subpoena.  Carl Kline, the former chief of White House personnel security was told not to show up for his scheduled deposition to the House Oversight Committee today.  Committee chairman Elijah Cummings said he will take a vote to hold Kline in contempt.</p><p>Following the lead of Senator Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate is all in on impeachment.  Senator Kamala Harris telling a town hall that Congress needs to act.</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe that we need to get rid of this president.  That this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice.  I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But at the same Time 100 forum where Kushner spoke, President Trump's opponent from 2016 took a more measured approach to the idea of impeachment.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  You don't put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table and say you're going to get there no matter what which is just what happened in '99.</p><p>Instead you say we are going to proceed with the seriousness that this demands.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS:  And Hillary Clinton knows all too well what happens when Congress barrels down that road to impeachment unimpeded.  But at the same time as all these congressional investigations are heating up President Trump will have a chance to get out of Washington for a while.</p><p>Just days after he returns from a trip to Japan to meet with the new emperor he will head off to the U.K. to meet with the Queen then cross the channel into Normandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  And he'll have a decision -- how much to fight, how much not to fight Congress.</p><p>ROBERTS:  I have a feeling they're going to fight all -- most if not all of these subpoenas.  I think the Kline subpoena fight is a good indication of which way they are going.</p><p>BAIER:  All right.  John -- thank you.</p><p>Well, senior officials at the Treasury Department are still trying to determine if a request for the President's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee is legal.  The Department missed today's deadline to turn over six years of the President's records.  The Treasury says it is waiting on the Justice Department to issue a report on the legality.  That conclusion will not be given to Treasury until May 6th.  The Treasury Secretary insisting the law does not allow Congress to set a deadline for the response.</p><p>Meantime a new alarm bells are sounding in Washington tonight over the long-term viability of the nation's bedrock social safety net programs for older Americans.  We first told you last night about a new government report stating that Medicare will become insolvent in just seven years if nothing is done.  And trustees write that Social Security is in trouble too, following close behind on insolvency.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Kevin Corke looks at where we are and what it means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  The Medicare trustees reported that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>The 2019 status of the Social Security and Medicare programs paints an alarming picture of the future of two of America's most indispensable entitlement programs.</p><p>VERMA:  We need to change the trajectory of health care cost growth to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>CORKE:  The report summarizes that at current projections Medicare's Hospital Insurance Fund will only be able to afford 89 percent of its total cost in just seven years.  And that Social Security program costs are likely to exceed total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982.</p><p>While Medicare and specifically Medicare for all have been the subject of a fierce political debate among Democrats this year, Trump administration officials say the program is also increasingly vulnerable.  With Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar writing in a statement that instead of trying to expand Medicare into quote, \"a universal entitlement that even covers wealthy Americans of working age, we need to fulfill Medicare's promise to our seniors.\"</p><p>SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The American people want and we are going to deliver a Medicare for all single-payer system.</p><p>CORKE:  Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders headlines a large field of 2020 Democrat contenders who back some form of Medicare for all with Sanders specifically advocating a single-payer system --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're going to will hurt your Social Security so badly.</p><p>CORKE:  According to the report the news is equally bleak for Social Security.  It forecast that its funds could be depleted by 2035 and that could lead to reductions in payouts to retirees and other beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Bret -- the real concern at Social Security offices like the one behind me is that with so many baby boomers nearing retirement age and soon to be drawing off the system, it is paramount that something be done to address the shortfall.</p><p>For its part the White House is asking congressional lawmakers to do something about it sooner rather than later -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Now to politics.  Former vice president Joe Biden will formally declare his candidacy for the top job Thursday.  That is a departure from the earlier plan of a Wednesday rollout and it comes as most polls indicate Biden leads the field of which he's not yet an official member.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy tells us where things stand right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long time politician who loves quoting Irish poets.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, I can't let a comment go by without quoting an Irish poet.</p><p>DOOCY:  The third time is a charm.  Joe Biden will announce another White House campaign with an online video Thursday, then a Pittsburgh rally Monday.  The 2020 bid follows a campaign in 1988 cut short by a plagiarism scandal and a campaign in 2008 that ended after the Iowa caucus.</p><p>BIDEN:  And let me make something clear to you, I ain't going away.</p><p>DOOCY:  Now the 76-year-old is set to become 2020's 20th candidate.</p><p>HARRIS:  Come on in.  The water is warm -- Joe.</p><p>DOOCY:  Kamala Harris is also pitching executive action on guns.</p><p>HARRIS:  Upon being elected I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.  And if they fail to do it then I will take executive action.</p><p>DOOCY:  So what has changed since Biden was Barack Obama's vice president when days after the Boston marathon bombing he condemned the culprit.</p><p>BIDEN:  Two, twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis here in Boston.</p><p>DOOCY:  Now, the Democratic front runner among declared candidates believes the surviving Boston bomber should be able to vote from jail.</p><p>SANDERS:  The right to vote is inherent to our democracy.  Yes, even for terrible people.</p><p>DOOCY:  One thing Biden has going for him -- name recognition.  Millions already know his story.</p><p>Amy Klobuchar isn't quite there yet.</p><p>SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have won every single congressional district in my state including Michelle Bachmann's.  That is when you guys are supposed to cheer, ok.</p><p>DOOCY:  One challenge for Biden maybe be generational.  He's more than twice the age of surging South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg who just updated his Web site with policy positions but approached accusations that he has pushed a hate hoax by attacking Mike Pence with caution.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm not a master fisherman but I know bait when I see it and I'm not going to take it.</p><p>DOOCY:  Joe Biden will bring less of a filter even when facing controversy.</p><p>BIDEN:  By the way, he gave me permission to touch him, all right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  As Biden's unwanted touching scandal grew Barack Obama never publicly defended him and now as Biden reportedly plans to roll out a long list of high-profile endorsements, it is not clear Obama will be one of them -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Peter -- thank you.</p><p>We are happy to announce Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg will appear on a Fox News town hall meeting next month.  The South Bend, Indiana mayor will join us from Claremont, New Hampshire Sunday May 19th at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.  Chris Wallace will moderate that.</p><p>We will also host Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar Wednesday May 8th from Milwaukee.  That airs at 6:30 p.m.  Martha MacCallum and I will moderate that town hall.</p><p>Now to the Republicans and the possibility of a second primary challenger to President Trump.  He is Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and he showed up today at a perfect spot to get the word out that he may be considering a run.</p><p>Correspondent Kristin Fisher shows us tonight from Manchester, New Hampshire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN (R), MARYLAND:  I just thought that April would be a beautiful time to visit New Hampshire.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maryland Governor Larry Logan played coy about his intentions in attending a must stop event for presidential candidates in the first primary state.  But over politics and eggs, the governor made clear he is seriously considering challenging President Trump.</p><p>HOGAN:  I'm not interested in just running to hurt the President, bruise the President.  I'm out here talking about things that I think are important.  I care about the future of my party.</p><p>FISHER:  But the Republican National Committee does not care for any Republican trying to take down President Trump including former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld who officially entered the race last week.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.  I mean the President has 93 percent approval in our party.</p><p>FISHER:  In January the Republican National Committee passed a resolution of undivided support for President Trump effectively merging the party and his reelection team into a single unit.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes.  I think this goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the President.  I mean I think it was wrong what the DNC did but this is much worse.</p><p>FISHER:  Today Hogan accused President Trump of trying to commit a crime, obstruction of justice.  And he slammed other Republicans for being too afraid to speak out.</p><p>Governor Weld agrees.</p><p>BILL WELD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They are all petrified of the President because they know he can't control his emotions and he's given to temper tantrums and being vindictive.</p><p>FISHER:  Hogan is aware that after today he could become President Trump's next target.  But Hogan believes he is uniquely qualified to sustain that kind of attack.</p><p>HOGAN:  I battled cancer for 18 months.  I can probably take him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER:  But could he upend more than a century of history.  The last time a primary challenger defeated a sitting president was in 1884 -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Kristin Fisher in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Kristin -- thanks.</p><p>The fate of a proposed citizenship question on next year's census is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Justices they heard arguments today right now.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @NIGHT\" Shannon Bream tells us what was said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE HO, ACLU VOTING RIGHTS PROJECT:  It is not about a line on a form.  It is about whether or not everyone in America counts.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:  But therein lies the problem the nine justices must untangle.  Whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross overstepped his authority by adding a citizenship question to the 2020 sentence.</p><p>Critics of the move say it will discourage people from completing the forms predicting it will lead to an undercount of primarily minority populations.  Today several of the liberal-leaning justices said the administration can get the information it is seeking from other government databases.</p><p>Of Ross' decision Justice Sotomayor said, quote, \"This seems like he thought of something, I want to add a citizenship question.\"  Adding, \"This is a solution in search of a problem.  I've got to find a problem that fits what I want to do.\"</p><p>But a number of the more conservative justices noted that the citizenship question has been included on various census forms nearly uniformly between 1820 and 1950.  And in a more limited way since then.</p><p>Justice Kavanaugh noting that the statute passed by Congress gives the Commerce Secretary enormous discretion in putting together the census form.  Asked why if Congress objects it hasn't already outlawed the question.  Quote, \"Why doesn't Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?\"</p><p>Opponents traced the entire debate back to the issue of immigration and claimed that the administration's sole purpose in asking about citizenship is to silence people in the U.S. illegally.  The administration says the President's priorities are both legal and fair.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We want to know who's in this country.  And I think as a sovereign nation we have that right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a decision from the court is due by late June and time is of the essence.  The census forms, whether they contain the citizenship question or not will head to the printing process this summer -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Shannon -- thank you.  See you at 11:00 p.m. tonight.</p><p>Up next, ISIS claims responsibility for the Easter Sunday massacre on Christians in Sri Lanka.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 25 in Boston where a Florida judge has ordered a video police say shows New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft paying for sex not be released publicly for now.  The judge accepted arguments by Kraft's attorneys that releasing the video could harm chances for a fair trial.

Some people out there as well, saying they support President Trump but they don't support Twitter.  President Trump meeting with the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, here at the White House today.  You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background.  Thought we'd show you what was happening.</p><p>In the meantime, a new legal challenge for embattled actor Jussie Smollett tonight.  Two of the men involved in what police say was a faked hate crime attacker are now throwing rhetorical punches at Smollett's lawyers.  Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin has details tonight from this story that is ever-changing in Chicago.  Good evening, Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  One way or the other we might still see actor Jussie Smollett in a real-life courtroom drama.  He is facing a lawsuit from the city of Chicago, and he may very well be called as a witness in the federal lawsuit that was filed today.</p><p>However, the actor was not named as a defendant.  The suit does say the attack was a hoax conceived and directed by Jussie Smollett right down to the use of a noose, bleach, and shouts that this is MAGA correspondent from the attackers.  The lawsuit is directed as his high-powered legal team, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian.  It claims after charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett, Geragos and Glandian did the rounds on news programs and podcasts.  Lawyers for the Osundairo brothers say Geragos and Glandian repeatedly made false, reprehensible, and damaging statements.  The brothers claim their reputation and personal training business were damaged.  They also suffered emotional distress.</p><p>Today attorney Gloria Schmidt said the two wannabe actors followed the direction of a successful actor, and now they want to clear their names.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLORIA SCHMIDT, OSUNDAIRO BROTHERS ATTORNEY:  They were asked to do something by a friend who they trusted, and at the end of the day that friend betrayed their trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN:  Geragos and Glandian hit back.  Part of their statement reads, \"This so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated.\" Geragos says the suit will be thrown out, it lacks legal footing.  The brothers are seeking an unspecified amount of money and legal costs.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Mike Tobin in Chicago.  We'll follow this.  Mike, thanks.</p><p>Meantime, Mexico is trying to show the U.S. it is getting more serious about stopping Central American migrants from reaching the southern border of the U.S.  Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt looks at a major move that took place Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Migrants fought back with sticks against what appeared to be a concerted effort by Mexican authorities to send a signal they will no longer be so accommodating to the thousands coming from Central America and heading to the U.S. border.  It was clearly a well-planned operation with police officers, according to A.P. reporters on scene, suggesting a group of hundreds of migrants take a break in the shade, as others from the approximately 3,000 strong caravan moved on.  Then as the trailing group rested, the Mexican authorities moved in.  Large numbers of officers grabbing men, women, and children, taking them away to waiting buses.  More than 350 were picked up in total according to Mexico's National Migration Institute, which blamed the violence on a small group of aggressive migrants.  Journalists traveling with a caravans have also reportedly that migrants are getting a far less hospitable welcome in the Mexican towns they travel through than was the case several months ago.</p><p>KEVIN MCALEENAN, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  Any solution we're going to have to reduce this flow is going to rely on Mexican authorities to take a stronger action, frankly, against people that are exploiting migrants.</p><p>HUNT:  Customs and Border Protection officials also shared this video with FOX News today which they say was shot on the Arizona-Mexico border on Saturday, and shows heavily armed smugglers escorting a Guatemalan woman and boy into the U.S.  CBP says it is concerned to see those sort of weapons now being used by human smugglers right on the border.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNT:  The woman and her son were quickly detained by CBP agents.  The armed smugglers are still at large somewhere in Mexico.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>Joe Biden pushes back his entry into the 2020 race by a day, and President Trump may be getting another Republican challenger.  We'll talk about it all and the 2020 election when the panel joins me after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE:  The impeachment proceedings are up to the House.  They are going to have to make that decision.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think he has made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment.  I'm also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  Every person in the Senate and the House, they should take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I want to see about that investigation.  We'll see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  \"Impeachment\" the word of the day for the town hall with the 2020 candidates, as you look at a list, a ever-growing of people getting into the 2020 race.  It is a lot easier, it seems, for them to say, sure, go ahead and impeach President Trump, than it is for House Democrats to get to that conclusion and the logistical hurdles ahead.</p><p>As you look at the polls new out today, Monmouth poll, has Joe Biden is in the lead and you see Bernie Sanders in second.  Pete Buttigieg, they mayor, look at that, less that one percent to eight percent just in a short time.  And then if you look at Iowa, obviously the first stop the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden also leading there, the margin a little bit smaller, and Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in third.</p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\"  Jonah, we've had this kind of launch, non-launch for Joe Biden.  He was going to go Wednesday, now it's Thursday.  We don't have a lot of details on what it looks like, but he's clearly still leading in some of these big pools.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\":  He is.  And I think he is well-positioned.  I don't usually give a lot advice to Democrats, but if I were him, I would come out, I would announce and immediately take dead aim at Bernie Sanders and say this is a two-person race.  I'm the grown up.  I'm a liberal, but I'm not a socialist.  The party will go down in flames if we pursue Bernie's path.  It will make everybody else look small.  He is basically the only guy in a position who can do that.</p><p>And I think that one of the things we see is that a lot of the Democratic primary people, they think that basically Democratic Twitter is the actual Democratic electorate, and it's not.  And he is one of the only people who is positioned to actually reach out to the traditional Democratic voter.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, you do wonder, though, about the launch or decision to launch and what transpired there.  All we are told is that something will happen Thursday, a video launch, and then there's a Monday event in Pittsburgh.  I don't know what happens between Thursday and Monday, but it's interesting.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Originally it was supposed to be Wednesday, tomorrow, as you know.  And one of the reasons they delayed it, I'm being told, is Charlottesville.  A lot of people thought at first that might be a good place for the former vice president to announce, but then there was some kickback, people felt it was disrespectful, they decided not to do it, and that delayed them some.</p><p>There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track.  But I and other Democrats are not worried yet.  He is still leading in almost every poll, and he hasn't yet announced.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, a lot of that has to do with name recognition, a lot of that has to do with eight years as vice president, and you wonder how Joe Biden is going to compete with a pretty energetic and obviously voluminous candidate spread on the Democratic side.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years.  He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time.  And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything.</p><p>And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington.  And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much.  And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them.  The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess.</p><p>BAIER:  It doesn't seem like President Trump has settled on a nickname yet.  He had one percent Joe for past races, then he had sleepy Joe.  We don't know where he will end up.</p><p>Jonah, voting rights for prisoners came up last night in the town halls and seemed to be a little bit of a separation.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should people convicted of sexual assault, the Boston Marathon bomber, should they be able to vote?</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  While incarcerated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do believe that even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think we should have that conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Is this an issue that Iowa and New Hampshire cares about?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  It is a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.  Buttigieg gave the exact right answer, and Bernie Sanders' position I find utterly baffling.  Look, when you go to this thing called prison, you have lots of rights that are curtailed.  The freedom of assembly, freedom of speech all sorts of things.  One of the others ones happens to be freedom to vote.  It is another thing entirely when you pay back your debt to society about whether or not you should have your voting rights restored.  But the idea that Bernie Sanders is getting out like free candy these Willie Horton type issues where he wants the worst terrorists in America to be able to vote, it's bizarre to me.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it's one thing to be talking about Medicare for all and the details of that and then the Green New Deal and how you're going to pay for it, but it seems that that, prisoners voting, Electoral College, seem on the outskirts.</p><p>MARSHALL:  Definitely.  In dark corners, if you will, Democrats like myself are saying, why are they even making this an issue?  Mayor Pete got it right.  When somebody commits a crime, and I think most Democrats feel this way, they lose their rights as a free individual.  Now, when they get out of prison, if they get those rights restored that's a whole other conversation.  We've seen that.  There are people left and right that can agree to that.  And this is a can of worms that a Democrat doesn't need to open because we have so many other areas.  The only good thing about this, Bret, is this is one area where they all did not agree on this issue.</p><p>BAIER:  All right, finally, you have William Weld on the Republican side throwing his name in the hat, an uphill battle obviously.  Now you have potentially the Maryland governor.  Take a listen to Larry Hogan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN, (R) MARYLAND:  I think it goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the president.  I think it was wrong what the DNC did, but this is much worse.</p><p>To change the rules and to insist 100 percent royalty to the dear leader, it just didn't sound very much like the Republican Party that I grew up in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, you don't go to politics in New Hampshire unless you are really thinking about it.</p><p>HURT:  I think that is right.  And by the way, I think it is a great thing.  I think anybody wants to get in and stir the pot is great.  But the bottom line remains, the president remains one of the most popular Republicans among Republicans in recent times, and he's going to be the nominee.  With Bernie Sanders, I'm calling it the 50-state strategy to make sure that even Massachusetts votes for Republicans.  With crazy ideas like letting the Boston Marathon bomber's vote, a guy like President Trump is in a good position I think to win reelection.</p><p>BAIER:  By the way, Alex Jones agrees with you behind the gate here with his microphone.  Panel, stand by.  Next up, a grim outlook for Medicare and Social Security.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  Health care spending in America is on an unsustainable path.  The Medicare Trustees reported that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you take Social Security, it's 25 percent of the federal budget, and it's growing faster than the GDP.  You add in Medicare and Medicaid and now you're up to about 55 percent, 55 percent of the entire federal budget.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  We saw some disturbing numbers from the Trustees report.  As you heard Medicare seven years from now depleted in the hospital insurance pond.  That happens then Medicare Part A will only be able to cover 89 percent of the cost for hospital stays and related services, and that will go down to 77 percent in 2046.  On Social Security, total costs projected to exceed its total income including interests for the first time since 1982.  The bottom line is something has to be done to save these programs if we are going to.  We are back with a panel.  Charlie?</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  This is a slow-rolling catastrophe, and it's not something that we haven't known for a long time.  Obviously, people like Paul Ryan have been talking about it for a long time.  President Trump obviously ran in 2016 vowing not to touch these programs.  Obviously, that was a smart move back then, but the fact remains that they are going consultants and something has to be done about it.</p><p>The one good thing I think that has happened is that it's going to be a lot easier to fix these programs with a very good economy like the one we have right now than if we were facing this catastrophe and had a bad economy.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it doesn't seem like anybody is taking this baton.</p><p>MARSHALL:  They knew about this at least a year ago.  Maybe we have some better numbers today.  But look, you have baby boomers that are going to enter the system, more people, and you have people with a double whammy right now, because you have some individuals, my mom is one of them, who rely largely on their Social Security to live.  How on earth are they going to make up any kind of a gap with Medicare if they can't afford any secondary insurance beyond what they are already paying?  This is something where the left and right, Democrats and Republicans, not only can work together but they have to, and they have to do it before it's on the brink of insolvency.</p><p>BAIER:  But the difference is pretty stark.  The White House reaction is this report is grim, but Medicare for all is not the answer.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And they are right.  The thing is the Trump administration has basically ignored the problem with entitlements while the Democrats are proposing things to make them much, much worse.  The simple fact is that we live in an economy where Social Security was created when we had something like over a dozen workers for every retiree.  Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65.  Now it's two-to-one per retiree.  We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people.  It is not sustainable.  It has got to be ripped up from the ground and figured out.  You have to grandfather in the people who are recipients now but then fix it for the coming generation.  That is nowhere on the horizon for what the Democrats are proposing, and the Republicans are just ignoring it.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, Medicare for all seems to be a litmus test for a lot of Democrats running this year.</p><p>HURT:  Yes, and unfortunately the idea of Medicare for all on top of the problems that we're facing right now is the typical government answer, more centralized governance from Washington.  That is the whole problem in the first place.  Making Medicare, expanding it massively, isn't going to fix it.  It's going to break it.</p><p>BAIER:  Panel, thank you.</p><p>Just moments ago, the president tweeted, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they are actually talking impeachment?  Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems?  No collusion!\" We obviously lead with that news tonight on the newscast tonight.  The president is welcome.

This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>I'm Bret Baier reporting tonight from the White House where the Trump administration continues to push back on impeachment narratives coming from Capitol Hill and from the left as the top polling Democrat prepares to officially enter the race.</p><p>But first despite the discord here in Washington post-Mueller report, the markets have taken that report in stride.  And tonight your 401(k) is probably a lot healthier than it has been in a while.</p><p>A big day on Wall Street as the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at record highs, recovering all the ground they lost in nose dive late last year.  The Dow had a strong performance today as well netting 145 closing in on its own record close.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 26.  The NASDAQ surged 106.</p><p>The market is buoyed by better-than-expected numbers from a number of companies today.</p><p>Let's get some analysis from Susan Li of the Fox Business Network.  She joins us from New York.  Good evening -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.</p><p>The bull market continues in 2019, surprising many that thought it was coming to an end especially after a dismal December.  The broader index -- the S&amp;P 500 surpassing its last record high struck in September last year.  It is also the 81st record under President Trump.  The NASDAQ hitting its 96th new record in this administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  He ended the war on business.  He's ended the war on success.  He believes strongly that if you do well and succeed you should be rewarded, not punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI:  What has been powering the rally?  The Federal Reserve's signaling that the Central Bank is not likely to raise interest rates this year.  Also signs that the U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and companies earnings that continue to defy gravity.  And that is despite bears' (ph) calls for a drop in corporate profits the first three months of the year.</p><p>Big tech has been one of the most favorite trade so far with big gains for Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft.  Virtually every sector has seen an advance with stocks big and small joining in on the rally.</p><p>A strong stock market and a growing U.S. economy that the President doesn't think gets enough media attention.  President Trump tweeting, \"In the old days if you are president and you had a good economy you are basically immune from criticism.\"</p><p>Now this week is another big test with tech giants Facebook and Microsoft reporting results tomorrow and first quarter GDP expected on Friday.  That is a big one, economist forecasting somewhere between 1.5 percent to maybe 2.5 percent growth -- a strong bounce back after a government shutdown to start off the year -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Susan Li in New York.  Susan,  thanks.</p><p>President Trump met with the CEO of Twitter here at the White House today.  The social media site has been a frequent target of the President's wrath but is also a primary communication tool for him.  And case in point, he just tweeted about the meeting last hour.  \"Great meeting this afternoon at the White House with @Jack from @Twitter.  Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform and the world of social media in general.  Look forward to keeping an open dialogue.\"  As you heard Susan mention Twitter was up nearly 16 percent today on the markets because of a positive earnings report.</p><p>Meantime one of the President's senior is communicating his thoughts about the ramifications of the Mueller report.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts begins there here on the north lawn.  Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, good evening to you.</p><p>It was one of those rare moments where we got to hear the first son-in-law Jared Kushner speak at length.  It was at the Time 100 Forum where Kushner had plenty to say about the Mueller report and the path that Congress is now taking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW:  All these people thought Trump was going to lose.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Weighing in for the first time on the Mueller report, Jared Kushner downplayed Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election insisting the real damage was done by the ensuing investigation.</p><p>KUSHNER:  You look at, you know, what Russia did, you know, buying some Facebook ads and tried to (INAUDIBLE) and do it.  And it's a terrible thing.  But I think the investigations and all the speculation that has happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Kushner said when Mueller came calling he was the first one to raise his hand to cooperate.  Spending hours with the special counsel, hours more in congressional committees and he fully embraced at least one of Mueller's findings.</p><p>KUSHNER:  The one thing the Mueller report was very conclusive on is there was absolutely no coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign.  And everything that the President has been saying, everything that I've been saying for two years has now been fully authenticated.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But Democrats want to know a lot more about the other part of the Mueller report -- presidential efforts to thwart the investigation.  The White House is deliberating whether to allow former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 21st.  The former chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, believes McGahn will testify with conditions.</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  I expect him to come, but I expect him to insist on having people behind him that can advise him as to when to answer a question and when a privilege might be appropriate.</p><p>ROBERTS:  The White House has already advised one former staffer to ignore a congressional subpoena.  Carl Kline, the former chief of White House personnel security was told not to show up for his scheduled deposition to the House Oversight Committee today.  Committee chairman Elijah Cummings said he will take a vote to hold Kline in contempt.</p><p>Following the lead of Senator Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate is all in on impeachment.  Senator Kamala Harris telling a town hall that Congress needs to act.</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe that we need to get rid of this president.  That this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice.  I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But at the same Time 100 forum where Kushner spoke, President Trump's opponent from 2016 took a more measured approach to the idea of impeachment.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  You don't put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table and say you're going to get there no matter what which is just what happened in '99.</p><p>Instead you say we are going to proceed with the seriousness that this demands.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS:  And Hillary Clinton knows all too well what happens when Congress barrels down that road to impeachment unimpeded.  But at the same time as all these congressional investigations are heating up President Trump will have a chance to get out of Washington for a while.</p><p>Just days after he returns from a trip to Japan to meet with the new emperor he will head off to the U.K. to meet with the Queen then cross the channel into Normandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  And he'll have a decision -- how much to fight, how much not to fight Congress.</p><p>ROBERTS:  I have a feeling they're going to fight all -- most if not all of these subpoenas.  I think the Kline subpoena fight is a good indication of which way they are going.</p><p>BAIER:  All right.  John -- thank you.</p><p>Well, senior officials at the Treasury Department are still trying to determine if a request for the President's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee is legal.  The Department missed today's deadline to turn over six years of the President's records.  The Treasury says it is waiting on the Justice Department to issue a report on the legality.  That conclusion will not be given to Treasury until May 6th.  The Treasury Secretary insisting the law does not allow Congress to set a deadline for the response.</p><p>Meantime a new alarm bells are sounding in Washington tonight over the long-term viability of the nation's bedrock social safety net programs for older Americans.  We first told you last night about a new government report stating that Medicare will become insolvent in just seven years if nothing is done.

And that Social Security program costs are likely to exceed total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982.</p><p>While Medicare and specifically Medicare for all have been the subject of a fierce political debate among Democrats this year, Trump administration officials say the program is also increasingly vulnerable.

Former vice president Joe Biden will formally declare his candidacy for the top job Thursday.

Joe Biden will announce another White House campaign with an online video Thursday, then a Pittsburgh rally Monday.  The 2020 bid follows a campaign in 1988 cut short by a plagiarism scandal and a campaign in 2008 that ended after the Iowa caucus.</p><p>BIDEN:  And let me make something clear to you, I ain't going away.</p><p>DOOCY:  Now the 76-year-old is set to become 2020's 20th candidate.</p><p>HARRIS:  Come on in.

But over politics and eggs, the governor made clear he is seriously considering challenging President Trump.</p><p>HOGAN:  I'm not interested in just running to hurt the President, bruise the President.  I'm out here talking about things that I think are important.  I care about the future of my party.</p><p>FISHER:  But the Republican National Committee does not care for any Republican trying to take down President Trump including former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld who officially entered the race last week.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.  I mean the President has 93 percent approval in our party.</p><p>FISHER:  In January the Republican National Committee passed a resolution of undivided support for President Trump effectively merging the party and his reelection team into a single unit.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes.  I think this goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the President.  I mean I think it was wrong what the DNC did but this is much worse.</p><p>FISHER:  Today Hogan accused President Trump of trying to commit a crime, obstruction of justice.  And he slammed other Republicans for being too afraid to speak out.</p><p>Governor Weld agrees.</p><p>BILL WELD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They are all petrified of the President because they know he can't control his emotions and he's given to temper tantrums and being vindictive.</p><p>FISHER:  Hogan is aware that after today he could become President Trump's next target.  But Hogan believes he is uniquely qualified to sustain that kind of attack.</p><p>HOGAN:  I battled cancer for 18 months.

Justices they heard arguments today right now.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @NIGHT\" Shannon Bream tells us what was said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE HO, ACLU VOTING RIGHTS PROJECT:  It is not about a line on a form.  It is about whether or not everyone in America counts.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:  But therein lies the problem the nine justices must untangle.  Whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross overstepped his authority by adding a citizenship question to the 2020 sentence.</p><p>Critics of the move say it will discourage people from completing the forms predicting it will lead to an undercount of primarily minority populations.  Today several of the liberal-leaning justices said the administration can get the information it is seeking from other government databases.</p><p>Of Ross' decision Justice Sotomayor said, quote, \"This seems like he thought of something, I want to add a citizenship question.\"  Adding, \"This is a solution in search of a problem.  I've got to find a problem that fits what I want to do.\"</p><p>But a number of the more conservative justices noted that the citizenship question has been included on various census forms nearly uniformly between 1820 and 1950.  And in a more limited way since then.</p><p>Justice Kavanaugh noting that the statute passed by Congress gives the Commerce Secretary enormous discretion in putting together the census form.  Asked why if Congress objects it hasn't already outlawed the question.  Quote, \"Why doesn't Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?\"</p><p>Opponents traced the entire debate back to the issue of immigration and claimed that the administration's sole purpose in asking about citizenship is to silence people in the U.S. illegally.  The administration says the President's priorities are both legal and fair.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We want to know who's in this country.  And I think as a sovereign nation we have that right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a decision from the court is due by late June and time is of the essence.

You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background.  Thought we'd show you what was happening.</p><p>In the meantime, a new legal challenge for embattled actor Jussie Smollett tonight.  Two of the men involved in what police say was a faked hate crime attacker are now throwing rhetorical punches at Smollett's lawyers.  Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin has details tonight from this story that is ever-changing in Chicago.  Good evening, Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  One way or the other we might still see actor Jussie Smollett in a real-life courtroom drama.  He is facing a lawsuit from the city of Chicago, and he may very well be called as a witness in the federal lawsuit that was filed today.</p><p>However, the actor was not named as a defendant.  The suit does say the attack was a hoax conceived and directed by Jussie Smollett right down to the use of a noose, bleach, and shouts that this is MAGA correspondent from the attackers.  The lawsuit is directed as his high-powered legal team, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian.  It claims after charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett, Geragos and Glandian did the rounds on news programs and podcasts.  Lawyers for the Osundairo brothers say Geragos and Glandian repeatedly made false, reprehensible, and damaging statements.  The brothers claim their reputation and personal training business were damaged.  They also suffered emotional distress.</p><p>Today attorney Gloria Schmidt said the two wannabe actors followed the direction of a successful actor, and now they want to clear their names.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLORIA SCHMIDT, OSUNDAIRO BROTHERS ATTORNEY:  They were asked to do something by a friend who they trusted, and at the end of the day that friend betrayed their trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN:  Geragos and Glandian hit back.  Part of their statement reads, \"This so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated.\" Geragos says the suit will be thrown out, it lacks legal footing.  The brothers are seeking an unspecified amount of money and legal costs.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Mike Tobin in Chicago.  We'll follow this.  Mike, thanks.</p><p>Meantime, Mexico is trying to show the U.S. it is getting more serious about stopping Central American migrants from reaching the southern border of the U.S.  Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt looks at a major move that took place Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Migrants fought back with sticks against what appeared to be a concerted effort by Mexican authorities to send a signal they will no longer be so accommodating to the thousands coming from Central America and heading to the U.S. border.  It was clearly a well-planned operation with police officers, according to A.P. reporters on scene, suggesting a group of hundreds of migrants take a break in the shade, as others from the approximately 3,000 strong caravan moved on.  Then as the trailing group rested, the Mexican authorities moved in.  Large numbers of officers grabbing men, women, and children, taking them away to waiting buses.  More than 350 were picked up in total according to Mexico's National Migration Institute, which blamed the violence on a small group of aggressive migrants.  Journalists traveling with a caravans have also reportedly that migrants are getting a far less hospitable welcome in the Mexican towns they travel through than was the case several months ago.</p><p>KEVIN MCALEENAN, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  Any solution we're going to have to reduce this flow is going to rely on Mexican authorities to take a stronger action, frankly, against people that are exploiting migrants.</p><p>HUNT:  Customs and Border Protection officials also shared this video with FOX News today which they say was shot on the Arizona-Mexico border on Saturday, and shows heavily armed smugglers escorting a Guatemalan woman and boy into the U.S.  CBP says it is concerned to see those sort of weapons now being used by human smugglers right on the border.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNT:  The woman and her son were quickly detained by CBP agents.  The armed smugglers are still at large somewhere in Mexico.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>Joe Biden pushes back his entry into the 2020 race by a day, and President Trump may be getting another Republican challenger.  We'll talk about it all and the 2020 election when the panel joins me after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE:  The impeachment proceedings are up to the House.  They are going to have to make that decision.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think he has made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment.  I'm also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  Every person in the Senate and the House, they should take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I want to see about that investigation.  We'll see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  \"Impeachment\" the word of the day for the town hall with the 2020 candidates, as you look at a list, a ever-growing of people getting into the 2020 race.  It is a lot easier, it seems, for them to say, sure, go ahead and impeach President Trump, than it is for House Democrats to get to that conclusion and the logistical hurdles ahead.</p><p>As you look at the polls new out today, Monmouth poll, has Joe Biden is in the lead and you see Bernie Sanders in second.  Pete Buttigieg, they mayor, look at that, less that one percent to eight percent just in a short time.  And then if you look at Iowa, obviously the first stop the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden also leading there, the margin a little bit smaller, and Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in third.</p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\"  Jonah, we've had this kind of launch, non-launch for Joe Biden.  He was going to go Wednesday, now it's Thursday.  We don't have a lot of details on what it looks like, but he's clearly still leading in some of these big pools.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\":  He is.  And I think he is well-positioned.  I don't usually give a lot advice to Democrats, but if I were him, I would come out, I would announce and immediately take dead aim at Bernie Sanders and say this is a two-person race.  I'm the grown up.  I'm a liberal, but I'm not a socialist.  The party will go down in flames if we pursue Bernie's path.  It will make everybody else look small.  He is basically the only guy in a position who can do that.</p><p>And I think that one of the things we see is that a lot of the Democratic primary people, they think that basically Democratic Twitter is the actual Democratic electorate, and it's not.  And he is one of the only people who is positioned to actually reach out to the traditional Democratic voter.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, you do wonder, though, about the launch or decision to launch and what transpired there.  All we are told is that something will happen Thursday, a video launch, and then there's a Monday event in Pittsburgh.  I don't know what happens between Thursday and Monday, but it's interesting.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Originally it was supposed to be Wednesday, tomorrow, as you know.  And one of the reasons they delayed it, I'm being told, is Charlottesville.  A lot of people thought at first that might be a good place for the former vice president to announce, but then there was some kickback, people felt it was disrespectful, they decided not to do it, and that delayed them some.</p><p>There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track.  But I and other Democrats are not worried yet.  He is still leading in almost every poll, and he hasn't yet announced.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, a lot of that has to do with name recognition, a lot of that has to do with eight years as vice president, and you wonder how Joe Biden is going to compete with a pretty energetic and obviously voluminous candidate spread on the Democratic side.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years.  He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time.  And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything.</p><p>And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington.  And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much.  And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them.  The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess.</p><p>BAIER:  It doesn't seem like President Trump has settled on a nickname yet.  He had one percent Joe for past races, then he had sleepy Joe.  We don't know where he will end up.</p><p>Jonah, voting rights for prisoners came up last night in the town halls and seemed to be a little bit of a separation.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should people convicted of sexual assault, the Boston Marathon bomber, should they be able to vote?</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  While incarcerated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do believe that even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think we should have that conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Is this an issue that Iowa and New Hampshire cares about?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  It is a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.  Buttigieg gave the exact right answer, and Bernie Sanders' position I find utterly baffling.  Look, when you go to this thing called prison, you have lots of rights that are curtailed.  The freedom of assembly, freedom of speech all sorts of things.  One of the others ones happens to be freedom to vote.  It is another thing entirely when you pay back your debt to society about whether or not you should have your voting rights restored.  But the idea that Bernie Sanders is getting out like free candy these Willie Horton type issues where he wants the worst terrorists in America to be able to vote, it's bizarre to me.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it's one thing to be talking about Medicare for all and the details of that and then the Green New Deal and how you're going to pay for it, but it seems that that, prisoners voting, Electoral College, seem on the outskirts.</p><p>MARSHALL:  Definitely.  In dark corners, if you will, Democrats like myself are saying, why are they even making this an issue?  Mayor Pete got it right.  When somebody commits a crime, and I think most Democrats feel this way, they lose their rights as a free individual.  Now, when they get out of prison, if they get those rights restored that's a whole other conversation.  We've seen that.  There are people left and right that can agree to that.  And this is a can of worms that a Democrat doesn't need to open because we have so many other areas.  The only good thing about this, Bret, is this is one area where they all did not agree on this issue.</p><p>BAIER:  All right, finally, you have William Weld on the Republican side throwing his name in the hat, an uphill battle obviously.  Now you have potentially the Maryland governor.  Take a listen to Larry Hogan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN, (R) MARYLAND:  I think it goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the president.  I think it was wrong what the DNC did, but this is much worse.</p><p>To change the rules and to insist 100 percent royalty to the dear leader, it just didn't sound very much like the Republican Party that I grew up in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, you don't go to politics in New Hampshire unless you are really thinking about it.</p><p>HURT:  I think that is right.  And by the way, I think it is a great thing.  I think anybody wants to get in and stir the pot is great.  But the bottom line remains, the president remains one of the most popular Republicans among Republicans in recent times, and he's going to be the nominee.  With Bernie Sanders, I'm calling it the 50-state strategy to make sure that even Massachusetts votes for Republicans.  With crazy ideas like letting the Boston Marathon bomber's vote, a guy like President Trump is in a good position I think to win reelection.</p><p>BAIER:  By the way, Alex Jones agrees with you behind the gate here with his microphone.  Panel, stand by.  Next up, a grim outlook for Medicare and Social Security.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  Health care spending in America is on an unsustainable path.  The Medicare Trustees reported that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you take Social Security, it's 25 percent of the federal budget, and it's growing faster than the GDP.  You add in Medicare and Medicaid and now you're up to about 55 percent, 55 percent of the entire federal budget.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  We saw some disturbing numbers from the Trustees report.  As you heard Medicare seven years from now depleted in the hospital insurance pond.  That happens then Medicare Part A will only be able to cover 89 percent of the cost for hospital stays and related services, and that will go down to 77 percent in 2046.  On Social Security, total costs projected to exceed its total income including interests for the first time since 1982.  The bottom line is something has to be done to save these programs if we are going to.  We are back with a panel.  Charlie?</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  This is a slow-rolling catastrophe, and it's not something that we haven't known for a long time.  Obviously, people like Paul Ryan have been talking about it for a long time.  President Trump obviously ran in 2016 vowing not to touch these programs.  Obviously, that was a smart move back then, but the fact remains that they are going consultants and something has to be done about it.</p><p>The one good thing I think that has happened is that it's going to be a lot easier to fix these programs with a very good economy like the one we have right now than if we were facing this catastrophe and had a bad economy.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it doesn't seem like anybody is taking this baton.</p><p>MARSHALL:  They knew about this at least a year ago.  Maybe we have some better numbers today.  But look, you have baby boomers that are going to enter the system, more people, and you have people with a double whammy right now, because you have some individuals, my mom is one of them, who rely largely on their Social Security to live.  How on earth are they going to make up any kind of a gap with Medicare if they can't afford any secondary insurance beyond what they are already paying?  This is something where the left and right, Democrats and Republicans, not only can work together but they have to, and they have to do it before it's on the brink of insolvency.</p><p>BAIER:  But the difference is pretty stark.  The White House reaction is this report is grim, but Medicare for all is not the answer.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And they are right.  The thing is the Trump administration has basically ignored the problem with entitlements while the Democrats are proposing things to make them much, much worse.  The simple fact is that we live in an economy where Social Security was created when we had something like over a dozen workers for every retiree.  Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65.  Now it's two-to-one per retiree.  We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people.  It is not sustainable.  It has got to be ripped up from the ground and figured out.  You have to grandfather in the people who are recipients now but then fix it for the coming generation.  That is nowhere on the horizon for what the Democrats are proposing, and the Republicans are just ignoring it.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, Medicare for all seems to be a litmus test for a lot of Democrats running this year.</p><p>HURT:  Yes, and unfortunately the idea of Medicare for all on top of the problems that we're facing right now is the typical government answer, more centralized governance from Washington.  That is the whole problem in the first place.  Making Medicare, expanding it massively, isn't going to fix it.  It's going to break it.</p><p>BAIER:  Panel, thank you.</p><p>Just moments ago, the president tweeted, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they are actually talking impeachment?  Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems?  No collusion!\" We obviously lead with that news tonight on the newscast tonight.  The president is welcome.  We're here a lot of Tuesdays down here on the North Lawn.  Any time.</p><p>When we come back, one brave police officer confronts a situation that could really stink things up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Nothing like a sunset at the White House.</p><p>Finally tonight, Police Officer Ron Kaszas in South Bend, Indiana, managed to pull off quite the rescue for one lucky skunk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I bet you this will go viral.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not in the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at those South Bend police officers.  They are always doing something good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The skunk had a cup on its head, in case you didn't see that.  There you go.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That is it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.  \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2213261960</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-79N1-DY0W-410J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7410\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

The broader index -- the S&amp;P 500 surpassing its last record high struck in September last year. It is also the 81st record under President Trump. The NASDAQ hitting its 96th new record in this administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: He ended the war on business.

The Federal Reserve's signaling that the Central Bank is not likely to raise interest rates this year. Also signs that the U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and companies earnings that continue to defy gravity. And that is despite bears' (ph) calls for a drop in corporate profits the first three months of the year.</p><p>Big tech has been one of the most favorite trade so far with big gains for Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft. Virtually every sector has seen an advance with stocks big and small joining in on the rally.</p><p>A strong stock market and a growing U.S. economy that the President doesn't think gets enough media attention. President Trump tweeting, \"In the old days if you are president and you had a good economy you are basically immune from criticism.\"</p><p>Now this week is another big test with tech giants Facebook and Microsoft reporting results tomorrow and first quarter GDP expected on Friday. That is a big one, economist forecasting somewhere between 1.5 percent to maybe 2.5 percent growth -- a strong bounce back after a government shutdown to start off the year -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Susan Li in New York. Susan, thanks.</p><p>President Trump met with the CEO of Twitter here at the White House today. The social media site has been a frequent target of the President's wrath but is also a primary communication tool for him. And case in point, he just tweeted about the meeting last hour. \"Great meeting this afternoon at the White House with @Jack from @Twitter. Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform and the world of social media in general. Look forward to keeping an open dialogue.\" As you heard Susan mention Twitter was up nearly 16 percent today on the markets because of a positive earnings report.</p><p>Meantime one of the President's senior is communicating his thoughts about the ramifications of the Mueller report.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts begins there here on the north lawn. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you.</p><p>It was one of those rare moments where we got to hear the first son-in-law Jared Kushner speak at length. It was at the Time 100 Forum where Kushner had plenty to say about the Mueller report and the path that Congress is now taking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW: All these people thought Trump was going to lose.</p><p>ROBERTS: Weighing in for the first time on the Mueller report, Jared Kushner downplayed Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election insisting the real damage was done by the ensuing investigation.</p><p>KUSHNER: You look at, you know, what Russia did, you know, buying some Facebook ads and tried to (INAUDIBLE) and do it. And it's a terrible thing. But I think the investigations and all the speculation that has happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.</p><p>ROBERTS: Kushner said when Mueller came calling he was the first one to raise his hand to cooperate. Spending hours with the special counsel, hours more in congressional committees and he fully embraced at least one of Mueller's findings.</p><p>KUSHNER: The one thing the Mueller report was very conclusive on is there was absolutely no coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign. And everything that the President has been saying, everything that I've been saying for two years has now been fully authenticated.</p><p>ROBERTS: But Democrats want to know a lot more about the other part of the Mueller report -- presidential efforts to thwart the investigation. The White House is deliberating whether to allow former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 21st. The former chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, believes McGahn will testify with conditions.</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: I expect him to come, but I expect him to insist on having people behind him that can advise him as to when to answer a question and when a privilege might be appropriate.</p><p>ROBERTS: The White House has already advised one former staffer to ignore a congressional subpoena. Carl Kline, the former chief of White House personnel security was told not to show up for his scheduled deposition to the House Oversight Committee today. Committee chairman Elijah Cummings said he will take a vote to hold Kline in contempt.</p><p>Following the lead of Senator Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate is all in on impeachment. Senator Kamala Harris telling a town hall that Congress needs to act.</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe that we need to get rid of this president. That this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice. I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>ROBERTS: But at the same Time 100 forum where Kushner spoke, President Trump's opponent from 2016 took a more measured approach to the idea of impeachment.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: You don't put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table and say you're going to get there no matter what which is just what happened in '99.</p><p>Instead you say we are going to proceed with the seriousness that this demands.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: And Hillary Clinton knows all too well what happens when Congress barrels down that road to impeachment unimpeded. But at the same time as all these congressional investigations are heating up President Trump will have a chance to get out of Washington for a while.</p><p>Just days after he returns from a trip to Japan to meet with the new emperor he will head off to the U.K. to meet with the Queen then cross the channel into Normandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: And he'll have a decision -- how much to fight, how much not to fight Congress.</p><p>ROBERTS: I have a feeling they're going to fight all -- most if not all of these subpoenas. I think the Kline subpoena fight is a good indication of which way they are going.</p><p>BAIER: All right. John -- thank you.</p><p>Well, senior officials at the Treasury Department are still trying to determine if a request for the President's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee is legal. The Department missed today's deadline to turn over six years of the President's records. The Treasury says it is waiting on the Justice Department to issue a report on the legality. That conclusion will not be given to Treasury until May 6th. The Treasury Secretary insisting the law does not allow Congress to set a deadline for the response.</p><p>Meantime a new alarm bells are sounding in Washington tonight over the long-term viability of the nation's bedrock social safety net programs for older Americans. We first told you last night about a new government report stating that Medicare will become insolvent in just seven years if nothing is done. And trustees write that Social Security is in trouble too, following close behind on insolvency.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Kevin Corke looks at where we are and what it means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES: The Medicare trustees reported that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>The 2019 status of the Social Security and Medicare programs paints an alarming picture of the future of two of America's most indispensable entitlement programs.</p><p>VERMA: We need to change the trajectory of health care cost growth to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>CORKE: The report summarizes that at current projections Medicare's Hospital Insurance Fund will only be able to afford 89 percent of its total cost in just seven years. And that Social Security program costs are likely to exceed total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982.</p><p>While Medicare and specifically Medicare for all have been the subject of a fierce political debate among Democrats this year, Trump administration officials say the program is also increasingly vulnerable. With Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar writing in a statement that instead of trying to expand Medicare into quote, \"a universal entitlement that even covers wealthy Americans of working age, we need to fulfill Medicare's promise to our seniors.\"</p><p>SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The American people want and we are going to deliver a Medicare for all single-payer system.</p><p>CORKE: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders headlines a large field of 2020 Democrat contenders who back some form of Medicare for all with Sanders specifically advocating a single-payer system --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're going to will hurt your Social Security so badly.</p><p>CORKE: According to the report the news is equally bleak for Social Security. It forecast that its funds could be depleted by 2035 and that could lead to reductions in payouts to retirees and other beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Bret -- the real concern at Social Security offices like the one behind me is that with so many baby boomers nearing retirement age and soon to be drawing off the system, it is paramount that something be done to address the shortfall.</p><p>For its part the White House is asking congressional lawmakers to do something about it sooner rather than later -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Now to politics. Former vice president Joe Biden will formally declare his candidacy for the top job Thursday. That is a departure from the earlier plan of a Wednesday rollout and it comes as most polls indicate Biden leads the field of which he's not yet an official member.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy tells us where things stand right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The long time politician who loves quoting Irish poets.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, I can't let a comment go by without quoting an Irish poet.</p><p>DOOCY: The third time is a charm. Joe Biden will announce another White House campaign with an online video Thursday, then a Pittsburgh rally Monday. The 2020 bid follows a campaign in 1988 cut short by a plagiarism scandal and a campaign in 2008 that ended after the Iowa caucus.</p><p>BIDEN: And let me make something clear to you, I ain't going away.</p><p>DOOCY: Now the 76-year-old is set to become 2020's 20th candidate.</p><p>HARRIS: Come on in. The water is warm -- Joe.</p><p>DOOCY: Kamala Harris is also pitching executive action on guns.</p><p>HARRIS: Upon being elected I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws. And if they fail to do it then I will take executive action.</p><p>DOOCY: So what has changed since Biden was Barack Obama's vice president when days after the Boston marathon bombing he condemned the culprit.</p><p>BIDEN: Two, twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis here in Boston.</p><p>DOOCY: Now, the Democratic front runner among declared candidates believes the surviving Boston bomber should be able to vote from jail.</p><p>SANDERS: The right to vote is inherent to our democracy.

He's more than twice the age of surging South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg who just updated his Web site with policy positions but approached accusations that he has pushed a hate hoax by attacking Mike Pence with caution.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not a master fisherman but I know bait when I see it and I'm not going to take it.</p><p>DOOCY: Joe Biden will bring less of a filter even when facing controversy.</p><p>BIDEN: By the way, he gave me permission to touch him, all right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: As Biden's unwanted touching scandal grew Barack Obama never publicly defended him and now as Biden reportedly plans to roll out a long list of high-profile endorsements, it is not clear Obama will be one of them -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Peter -- thank you.</p><p>We are happy to announce Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg will appear on a Fox News town hall meeting next month.

But over politics and eggs, the governor made clear he is seriously considering challenging President Trump.</p><p>HOGAN: I'm not interested in just running to hurt the President, bruise the President. I'm out here talking about things that I think are important. I care about the future of my party.</p><p>FISHER: But the Republican National Committee does not care for any Republican trying to take down President Trump including former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld who officially entered the race last week.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: They have the right to jump in and lose. That's fine. They will lose horribly. I mean the President has 93 percent approval in our party.</p><p>FISHER: In January the Republican National Committee passed a resolution of undivided support for President Trump effectively merging the party and his reelection team into a single unit.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes. I think this goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016. I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the President. I mean I think it was wrong what the DNC did but this is much worse.</p><p>FISHER: Today Hogan accused President Trump of trying to commit a crime, obstruction of justice. And he slammed other Republicans for being too afraid to speak out.</p><p>Governor Weld agrees.</p><p>BILL WELD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They are all petrified of the President because they know he can't control his emotions and he's given to temper tantrums and being vindictive.</p><p>FISHER: Hogan is aware that after today he could become President Trump's next target. But Hogan believes he is uniquely qualified to sustain that kind of attack.</p><p>HOGAN: I battled cancer for 18 months. I can probably take him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER: But could he upend more than a century of history.

Justices they heard arguments today right now.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @NIGHT\" Shannon Bream tells us what was said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE HO, ACLU VOTING RIGHTS PROJECT: It is not about a line on a form. It is about whether or not everyone in America counts.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: But therein lies the problem the nine justices must untangle. Whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross overstepped his authority by adding a citizenship question to the 2020 sentence.</p><p>Critics of the move say it will discourage people from completing the forms predicting it will lead to an undercount of primarily minority populations. Today several of the liberal-leaning justices said the administration can get the information it is seeking from other government databases.</p><p>Of Ross' decision Justice Sotomayor said, quote, \"This seems like he thought of something, I want to add a citizenship question.\" Adding, \"This is a solution in search of a problem. I've got to find a problem that fits what I want to do.\"</p><p>But a number of the more conservative justices noted that the citizenship question has been included on various census forms nearly uniformly between 1820 and 1950. And in a more limited way since then.</p><p>Justice Kavanaugh noting that the statute passed by Congress gives the Commerce Secretary enormous discretion in putting together the census form. Asked why if Congress objects it hasn't already outlawed the question. Quote, \"Why doesn't Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?\"</p><p>Opponents traced the entire debate back to the issue of immigration and claimed that the administration's sole purpose in asking about citizenship is to silence people in the U.S. illegally.

And I think as a sovereign nation we have that right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Well, a decision from the court is due by late June and time is of the essence.

You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background. Thought we'd show you what was happening.</p><p>In the meantime, a new legal challenge for embattled actor Jussie Smollett tonight. Two of the men involved in what police say was a faked hate crime attacker are now throwing rhetorical punches at Smollett's lawyers. Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin has details tonight from this story that is ever- changing in Chicago. Good evening, Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. One way or the other we might still see actor Jussie Smollett in a real-life courtroom drama. He is facing a lawsuit from the city of Chicago, and he may very well be called as a witness in the federal lawsuit that was filed today.</p><p>However, the actor was not named as a defendant. The suit does say the attack was a hoax conceived and directed by Jussie Smollett right down to the use of a noose, bleach, and shouts that this is MAGA correspondent from the attackers. The lawsuit is directed as his high-powered legal team, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian. It claims after charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett, Geragos and Glandian did the rounds on news programs and podcasts. Lawyers for the Osundairo brothers say Geragos and Glandian repeatedly made false, reprehensible, and damaging statements. The brothers claim their reputation and personal training business were damaged. They also suffered emotional distress.</p><p>Today attorney Gloria Schmidt said the two wannabe actors followed the direction of a successful actor, and now they want to clear their names.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLORIA SCHMIDT, OSUNDAIRO BROTHERS ATTORNEY: They were asked to do something by a friend who they trusted, and at the end of the day that friend betrayed their trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN: Geragos and Glandian hit back. Part of their statement reads, \"This so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated.\" Geragos says the suit will be thrown out, it lacks legal footing. The brothers are seeking an unspecified amount of money and legal costs. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Mike Tobin in Chicago. We'll follow this. Mike, thanks.</p><p>Meantime, Mexico is trying to show the U.S. it is getting more serious about stopping Central American migrants from reaching the southern border of the U.S. Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt looks at a major move that took place Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Migrants fought back with sticks against what appeared to be a concerted effort by Mexican authorities to send a signal they will no longer be so accommodating to the thousands coming from Central America and heading to the U.S. border. It was clearly a well-planned operation with police officers, according to A.P. reporters on scene, suggesting a group of hundreds of migrants take a break in the shade, as others from the approximately 3,000 strong caravan moved on. Then as the trailing group rested, the Mexican authorities moved in. Large numbers of officers grabbing men, women, and children, taking them away to waiting buses. More than 350 were picked up in total according to Mexico's National Migration Institute, which blamed the violence on a small group of aggressive migrants. Journalists traveling with a caravans have also reportedly that migrants are getting a far less hospitable welcome in the Mexican towns they travel through than was the case several months ago.</p><p>KEVIN MCALEENAN, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Any solution we're going to have to reduce this flow is going to rely on Mexican authorities to take a stronger action, frankly, against people that are exploiting migrants.</p><p>HUNT: Customs and Border Protection officials also shared this video with FOX News today which they say was shot on the Arizona-Mexico border on Saturday, and shows heavily armed smugglers escorting a Guatemalan woman and boy into the U.S. CBP says it is concerned to see those sort of weapons now being used by human smugglers right on the border.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNT: The woman and her son were quickly detained by CBP agents. The armed smugglers are still at large somewhere in Mexico. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>Joe Biden pushes back his entry into the 2020 race by a day, and President Trump may be getting another Republican challenger. We'll talk about it all and the 2020 election when the panel joins me after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE: The impeachment proceedings are up to the House. They are going to have to make that decision.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think he has made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment. I'm also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Every person in the Senate and the House, they should take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to see about that investigation. We'll see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: \"Impeachment\" the word of the day for the town hall with the 2020 candidates, as you look at a list, a ever-growing of people getting into the 2020 race. It is a lot easier, it seems, for them to say, sure, go ahead and impeach President Trump, than it is for House Democrats to get to that conclusion and the logistical hurdles ahead.</p><p>As you look at the polls new out today, Monmouth poll, has Joe Biden is in the lead and you see Bernie Sanders in second. Pete Buttigieg, they mayor, look at that, less that one percent to eight percent just in a short time. And then if you look at Iowa, obviously the first stop the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden also leading there, the margin a little bit smaller, and Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in third.</p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\" Jonah, we've had this kind of launch, non-launch for Joe Biden. He was going to go Wednesday, now it's Thursday. We don't have a lot of details on what it looks like, but he's clearly still leading in some of these big pools.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": He is. And I think he is well-positioned. I don't usually give a lot advice to Democrats, but if I were him, I would come out, I would announce and immediately take dead aim at Bernie Sanders and say this is a two-person race. I'm the grown up. I'm a liberal, but I'm not a socialist. The party will go down in flames if we pursue Bernie's path. It will make everybody else look small. He is basically the only guy in a position who can do that.</p><p>And I think that one of the things we see is that a lot of the Democratic primary people, they think that basically Democratic Twitter is the actual Democratic electorate, and it's not. And he is one of the only people who is positioned to actually reach out to the traditional Democratic voter.</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, you do wonder, though, about the launch or decision to launch and what transpired there. All we are told is that something will happen Thursday, a video launch, and then there's a Monday event in Pittsburgh. I don't know what happens between Thursday and Monday, but it's interesting.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Originally it was supposed to be Wednesday, tomorrow, as you know. And one of the reasons they delayed it, I'm being told, is Charlottesville. A lot of people thought at first that might be a good place for the former vice president to announce, but then there was some kickback, people felt it was disrespectful, they decided not to do it, and that delayed them some.</p><p>There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track. But I and other Democrats are not worried yet. He is still leading in almost every poll, and he hasn't yet announced.</p><p>BAIER: Charlie, a lot of that has to do with name recognition, a lot of that has to do with eight years as vice president, and you wonder how Joe Biden is going to compete with a pretty energetic and obviously voluminous candidate spread on the Democratic side.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years. He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time. And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything.</p><p>And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington. And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much. And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them. The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess.</p><p>BAIER: It doesn't seem like President Trump has settled on a nickname yet. He had one percent Joe for past races, then he had sleepy Joe. We don't know where he will end up.</p><p>Jonah, voting rights for prisoners came up last night in the town halls and seemed to be a little bit of a separation. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should people convicted of sexual assault, the Boston Marathon bomber, should they be able to vote?</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: While incarcerated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: No, I don't think so.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do believe that even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think we should have that conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Is this an issue that Iowa and New Hampshire cares about?</p><p>GOLDBERG: It is a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit. Buttigieg gave the exact right answer, and Bernie Sanders' position I find utterly baffling. Look, when you go to this thing called prison, you have lots of rights that are curtailed. The freedom of assembly, freedom of speech all sorts of things. One of the others ones happens to be freedom to vote. It is another thing entirely when you pay back your debt to society about whether or not you should have your voting rights restored. But the idea that Bernie Sanders is getting out like free candy these Willie Horton type issues where he wants the worst terrorists in America to be able to vote, it's bizarre to me.</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, it's one thing to be talking about Medicare for all and the details of that and then the Green New Deal and how you're going to pay for it, but it seems that that, prisoners voting, Electoral College, seem on the outskirts.</p><p>MARSHALL: Definitely. In dark corners, if you will, Democrats like myself are saying, why are they even making this an issue? Mayor Pete got it right. When somebody commits a crime, and I think most Democrats feel this way, they lose their rights as a free individual. Now, when they get out of prison, if they get those rights restored that's a whole other conversation. We've seen that. There are people left and right that can agree to that. And this is a can of worms that a Democrat doesn't need to open because we have so many other areas. The only good thing about this, Bret, is this is one area where they all did not agree on this issue.</p><p>BAIER: All right, finally, you have William Weld on the Republican side throwing his name in the hat, an uphill battle obviously. Now you have potentially the Maryland governor. Take a listen to Larry Hogan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN, (R) MARYLAND: I think it goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016. I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the president. I think it was wrong what the DNC did, but this is much worse.</p><p>To change the rules and to insist 100 percent royalty to the dear leader, it just didn't sound very much like the Republican Party that I grew up in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They have the right to jump in and lose. That's fine. They will lose horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Charlie, you don't go to politics in New Hampshire unless you are really thinking about it.</p><p>HURT: I think that is right. And by the way, I think it is a great thing. I think anybody wants to get in and stir the pot is great. But the bottom line remains, the president remains one of the most popular Republicans among Republicans in recent times, and he's going to be the nominee. With Bernie Sanders, I'm calling it the 50-state strategy to make sure that even Massachusetts votes for Republicans. With crazy ideas like letting the Boston Marathon bomber's vote, a guy like President Trump is in a good position I think to win reelection.</p><p>BAIER: By the way, Alex Jones agrees with you behind the gate here with his microphone. Panel, stand by. Next up, a grim outlook for Medicare and Social Security.</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES: Health care spending in America is on an unsustainable path. The Medicare Trustees reported that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you take Social Security, it's 25 percent of the federal budget, and it's growing faster than the GDP. You add in Medicare and Medicaid and now you're up to about 55 percent, 55 percent of the entire federal budget.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: We saw some disturbing numbers from the Trustees report. As you heard Medicare seven years from now depleted in the hospital insurance pond. That happens then Medicare Part A will only be able to cover 89 percent of the cost for hospital stays and related services, and that will go down to 77 percent in 2046. On Social Security, total costs projected to exceed its total income including interests for the first time since 1982. The bottom line is something has to be done to save these programs if we are going to. We are back with a panel. Charlie?</p><p>HURT: Yes. This is a slow-rolling catastrophe, and it's not something that we haven't known for a long time. Obviously, people like Paul Ryan have been talking about it for a long time. President Trump obviously ran in 2016 vowing not to touch these programs. Obviously, that was a smart move back then, but the fact remains that they are going consultants and something has to be done about it.</p><p>The one good thing I think that has happened is that it's going to be a lot easier to fix these programs with a very good economy like the one we have right now than if we were facing this catastrophe and had a bad economy.</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, it doesn't seem like anybody is taking this baton.</p><p>MARSHALL: They knew about this at least a year ago. Maybe we have some better numbers today. But look, you have baby boomers that are going to enter the system, more people, and you have people with a double whammy right now, because you have some individuals, my mom is one of them, who rely largely on their Social Security to live. How on earth are they going to make up any kind of a gap with Medicare if they can't afford any secondary insurance beyond what they are already paying? This is something where the left and right, Democrats and Republicans, not only can work together but they have to, and they have to do it before it's on the brink of insolvency.</p><p>BAIER: But the difference is pretty stark. The White House reaction is this report is grim, but Medicare for all is not the answer.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And they are right. The thing is the Trump administration has basically ignored the problem with entitlements while the Democrats are proposing things to make them much, much worse. The simple fact is that we live in an economy where Social Security was created when we had something like over a dozen workers for every retiree. Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65. Now it's two-to-one per retiree. We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people. It is not sustainable. It has got to be ripped up from the ground and figured out. You have to grandfather in the people who are recipients now but then fix it for the coming generation. That is nowhere on the horizon for what the Democrats are proposing, and the Republicans are just ignoring it.</p><p>BAIER: Charlie, Medicare for all seems to be a litmus test for a lot of Democrats running this year.</p><p>HURT: Yes, and unfortunately the idea of Medicare for all on top of the problems that we're facing right now is the typical government answer, more centralized governance from Washington. That is the whole problem in the first place. Making Medicare, expanding it massively, isn't going to fix it. It's going to break it.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, thank you.</p><p>Just moments ago, the president tweeted, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they are actually talking impeachment? Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems? No collusion!\" We obviously lead with that news tonight on the newscast tonight. The president is welcome. We're here a lot of Tuesdays down here on the North Lawn. Any time.</p><p>When we come back, one brave police officer confronts a situation that could really stink things up.</p><p>BAIER: Nothing like a sunset at the White House.</p><p>Finally tonight, Police Officer Ron Kaszas in South Bend, Indiana, managed to pull off quite the rescue for one lucky skunk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I bet you this will go viral.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at those South Bend police officers. They are always doing something good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The skunk had a cup on its head, in case you didn't see that. There you go.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019042301cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYH-JFC1-JB20-G018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Medicare and Medicaid</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Census</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Public Health &amp;

This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>I'm Bret Baier reporting tonight from the White House where the Trump administration continues to push back on impeachment narratives coming from Capitol Hill and from the left as the top polling Democrat prepares to officially enter the race.</p><p>But first despite the discord here in Washington post-Mueller report, the markets have taken that report in stride.  And tonight your 401(k) is probably a lot healthier than it has been in a while.</p><p>A big day on Wall Street as the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at record highs, recovering all the ground they lost in nose dive late last year.  The Dow had a strong performance today as well netting 145 closing in on its own record close.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 26.  The NASDAQ surged 106.</p><p>The market is buoyed by better-than-expected numbers from a number of companies today.</p><p>Let's get some analysis from Susan Li of the Fox Business Network.  She joins us from New York.  Good evening -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.</p><p>The bull market continues in 2019, surprising many that thought it was coming to an end especially after a dismal December.  The broader index -- the S&amp;P 500 surpassing its last record high struck in September last year.  It is also the 81st record under President Trump.  The NASDAQ hitting its 96th new record in this administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  He ended the war on business.  He's ended the war on success.  He believes strongly that if you do well and succeed you should be rewarded, not punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI:  What has been powering the rally?  The Federal Reserve's signaling that the Central Bank is not likely to raise interest rates this year.  Also signs that the U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and companies earnings that continue to defy gravity.  And that is despite bears' (ph) calls for a drop in corporate profits the first three months of the year.</p><p>Big tech has been one of the most favorite trade so far with big gains for Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft.  Virtually every sector has seen an advance with stocks big and small joining in on the rally.</p><p>A strong stock market and a growing U.S. economy that the President doesn't think gets enough media attention.  President Trump tweeting, \"In the old days if you are president and you had a good economy you are basically immune from criticism.\"</p><p>Now this week is another big test with tech giants Facebook and Microsoft reporting results tomorrow and first quarter GDP expected on Friday.  That is a big one, economist forecasting somewhere between 1.5 percent to maybe 2.5 percent growth -- a strong bounce back after a government shutdown to start off the year -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Susan Li in New York.  Susan,  thanks.</p><p>President Trump met with the CEO of Twitter here at the White House today.  The social media site has been a frequent target of the President's wrath but is also a primary communication tool for him.  And case in point, he just tweeted about the meeting last hour.  \"Great meeting this afternoon at the White House with @Jack from @Twitter.  Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform and the world of social media in general.  Look forward to keeping an open dialogue.\"  As you heard Susan mention Twitter was up nearly 16 percent today on the markets because of a positive earnings report.</p><p>Meantime one of the President's senior is communicating his thoughts about the ramifications of the Mueller report.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts begins there here on the north lawn.  Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, good evening to you.</p><p>It was one of those rare moments where we got to hear the first son-in-law Jared Kushner speak at length.  It was at the Time 100 Forum where Kushner had plenty to say about the Mueller report and the path that Congress is now taking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW:  All these people thought Trump was going to lose.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Weighing in for the first time on the Mueller report, Jared Kushner downplayed Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election insisting the real damage was done by the ensuing investigation.</p><p>KUSHNER:  You look at, you know, what Russia did, you know, buying some Facebook ads and tried to (INAUDIBLE) and do it.  And it's a terrible thing.  But I think the investigations and all the speculation that has happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Kushner said when Mueller came calling he was the first one to raise his hand to cooperate.  Spending hours with the special counsel, hours more in congressional committees and he fully embraced at least one of Mueller's findings.</p><p>KUSHNER:  The one thing the Mueller report was very conclusive on is there was absolutely no coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign.  And everything that the President has been saying, everything that I've been saying for two years has now been fully authenticated.</p><p>ROBERTS:  But Democrats want to know a lot more about the other part of the Mueller report -- presidential efforts to thwart the investigation.  The White House is deliberating whether to allow former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 21st.  The former chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, believes McGahn will testify with conditions.</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  I expect him to come, but I expect him to insist on having people behind him that can advise him as to when to answer a question and when a privilege might be appropriate.</p><p>ROBERTS:  The White House has already advised one former staffer to ignore a congressional subpoena.  Carl Kline, the former chief of White House personnel security was told not to show up for his scheduled deposition to the House Oversight Committee today.

But at the same time as all these congressional investigations are heating up President Trump will have a chance to get out of Washington for a while.</p><p>Just days after he returns from a trip to Japan to meet with the new emperor he will head off to the U.K. to meet with the Queen then cross the channel into Normandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  And he'll have a decision -- how much to fight, how much not to fight Congress.</p><p>ROBERTS:  I have a feeling they're going to fight all -- most if not all of these subpoenas.  I think the Kline subpoena fight is a good indication of which way they are going.</p><p>BAIER:  All right.  John -- thank you.</p><p>Well, senior officials at the Treasury Department are still trying to determine if a request for the President's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee is legal.  The Department missed today's deadline to turn over six years of the President's records.  The Treasury says it is waiting on the Justice Department to issue a report on the legality.  That conclusion will not be given to Treasury until May 6th.  The Treasury Secretary insisting the law does not allow Congress to set a deadline for the response.</p><p>Meantime a new alarm bells are sounding in Washington tonight over the long-term viability of the nation's bedrock social safety net programs for older Americans.  We first told you last night about a new government report stating that Medicare will become insolvent in just seven years if nothing is done.  And trustees write that Social Security is in trouble too, following close behind on insolvency.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Kevin Corke looks at where we are and what it means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  The Medicare trustees reported that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>The 2019 status of the Social Security and Medicare programs paints an alarming picture of the future of two of America's most indispensable entitlement programs.</p><p>VERMA:  We need to change the trajectory of health care cost growth to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>CORKE:  The report summarizes that at current projections Medicare's Hospital Insurance Fund will only be able to afford 89 percent of its total cost in just seven years.  And that Social Security program costs are likely to exceed total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982.</p><p>While Medicare and specifically Medicare for all have been the subject of a fierce political debate among Democrats this year, Trump administration officials say the program is also increasingly vulnerable.

Former vice president Joe Biden will formally declare his candidacy for the top job Thursday.

But over politics and eggs, the governor made clear he is seriously considering challenging President Trump.</p><p>HOGAN:  I'm not interested in just running to hurt the President, bruise the President.  I'm out here talking about things that I think are important.  I care about the future of my party.</p><p>FISHER:  But the Republican National Committee does not care for any Republican trying to take down President Trump including former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld who officially entered the race last week.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.  I mean the President has 93 percent approval in our party.</p><p>FISHER:  In January the Republican National Committee passed a resolution of undivided support for President Trump effectively merging the party and his reelection team into a single unit.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes.  I think this goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the President.  I mean I think it was wrong what the DNC did but this is much worse.</p><p>FISHER:  Today Hogan accused President Trump of trying to commit a crime, obstruction of justice.  And he slammed other Republicans for being too afraid to speak out.</p><p>Governor Weld agrees.</p><p>BILL WELD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They are all petrified of the President because they know he can't control his emotions and he's given to temper tantrums and being vindictive.</p><p>FISHER:  Hogan is aware that after today he could become President Trump's next target.

Justices they heard arguments today right now.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @NIGHT\" Shannon Bream tells us what was said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE HO, ACLU VOTING RIGHTS PROJECT:  It is not about a line on a form.  It is about whether or not everyone in America counts.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:  But therein lies the problem the nine justices must untangle.  Whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross overstepped his authority by adding a citizenship question to the 2020 sentence.</p><p>Critics of the move say it will discourage people from completing the forms predicting it will lead to an undercount of primarily minority populations.  Today several of the liberal-leaning justices said the administration can get the information it is seeking from other government databases.</p><p>Of Ross' decision Justice Sotomayor said, quote, \"This seems like he thought of something, I want to add a citizenship question.\"  Adding, \"This is a solution in search of a problem.  I've got to find a problem that fits what I want to do.\"</p><p>But a number of the more conservative justices noted that the citizenship question has been included on various census forms nearly uniformly between 1820 and 1950.  And in a more limited way since then.</p><p>Justice Kavanaugh noting that the statute passed by Congress gives the Commerce Secretary enormous discretion in putting together the census form.  Asked why if Congress objects it hasn't already outlawed the question.  Quote, \"Why doesn't Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?\"</p><p>Opponents traced the entire debate back to the issue of immigration and claimed that the administration's sole purpose in asking about citizenship is to silence people in the U.S. illegally.  The administration says the President's priorities are both legal and fair.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We want to know who's in this country.

Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin has details tonight from this story that is ever-changing in Chicago.  Good evening, Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  One way or the other we might still see actor Jussie Smollett in a real-life courtroom drama.  He is facing a lawsuit from the city of Chicago, and he may very well be called as a witness in the federal lawsuit that was filed today.</p><p>However, the actor was not named as a defendant.  The suit does say the attack was a hoax conceived and directed by Jussie Smollett right down to the use of a noose, bleach, and shouts that this is MAGA correspondent from the attackers.  The lawsuit is directed as his high-powered legal team, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian.  It claims after charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett, Geragos and Glandian did the rounds on news programs and podcasts.  Lawyers for the Osundairo brothers say Geragos and Glandian repeatedly made false, reprehensible, and damaging statements.

Mike, thanks.</p><p>Meantime, Mexico is trying to show the U.S. it is getting more serious about stopping Central American migrants from reaching the southern border of the U.S.  Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt looks at a major move that took place Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Migrants fought back with sticks against what appeared to be a concerted effort by Mexican authorities to send a signal they will no longer be so accommodating to the thousands coming from Central America and heading to the U.S. border.  It was clearly a well-planned operation with police officers, according to A.P. reporters on scene, suggesting a group of hundreds of migrants take a break in the shade, as others from the approximately 3,000 strong caravan moved on.  Then as the trailing group rested, the Mexican authorities moved in.  Large numbers of officers grabbing men, women, and children, taking them away to waiting buses.  More than 350 were picked up in total according to Mexico's National Migration Institute, which blamed the violence on a small group of aggressive migrants.  Journalists traveling with a caravans have also reportedly that migrants are getting a far less hospitable welcome in the Mexican towns they travel through than was the case several months ago.</p><p>KEVIN MCALEENAN, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  Any solution we're going to have to reduce this flow is going to rely on Mexican authorities to take a stronger action, frankly, against people that are exploiting migrants.</p><p>HUNT:  Customs and Border Protection officials also shared this video with FOX News today which they say was shot on the Arizona-Mexico border on Saturday, and shows heavily armed smugglers escorting a Guatemalan woman and boy into the U.S.  CBP says it is concerned to see those sort of weapons now being used by human smugglers right on the border.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNT:  The woman and her son were quickly detained by CBP agents.

I'm also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  Every person in the Senate and the House, they should take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I want to see about that investigation.  We'll see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  \"Impeachment\" the word of the day for the town hall with the 2020 candidates, as you look at a list, a ever-growing of people getting into the 2020 race.  It is a lot easier, it seems, for them to say, sure, go ahead and impeach President Trump, than it is for House Democrats to get to that conclusion and the logistical hurdles ahead.</p><p>As you look at the polls new out today, Monmouth poll, has Joe Biden is in the lead and you see Bernie Sanders in second.  Pete Buttigieg, they mayor, look at that, less that one percent to eight percent just in a short time.  And then if you look at Iowa, obviously the first stop the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden also leading there, the margin a little bit smaller, and Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in third.</p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\"  Jonah, we've had this kind of launch, non-launch for Joe Biden.  He was going to go Wednesday, now it's Thursday.  We don't have a lot of details on what it looks like, but he's clearly still leading in some of these big pools.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\":  He is.  And I think he is well-positioned.  I don't usually give a lot advice to Democrats, but if I were him, I would come out, I would announce and immediately take dead aim at Bernie Sanders and say this is a two-person race.  I'm the grown up.  I'm a liberal, but I'm not a socialist.  The party will go down in flames if we pursue Bernie's path.  It will make everybody else look small.  He is basically the only guy in a position who can do that.</p><p>And I think that one of the things we see is that a lot of the Democratic primary people, they think that basically Democratic Twitter is the actual Democratic electorate, and it's not.  And he is one of the only people who is positioned to actually reach out to the traditional Democratic voter.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, you do wonder, though, about the launch or decision to launch and what transpired there.  All we are told is that something will happen Thursday, a video launch, and then there's a Monday event in Pittsburgh.  I don't know what happens between Thursday and Monday, but it's interesting.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Originally it was supposed to be Wednesday, tomorrow, as you know.  And one of the reasons they delayed it, I'm being told, is Charlottesville.  A lot of people thought at first that might be a good place for the former vice president to announce, but then there was some kickback, people felt it was disrespectful, they decided not to do it, and that delayed them some.</p><p>There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track.  But I and other Democrats are not worried yet.  He is still leading in almost every poll, and he hasn't yet announced.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, a lot of that has to do with name recognition, a lot of that has to do with eight years as vice president, and you wonder how Joe Biden is going to compete with a pretty energetic and obviously voluminous candidate spread on the Democratic side.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years.  He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time.  And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything.</p><p>And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington.  And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much.  And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them.  The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess.</p><p>BAIER:  It doesn't seem like President Trump has settled on a nickname yet.  He had one percent Joe for past races, then he had sleepy Joe.  We don't know where he will end up.</p><p>Jonah, voting rights for prisoners came up last night in the town halls and seemed to be a little bit of a separation.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should people convicted of sexual assault, the Boston Marathon bomber, should they be able to vote?</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  While incarcerated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do believe that even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think we should have that conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Is this an issue that Iowa and New Hampshire cares about?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  It is a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.  Buttigieg gave the exact right answer, and Bernie Sanders' position I find utterly baffling.  Look, when you go to this thing called prison, you have lots of rights that are curtailed.  The freedom of assembly, freedom of speech all sorts of things.  One of the others ones happens to be freedom to vote.  It is another thing entirely when you pay back your debt to society about whether or not you should have your voting rights restored.  But the idea that Bernie Sanders is getting out like free candy these Willie Horton type issues where he wants the worst terrorists in America to be able to vote, it's bizarre to me.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it's one thing to be talking about Medicare for all and the details of that and then the Green New Deal and how you're going to pay for it, but it seems that that, prisoners voting, Electoral College, seem on the outskirts.</p><p>MARSHALL:  Definitely.  In dark corners, if you will, Democrats like myself are saying, why are they even making this an issue?  Mayor Pete got it right.  When somebody commits a crime, and I think most Democrats feel this way, they lose their rights as a free individual.  Now, when they get out of prison, if they get those rights restored that's a whole other conversation.  We've seen that.  There are people left and right that can agree to that.  And this is a can of worms that a Democrat doesn't need to open because we have so many other areas.  The only good thing about this, Bret, is this is one area where they all did not agree on this issue.</p><p>BAIER:  All right, finally, you have William Weld on the Republican side throwing his name in the hat, an uphill battle obviously.  Now you have potentially the Maryland governor.  Take a listen to Larry Hogan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN, (R) MARYLAND:  I think it goes way beyond what the DNC did back in 2016.  I think they have taken way more steps to try to stack the deck in favor of the president.  I think it was wrong what the DNC did, but this is much worse.</p><p>To change the rules and to insist 100 percent royalty to the dear leader, it just didn't sound very much like the Republican Party that I grew up in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have the right to jump in and lose.  That's fine.  They will lose horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, you don't go to politics in New Hampshire unless you are really thinking about it.</p><p>HURT:  I think that is right.  And by the way, I think it is a great thing.  I think anybody wants to get in and stir the pot is great.  But the bottom line remains, the president remains one of the most popular Republicans among Republicans in recent times, and he's going to be the nominee.  With Bernie Sanders, I'm calling it the 50-state strategy to make sure that even Massachusetts votes for Republicans.  With crazy ideas like letting the Boston Marathon bomber's vote, a guy like President Trump is in a good position I think to win reelection.</p><p>BAIER:  By the way, Alex Jones agrees with you behind the gate here with his microphone.  Panel, stand by.  Next up, a grim outlook for Medicare and Social Security.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SEEMA VERMA, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES:  Health care spending in America is on an unsustainable path.  The Medicare Trustees reported that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2026.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you take Social Security, it's 25 percent of the federal budget, and it's growing faster than the GDP.  You add in Medicare and Medicaid and now you're up to about 55 percent, 55 percent of the entire federal budget.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  We saw some disturbing numbers from the Trustees report.  As you heard Medicare seven years from now depleted in the hospital insurance pond.  That happens then Medicare Part A will only be able to cover 89 percent of the cost for hospital stays and related services, and that will go down to 77 percent in 2046.  On Social Security, total costs projected to exceed its total income including interests for the first time since 1982.  The bottom line is something has to be done to save these programs if we are going to.  We are back with a panel.  Charlie?</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  This is a slow-rolling catastrophe, and it's not something that we haven't known for a long time.  Obviously, people like Paul Ryan have been talking about it for a long time.  President Trump obviously ran in 2016 vowing not to touch these programs.  Obviously, that was a smart move back then, but the fact remains that they are going consultants and something has to be done about it.</p><p>The one good thing I think that has happened is that it's going to be a lot easier to fix these programs with a very good economy like the one we have right now than if we were facing this catastrophe and had a bad economy.</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, it doesn't seem like anybody is taking this baton.</p><p>MARSHALL:  They knew about this at least a year ago.  Maybe we have some better numbers today.  But look, you have baby boomers that are going to enter the system, more people, and you have people with a double whammy right now, because you have some individuals, my mom is one of them, who rely largely on their Social Security to live.  How on earth are they going to make up any kind of a gap with Medicare if they can't afford any secondary insurance beyond what they are already paying?  This is something where the left and right, Democrats and Republicans, not only can work together but they have to, and they have to do it before it's on the brink of insolvency.</p><p>BAIER:  But the difference is pretty stark.  The White House reaction is this report is grim, but Medicare for all is not the answer.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And they are right.  The thing is the Trump administration has basically ignored the problem with entitlements while the Democrats are proposing things to make them much, much worse.  The simple fact is that we live in an economy where Social Security was created when we had something like over a dozen workers for every retiree.  Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65.  Now it's two-to-one per retiree.  We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people.  It is not sustainable.  It has got to be ripped up from the ground and figured out.  You have to grandfather in the people who are recipients now but then fix it for the coming generation.  That is nowhere on the horizon for what the Democrats are proposing, and the Republicans are just ignoring it.</p><p>BAIER:  Charlie, Medicare for all seems to be a litmus test for a lot of Democrats running this year.</p><p>HURT:  Yes, and unfortunately the idea of Medicare for all on top of the problems that we're facing right now is the typical government answer, more centralized governance from Washington.  That is the whole problem in the first place.  Making Medicare, expanding it massively, isn't going to fix it.  It's going to break it.</p><p>BAIER:  Panel, thank you.</p><p>Just moments ago, the president tweeted, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they are actually talking impeachment?  Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems?  No collusion!\" We obviously lead with that news tonight on the newscast tonight.  The president is welcome.  We're here a lot of Tuesdays down here on the North Lawn.  Any time.</p><p>When we come back, one brave police officer confronts a situation that could really stink things up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Nothing like a sunset at the White House.</p><p>Finally tonight, Police Officer Ron Kaszas in South Bend, Indiana, managed to pull off quite the rescue for one lucky skunk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I bet you this will go viral.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not in the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at those South Bend police officers.  They are always doing something good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The skunk had a cup on its head, in case you didn't see that.  There you go.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That is it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.  \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2213260913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-79N1-DY0W-410H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7410\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
