My name is Josh Resnik, and I'm the publisher of CQ Roll Call, as well as the emcee for today's event. </p><p>Before we kick off the discussion, I'd like to take a moment to set the stage for this evenings dialogue. Today, we live in a world of rapid change. Every industry is going through turbulence and transformation, largely driven by technology, but also by political and governmental changes as well, and finances is clearly not immune. Technological changes are upending the industry. Today, we call those changes by the collective name of FinTech. But as Georgetown's own Professor Chris Brummer has said many times, in 5 or 10 years what is now called FinTech will simply be the new world of finance. </p><p>At CQ Roll Call for the past 75 years, our publications have been leaders in unbiased, nonpartisan, legislative, and regulatory analysis. And now, in partnership with Professor Brummer, we're launching new coverage of FinTech's technological and regulatory impacts. We'll be teaming up with regulators, academics, and industry leaders to elevate the public's understanding of modern finance. We've been excited to partner with Professor Brummer on this coverage, including our new podcast, FinTech Beat, which went live on Apple today. And we're also delighted to be partnering with Georgetown Law School and the Institute of International Economic Law on tonight's event. </p><p>So let's dive in and get started with our panel. Professor Brummer will be moderating tonight's discussion. In addition to being a professor here at Georgetown, as well as the co-founder of FinTech Beat, Chris is also a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Subcommittee on Virtual Currencies and a member of the Consultative Working Group for the European Securities and Markets Authority's Financial Innovation Standing Committee. </p><p>We're fortunate to have some of FinTech's leading experts joining us on our panel this evening. So please join me in welcoming Brad Carr, senior director of Digital Finance at the Institute of International Finance. Brad leads the IIF's analysis on technology and innovation issues, including data regulations, reg tech, cloud, and distributed ledger technology, and the IIF's studies on the adoption of machine learning within the financial sector. </p><p>Next, we have Amy Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Prior to joining the chamber, Amy advised financial institutions, blockchain-based companies, marketplace lenders, investors, and innovators regarding compliance obligations under financial services laws. </p><p>Our third panelist is Tim Swanson, founder and director of Research at Post Oak Labs. Tim is currently an advisor to Elm Labs, Clear Maddox, and Bloxier (SP), and was an advisor to Hyperledger. </p><p>Please join me in welcoming our panelists and CQ Roll Call and Georgetown's own Chris Brummer to the stage. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRUMMER: So thank you so much. Afterwards, we're going to have a--a brief opportunity for a--a Q&amp;A, both with our panelists, and also, obviously, for our--our--our keynote discussion later. </p><p>There's nothing like having an event after alcohol and having some introductory drinks. And hopefully, this will--will help to get the most forthright and interesting conversation from all of our panelists. </p><p>RESNIK: We--we didn't get to do the drinking though. </p><p>BRUMMER: Oh, yeah. Well, fortunately, I did. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We prepared the audience for us. </p><p>BRUMMER: I guess that's the most important thing. </p><p>So I guess I'll start with--with you, Tim. You know, some of the biggest news recently, particularly when you're talking about cryptocurrencies, and stable coins, and new applications for distributed ledger technology, has come from the entrance of new kinds of players but they're new familiar players, particularly big tech, and big finance with this announcement, both by JP Morgan and Facebook, that they are entering into this space. And there's a--a lot of talk and a lot of buzz about this really reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Maybe, could you sort of help walk us through what exactly are the kinds of things that they're looking to do and--and why is it that they're interested in--in blockchain technologies more generally? </p><p>SWANSON: A quick question, who's--who works for JP Morgan, anyone here or Facebook. All right. </p><p>So yeah, the two that I guess I'll mention, and thanks for that, are JPM Coin. I know it's been mis-characterized by some calling it Diamond Coin, and some people aren't excited about it. That's fine. You don't have to be excited about it. I'm not here to shill--shill the coin or anything like that. But what--what's--what's--the reason why JPM Coin was created is--is a means to an end. They needed a way internally, or on this--this network that they created called IIN, they needed a way to--to effectively settle these different instruments that they may have created on behalf of whatever participants on the network, rather than having to rely on the outside, effectively the settlement rails that takes three to five days. So if you have unchained cash then you can provide effectively instant settlement and therefore, get rid of the--this locked up capital. </p><p>For example, if you look at the nostro vostro accounts globally, as an aggregate in the world, it's like $9-$10 trillion of capital is sitting there at any given time. So, you know, obviously, JPM Coin's not going to revolutionize that entire-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --So let me just--just--just jump in, just to make--make sure. </p><p>SWANSON: Sure. </p><p>BRUMMER: So what you're basically saying is, JP Morgan has customers. They need to service those customers. And by creating a new kind of rail they're able to allow some of their existing customers to settle their transactions faster. Or is it--is it faster? Is it supposed to be more--more--better security? You know, what--what is it that creating JPM Coin does that an Excel sheet wouldn't be able to do? </p><p>SWANSON: Sure. So that's a great question. As it of this--as it of this moment, in June, it looks like the you know, you could have an Excel--Excel chain, if you will, that would be just as effective because you're effectively relying on that one participant. In theory, though, the--the goal for them long-term is to enable other participants to potentially validate transactions on the network or even open to the network to--to other--other networks. In fact, the long-term goal for them, my understanding, is for them to--to actually allow retail participants and not just wholesale interaction. </p><p>So again, it's a means to an end. It's kind of, I hate calling it boring inter-bank related activity, but it is. It's--it's not something that you and I as--as its consumers would probably ever touch in the next couple years. Whereas, the Facebook phenomenon, which you were kind of mentioning, I believe, since they've taken all their data, now he wants to take all of money. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So for what it's worth, Facebook Coin, they--they're supposed to do some announcement, I think, on the 18th or so when they review all the information and until then, we can only speculate based on what we've heard. But what we've heard so far is it's going to be some--like a basket of--of currencies, kind of like an SDR, which is a basket of--of four or five different major currencies. So it's kind of a stable coin. We've heard that maybe the network participants are going to be charged up to $10 million to run nodes. So the--the model is very different than JPM--JPM Coin, which is kind of a means to an end for the--its customers and counter-parties, whereas Facebook Coin sounds like it's, or sorry, Global Coin I think is what they call it, is going to be, supposedly, for--for remittance market, for participants who are--for--for the billion plus users that they have to move money across borders. </p><p>BRUMMER: So ultimately, we're talking about two very different financial products, if we are to believe current reports. That on the one hand, you have Facebook, which is apparently going to leverage some of its messaging for its retail-ish people, normal people. And then you have Facebook Coin, which is looking to, at least immediately, service institutional investors and to service those institutional investors by establishing a--a new rail, a new means of transacting cross border. But I guess both of them have a cross border feel to it, right? I mean, because JP Morgan, I'm guessing, has lots of different banks and then you have Facebook, which has--is going to lever this messaging system for all of its billions of users. </p><p>And I will get to, for that question, Brad. Maybe if you could maybe elaborate some of what you've heard or--or thought about in terms of these new financial products or stable coins-- </p><p>CARR: --Sure-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --and--and also, any kinds of immediately or immediate regulatory questions (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>CARR: So I think, firstly, you know, if I can distinguish another model as well, and that's that of--of MUFG Coin, which I think is probably the most advanced of the--the prototypes we've seen around the world, whereas the JPM Coin is targeted in the--the wholesale sector. It's about, you know, it's the settlement of transactions for--for corporate counter-parties, whereas MUFG Coin is a lot more retail oriented. Yet MUFG's own marketing is that if you go to Tokyo for the Olympics next year you'll be paying for your meals around town with--with MUFG Coin. </p><p>You know, that notion is more one of its trying to modernize a retail payment or point of sale transaction. It's essentially enabling you to have tokens of some sort on your phone and paying with those as an alternative to cash. And the Bank of Canada prototype for a--a central bank digital currency, is essentially working towards the same sort of model. So you've got a few different variances there. </p><p>The--the scenario that--that I came up against on the JP Morgan one is, that I think is going to get really interesting is, so what happens when you end up with one bank holding another banks coin? You know, if--if, let's say Citibank is holding a JPM Coin, is that equivalent to holding JPM senior debt in terms of the credit risk profile? Or is it considered to be cash back because it's reserved? Are you convinced of the--the stable coin fixing? Or do you start to say, \"Well, actually, this is a different kind of risk profile?\" And then similarly, if a customer is given JPM dollars and getting JPM coins back, you know, from a--a ledgers perspective of--of how you assess that counter-party risk, are you knitting the--the dollars and the coins? </p><p>So you've got a few things there that--that I think are all manageable issues, but are ones that, in terms of the prudential framework, you'd need to work through which of those and establish whether or not this is essentially considered equivalent to, you know, coins and bank notes under the existing prudential framework. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's--that's--that's interesting. One of the things that I--I noticed when you travel, obviously, to different international regulatory fores (SP), how people look at it, particularly a stable coin, but also any kind of cryptocurrency depends on where they're coming from. So for those who may not be as familiar with the stable coin, they're called stable coins because they're--they're presumably pegged or reference to a--a certain basket, or perhaps even the U.S. dollar and they're not intended to fluctuate. And the way in which you can create that stability is--is varied at least. </p><p>CARR: Yep. Right. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and some of those ways can be just a straight peg or they could be algorithmic activities. </p><p>CARR: So--so if--so if you're a regulator trying to work out a prudential treatment that you're going to apply to this, one of the questions you'd need to establish is, you know, are you convinced of the--the peg? Or is this something that, you know, okay, it's fixed today but it may--may well not be in the future? </p><p>And to segue a little from the commercial bank tokens, you know, one piece we've--we've heard and we've corroborated in a few different places, is that the People's Bank of China has been developing a digital currency that would not be fixed against the renminbi. Now, there's a whole host of questions then that come to--to buy with that. You know, is that intended to segregate inward and outward capital flows away from the other currency? Is it something that's intended as a means of a--being a trade--international trade currency, or trade finance currency? Will Chinese industrialist in 10 years time insist that they're only going to pay you in--in digital renminbi instead of in dollars? </p><p>You know, there's a whole stack of questions that come about there for something that presumably would be, you know, somewhat stable, not entirely volatile. Presumably, the PBOC would have an interest in ensuring that that currency is--is not wildly fluctuating day to day and it retains some of its value, but it would not be fixed against the renminbi in that example. </p><p>BRUMMER: And-- </p><p>CARR: --Yep. So if I can make one more point. And well, you referred to Facebook, and you referred to the different treatments and definitions around the world. You know, the scenario I find really fascinating is, you know, are yourselves going to have individuals giving Facebook dollars in order to buy Facebook coins, or whatever it's called? When we get around and--and have the conversations with central bankers and regulators around the world, and we talk about, you know, \"Would you view the entrance of a big tech firm into finance?\" </p><p>You know, at what point do you start regulating them in the same way that you regulate a bank or an insurer or what? And quite a lot of central bankers will say, or supervisors will say that the tripwire is when they start taking deposits. And--and for that reason, a lot of them have--have steered clear of anything that could look like a deposit taking activity. But if individuals are putting their money into Facebook and being given Facebook coins, as a result, that starts to look a bit like a deposit. </p><p>KIM: Although it could too, I mean, what we've seen historically, not--is that, you know, it could just be money transmitters, too if they're not actually taking a deposit but offering a--a receiving to transmit on to another location. Now you see companies like Microsoft and others that have already received their licenses to be money transferred, a financial institution, but just a--a different than deposit taking financial institution. So there could be--it'll be interesting to see how that plays out in this scenario. </p><p>CARR: It's got a lot, perhaps, about the--the timing of the transactions and--and you know, whether or not consumers are being encouraged to, you know, deposit for some put--deposit, invest a--a chunk of money for some period for these tokens that they can then redeem in due course, and whether they're incentivize by coupons or discounts or somewhere else that--that starts to look a little bit like interest, or whether it's that you're just buying the tokens each time that you need them for the--the transaction, which would look more of a--a money transfer (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>KIM: Well, yeah, it will be interesting to see how it plays out because it could also be prepaid access. If you, you know, put $100 in and then you can use that-- </p><p>CARR: --Yeah-- </p><p>KIM: --use on the platform. </p><p>CARR: Yeah. </p><p>KIM: It will be interesting (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CARR: Maybe we'll find out on June 18 or--or maybe it'll be quite a long time after that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, I know that Amy has actually taken a keen interest in the upcoming G20 conversations, not just, you know, the--the very question of--of money transmission has to do in part, and it depends on which state you're talking about. Money transmitter laws are--are largely state-based in the United States and they have to deal with some safety and soundness issues with individual money transmitters, and you have to sort of get a license and the like. When you get to the federal level, where you're not necessarily asking about money transmission, per se, but you're concerned about market integrity, money laundering, and the other issues that are sort of embedded in the flow of money, those kinds of issues start to take on an international dimension as well. And--and Amy, I know you've been very, very involved in thinking through some of the money laundering issues, and some of the approaches taken by international regulatory authorities. </p><p>We'll be having a conversation, obviously, about the European approach and--and differences between EU and--and U.S. regulators a bit later. But there does seem to be more coordination, or at least it's--it's higher on the--on the to-do-list is--is the--is the money laundering AML question. </p><p>Where--where is--what is the state of things? What do you predict in terms of new rules and new approaches coming out from the G20? </p><p>KIM: Yeah. Well, I mean, just to start to kind of for context, I mean, certainly, you know, Bitcoin being the first iteration of blockchain that we've seen. It was a peer-to-peer payment system that's triggered financial services concerns, so that's--and--and financial services regulatory concerns, whether it's a JP Morgan coin or securities laws or, you know, anti-money laundering. That's why we've seen a lot of headwinds, I think, in the financial services space and how do they apply? </p><p>The U.S. was a--a front runner, I think, in--in addressing that in 2013, with Treasury issuing their guidance, which determined that the exchangers and administrators in this space were money transmitters, and therefore, money's a type of financial institution, the money services business in the U.S. So then that's the U.S. Federal perspective and then what you're referencing is the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force is an inner governmental body, that puts out recommendations with respect to anti-money laundering that about 200 countries then, you know, trickle down and implement in their host country. </p><p>So what they're looking at now is, you know, in October, they created a concept called Virtual Assets, which is, I think, maybe the first time I've ever seen it called Virtual Assets by a government or governmental type body, and then applied the--certain of the AML recommendations that they make to what they're calling virtual assets service providers. So that raises a couple of questions. I mean, first of all, I'm sure we all know, virtual assets can actually be a pretty broad category. These aren't all financial instruments and-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --They're not all cryptocurrencies, necessarily. </p><p>KIM: Right. I mean, typically, like we've seen in the U.S., you've dealt with it as a--a--a substitute for funds or currency, you know, more like a substitute for money. Their definition goes a little bit beyond that, and it says, you know, use for payment or investment. And, you know, as we're seeing in the securities dynamic, what's--an investment can be blurred, or you could--some people can view it as an investment and some people could be using it as on a platform, which I think is a whole other thing we can all debate about, maybe at a another time. </p><p>But and so, so that kind of argument is going on, where does that fit? And there's one in particular that's going on right now, that's a bit of a hot topic for some, which is how to apply this with respect to a very specific wire transfer rule, which applies for transfers between financial institutions of $3,000 or more? In that case, you would have to obtain certain information about both the person originating the payment and the person receiving it. And so if you think about that in a blockchain context, what do you know about the person originating that and then what do you know about the person receiving it? And so that's where some of the consternation comes in and where regulators are looking for solutions. </p><p>BRUMMER: And there's been an interesting amount of back and forth and--and some contestation between industry and regulators on AML issues. I mean, the idea, obviously, is if you increasingly, not just pseudonymous, but increasingly anonymous-like transactions then that could-some be a gateway for everything from narco-trafficking, to terrorism finance, and--and other kinds of issues. And I've--I've heard as--as others probably have as--as well, that part of that Financial Action Task Force approach, which was originally sort of half of a paragraph has now sort of ballooned into sort of a multi-page analysis of--of trying to interpret an initial approach towards AML rules for--for virtual currencies. What--what exactly, to your understanding, is that point of friction between industry and the regulators on--on AML issues? </p><p>KIM: Yeah. I mean, I think one of the issues is how do you know where that money is going? You know, I think from a regulatory perspective, the--the very specific issue is about money or wire transfers, but I think the bigger issue, and those of you working traditional financial institutions, you need to know who your counter-parties are to a transaction. And so that's what traditional regulators are used to seeing. And then, so if you're looking at this and being told, \"Well, I don't know who's receiving the money,\" you know, that's where you kind of get that. And so those are some--that's where the rub is occurring. And--and yeah. </p><p>CARR: And the industry is gun shy about that, given the magnitude of fines that have occurred in the last few years that have been specifically related to--to not having sufficient KYC, not knowing your client, not knowing where the money's going. </p><p>But also that, you know, I think the irony here is, (INAUDIBLE) the G20 have started out from this perspective I've been concerned about. I've--I've concerned about cryptocurrencies being used for AML purposes. The irony is, they're going to come around, I think, to a view that the blockchain technology is actually central to a big part of the AML fix. And I think a lot of where we're headed in the next five years is going to be around developments in digital identity, where I think blockchain has a big role. </p><p>Just to give you a couple of figures. So the UK banks spend more on AML then the UK government spends on prisons. You know, there's enormous amount of money being put by--by every bank in the world into AML systems at the moment. And the catch rate is terrible. According to Interpol, we capture between 1 and 2 percent of the illicit activity. So it's--it's a terrible return on investment for the level of--of time and money that goes in to--to AML processes at the moment. So we have to get better and smarter at it and one part of it is digital identity solutions. And I think there's other commercial imperatives for--for digital identity besides AML. So I think that this is going to have some real momentum behind it. </p><p>But again, you know, you also look at things like the feeds on a white paper that found that turning on machine learning algorithms drove a--a 75 percent catch right on fraud. The difference being that in fraud, you've got a really good reference data set to work with and in AML it's scattered all over the place. And the banks have got restrictions that mean they can't even share information within their own firm across borders on AML threats. They can't share themselves on a firm-to-firm basis. They don't get a feedback loop from law enforcement so when they fill in these thousands of suspicious transaction reports that never find out which one of those went anywhere. So you don't have the depth of the reference data to train an algorithm to get better at AML. So I--I think you're going to see that--that for, you know, given that that magnitude of that problem and the desire to get better, digital identity with blockchain having a role within it is--is a big part of what we'll see in the next five years. </p><p>KIM: I would agree with you. I feel like, sorry, that this builds into a bigger question. You know, we're--this the G20 and the FATF recommendations really focused on this one little thing on wire transfers. But that's only a very specific type of transfer between financial institutions that is triggered at a threshold level. There's all these other things that companies are doing with respect to on-boarding customers, monitoring transactions, filing transactions reports, with law enforcement responding to subpoenas, holding accounts open so law enforcement can-- You know, I mean, there's a lot that goes on in an AML compliance program. And there's--there's many people that agree. I--I'm one of them that agree that I think we need to modernize how we look at AML-- </p><p>CARR: --Yep, definitely-- </p><p>KIM: --compliance and enforcement. And you know, things like your name, date of birth, address, and social security number in the U.S., I mean, I don't know, does anybody here think that that's private anymore? </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, that actually is a very good question, because we are going to our Q&amp;A for just one or two questions. We're on a very tight diplomatic schedule, not withstanding our drinks at the outset. And if there were any individuals with one or two questions, do feel free to--to ask our panelists. I do find it fascinating that, and we'll have a chance later to talk a little bit more, the one question that--that no one's really brought up is the question that is something a security or not? And even where you have a stable coin, there are certain kinds of questions that arise depending on how you stabilize a cryptocurrency and--and--and what are the methodologies and technologies and tactics used to--to stabilize and to maintain a certain price of--of crypto-asset and that becomes very important. It could even become important for Facebook and other companies. </p><p>I see, sir. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Is that when you announced (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>BRUMMER: Exactly. And I have a solution. </p><p>QUESTION: Bert Delia (SP), banking consultant here in town. </p><p>Going back to JPM Coin, one of the objections of JPM Coin is other banks won't want to deal with it. And there's a parallel on this. Years ago, when Bank of America launched its credit card there were other--other banks that were reluctant to facilitate Bank of America Card transactions, which is why Bank of America Card eventually got spun off from B of A. So question number one is, how is JPM going to deal with that? And question number two is where does Swift fit into this picture, given the massive role that they currently play in cross-border currency movement? </p><p>SWANSON: I'll take the JPM one. So I--I don't think that their goal is to be used by everybody at this stage. They're more than happy, from my conversations, to--to work within the customer base and counter-parties and build on and see--see if there is anyone. But to your point, yeah, why--why don't other commercial banks do this? Ideally, I guess if we look at a spectrum, it would be great to have a central bank issue with digital currency. I mean, we could talk about that. Happy to discuss some of--some of the other just conversations on the sinkhole of money flour, which the BIS talked about. </p><p>To--to your point there, Brad, there's several different models on--on how central banks could do that. But yeah, a JPM point isn't trying to be everything for everybody and including for all their commercial banks. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah, Swift, Brad, is that something you want to-- </p><p>CARR: Look, probably. I'll probably just add to that, that, you know, I think any, you know, bank issued coin is going to have a need for interoperability. And you don't want to have things fragmenting into a scenario where you have a, you know, a--a--a seller telling its buyers, \"I don't want to be paid in JP Morgan Coin. I want to be paid in HSBC Coin or City Coin or whatever,\" then you're just fragmenting the whole system. So I think everyone's got an interest in ensuring that we get past that and we have an interoperable approach. </p><p>Swift, look, you know, I think there's--you know, and you constantly see the debate in the press with Swift and the discussions they've had with the Ripple, I think, during the Cyborgs Conference that Swift ran last year. There was a running commentary of all the--the crypto evangelists posting things furiously on every social media channel bashing Swift at the time. </p><p>My own perception is that--that the blockchain technology, where it's at right at the moment, struggles to handle the volume of transactions to be able to completely, you know, replace the existing Swift infrastructure. Where I think blockchain is really good is when you've got a smaller volume of complex transactions, trade finance, corporate lines, syndicated lines, bond insurance. So, you know, that's my sense of where the--the use cases or where it's the--the best fit. But I realize I'm wading into an area where some people hold very, very passionate views so I'm sure there's some contrarians. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, just to piggyback on this. And I'm--I'm just curious. So if you're talking about Facebook, right, and you already have WhatsApp, so you--you kind of have a messaging system, right. So--so the question is, how do you then, you know, if you think of the--the sort of life-cycle of the transaction, of the messaging, and then you have the settlement. And the question is, you know, how do you scale up to be able to handle lots of different--different transactions? And I guess you could say the same even if you had a large retailer, you know, like Amazon, creating a--a--they came out with a--a Bezos coin or something, you could--you could figure out some-- Or the--they--they already have an internal messaging protocol system. It's going to be the--it's going to be how do you actually use the--the--the blockchain technology. </p><p>Some folks have said yourselves can batch them together, and then others have come up with other kinds of interesting ways of running parallel systems in order to sort of accommodate lots of--of value. Have you, Amy or Tim, have you heard or talk to any--any individuals as to how do you scale up for these kinds of large transactions to make them commercially feasible, particularly when you do have big tech and big finance entering into the space? </p><p>SWANSON: Real quick. Who's ever used WeChat or WeChat Pay, anybody? Everyone puts their hands down. They don't want be doxed. All right. Well, I used to live in China. I worked at there for five years. I have WeChat so feel free to hack my phone, whoever you want to. I actually couldn't use WeChat Pay because I didn't have, out here in America, I don't have access to a Chinese bank. But yeah, they--they process, you know, gazillions of dollars a day, or--or a RMB's worth of money a day, and they don't need a blockchain. I'm not saying you need to have a blockchain but it's still unclear. That's why I'm saying once we find on the 18th, hopefully, they'll clear things up because right now, it doesn't make sense to me. </p><p>CARR: Probably the one of the things about is, you know, we shouldn't view the technology as static. And, you know, whilst I see some of those limitations in the technology today, you know, what's decided that in five years time that's still going to be the case. And you have things like quantum computing that are, you know, now coming out of the universities and going into commercial and R&amp;D. If that's hitting some sort of inflection point where that can be overlaid or built into other solutions. You know, we shouldn't assume that the--the technology--technology limitations that apply now will--will be forever. </p><p>KIM: Yeah. And we see new things every--every day. So, you know, with what we're seeing now in a year or two there may be a new solution for that. </p><p>BRUMMER: We have two questions up front and apparently one in back. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Well, yeah. Next we'll--we'll come up front. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. It seems like innovation has come in waves in different phases. Information Technology sort of led the way with a lot of innovation over the past--over the past few decades. In the last decade, finance caught up and I didn't think that they were going to move so quickly but they seem to be moving more quickly. Sort of wrapping up the rear, we have governance and--and legal frameworks and constructs. Where do you see opportunities to innovate in governance, and these constructs that we have inherited in order to advance some of the things that Information Technology and other industries are trying to advance today? </p><p>CARR: So I guess, there's broader view across the financial sector, where are the opportunities? Look, a lot of the--and so I'm--I'm from a--a center where we have 40 bank CEOs and chairs on our board from the biggest firms around the world. The view I often hear is that the single biggest innovation they're--they can make in the business at the moment is getting more things onto the cloud faster. And indeed, you know, then running into the issues that the whole industry is largely reliant on three cloud service providers. And also that regulators around the world in different markets have differing views as to their level of comfort and their requirements for cloud. </p><p>So you have some--some restrictions and fragmentation that can arise from that or that your--your business case becomes that you can implement cloud for 40 percent of your business, where you've got a regulator who's got on board with the technology. I think that's the--the--the number one and I highlight that in the sense, that most banks are the result of lots of mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. So they're coming from a starting point where not only do they have a 1970s or 80s mainframe base, but they actually have fragmented systems all over the place. And that cloud is--is therefore, a critical enabler to being able to get all of your data into a single data like where you--you can then run the sort of machine learning analytics and other that you really need to be able to, not only to manage your business from a risk management sense, but identify catch the bad guys in an ALM fraud sense, but also to be able to deliver the--the personalization and--and immediacy that customers increasingly are coming to expect because they--they've been exposed to that in other industries. </p><p>So to--to me, that's number one. You know, I think the--the other--I alluded to machine learning and the--the growth of that, both in commercial areas and--and risk management is significant. We'll have another report on that out shortly. But the other piece that we see, probably less in the U.S. but elsewhere, is the emphasis on open API's. That's been heralded by open banking, by PSD3, and the European Union. Open banking is proceeding now in--in Canada, Mexico, and Japan, and Hong Kong, and Australia, as well. And I think this is where we may see the emergence of, you know, platform-based banking in a--in a mix of guises. </p><p>You know, on one hand it will be the tech firms that come in and provide a platform and then market bank products on that platform. But it's also where you see some banks like Erste in Austria or an SEB in Sweden, that have really been at the forefront of saying, \"We want to be the platform. And we're going to provide the customer facing platform in which other banks products and FinTech firms products can be marketed on our platform because we see that as being the--the integral way of managing the customer relationship of the future.\" </p><p>And I guess as a final comment, I'd circle from that back to my earlier comment about digital identity. If you want to be the platform provider you're going to need to be able to do the digital identity that comes with that. And the digital identity that you provide is going to need to be interoperable with other digital identity frameworks as well. </p><p>SWANSON: Please. So, yeah, one other comment, and it's good to see you. It's been a long time, since last year. Actually, I actually when it's light. </p><p>So if you're looking for kind of an interesting example of weird governance that hasn't really worked out in--at least in the cryptocurrency world, there's this entity called Maker DAO. Has anyone ever heard of Maker DAO? And they has something called the DAI, which is supposed to be a stable coin. Anyways, they--as much as--and again, I'm going--I guess I'm going to--this is being recorded. So somebody's going call me a Federal Reserve show. And that's totally fine. </p><p>But with the Federal Reserve, we at least know who's participating in meetings, we know who's the governance body, we know when they produce reports and notes. With--with Maker, they have these calls in which we don't know--for--for all the talk about transparency, we don't only don't know who's necessarily taking part of the calls, but during the--the vote, who owns these votes, you have--or the--the voting process, you actually had some VC firms, so over a year ago, that bought a stake in these tokens. So as much as we--we had this discussion in the last couple years or number of years, about participation in--in governance, you actually have venture funds that are determining, for example, the interest rate on--on a token, and in this case, it went up to 19 percent. So ignoring their usury laws that--that may be an impacted here, the fact that we don't have transparency in some of these projects. And again, if you're from Maker, I'm sorry, I still have your shirts. It's nothing personal. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRUMMER: Great. A question here. </p><p>QUESTION: As we start to see institutional money come in, the endowments, the crypto funds, the trust, no FDIC type thing set up, do you think it's too soon? What's your kind of feel on that? Because you're starting to see the last couple quarters, a lot of 30 and 20 and 15 from groups, not just retirement systems and, you know, people of that nature are not individuals anymore. </p><p>BRUMMER: Okay, great. We're going to just skip this question. And then a very brief 20 second question. In this lighting, I did not even know that our guest of honor was here. I apologize. Did you want to ask very, very briefly your question? </p><p>QUESTION: I have a couple of quick questions about AML. And to the extent that there's the urban legend out there that everything is reported to the blockchain. How do you--how do you all deal with that issue? Because when you have exchanges which have Omnibus accounts, which do all these internal transactions, which never make it to the blockchain, how do you assure yourself that you haven't had a double spend issue? </p><p>Secondly, I'd note, because we have someone from Europe here, the recent action with respect to closing down a mixing or tumbling operation, which is used to basically obscure who owns what on blockchain reported transactions. So to the extent that there's this theory that you've got a perfect view of what's going on, because it's reported to the blockchain, I don't think that's true and I'd like to hear why that's not--my view isn't true. </p><p>BRUMMER: So I'm going to take, because I know that our guests is on a very tight schedule, I'm going to take, unfortunately, the moderator's prerogative to continue that discussion afterwards because we still have drinks left-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--and move directly to our keynote. I--I do apologize. I--I just did not know he was here. So I think we are going to applaud our guests. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We will answer these questions afterwards, and move to the second part. Yep, this way. Thank you. Thanks. </p><p>RESNIK: All right, thanks again for that great conversation. And thanks again to our panelists, Brad, Amy and Tim, for joining us. And as Chris said, it's time for our keynote interview with Mr. Steven Maijoor. Mr. Maijoor has been the chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, since taking up office in April of 2011. He's the first chair of the Authority and is currently serving his second five year term. He's responsible for representing the authority, as well as chairing ESMA's Board of Supervisors and the management board. The role of the board of supervisors is to give strategic guidance to ESMA and make all main regulatory and supervisory decisions. </p><p>Please join me in welcoming Mr. Maijoor. And Chris, the floor is yours. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRUMMER: Mr. Maijoor, thank you so much for coming here. As you can see, there's quite a bit of interest in what's happening in Europe and an appreciation for how many of those decisions can impact the--the American marketplace, both the securities marketplace, and the derivatives marketplace, and the FinTech marketplace. </p><p>As a professor, I--I tend to look at your job as--as very interesting and at times a bit difficult. European member states are having their own differences of opinion from time to time on the treatment of different kinds of financial products and--and--and how they should go about viewing cryptocurrencies in particular. What would you view as the pillars, if one will, of the understanding of how to go about thinking through the application of--of EU law to cryptocurrencies? I know you've gone through a consultative report and a process where you're trying to analyze and assess how your different members are--are viewing cryptocurrencies and regulating them. Where do you--where do things stand at this at this moment? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you very much, Chris, and--and very good to be here and thank you very much for the invitation to be at Georgetown University. </p><p>The--so as you probably are aware, so in Europe, obviously, we're--we're coming from a history with a--a large number of different financial markets. And basically, there's been work in the EU in--in the past, you know, going back to, basically, 40 years, trying to integrate these--these financial markets. And--and--and it goes back to the whole notion is that when you have scale, when you have bigger integrated capital markets, that ultimately, that would be beneficial. And so across all areas where ESMA is active, obviously, we're trying to be consistency and--and trying to improve cross border financial transactions, financial market transactions. That is--that is the key element we're trying to achieve. </p><p>Going on, specifically, on to maybe because that ties in probably most closest to the previous discussion, we are looking from a securities markets perspective to crypto-assets. So there's also, obviously, a lot of interest in the previous discussions, there was a lot of the payments issues, we're--we're more looking into that from a securities markets issue. And we're basically, we have taken the position and it was reflected in your comment on the advice, is that if it is a financial instrument, you know, if it looks like a financial instrument you should treat it like a financial instrument. And ultimately, that is a--a--a supervisory reduction. Although there are small differences across the member states what is precisely a financial instrument, which is quite surprising to some extent, if you look at it from a distance. You know, if you want integrate capital markets, at least you won't have the same definition of what a financial instrument is. </p><p>But by and large, we have reasonably common definitions around that, typically, there needs to be transfer ability, there needs to be a profit right. And so what we have done is in the exercise in India of crypto-assets, we have asked, basically, our--our national regulators, \"Here are six examples of crypto-assets. Would you qualify those as--as financial instruments, yes or no?\" And basically, depending on the type of crypto-asset it was, whether it was a utility type, whether it's payment type, or whether it's the investment type, there was commonality on the number of them being needing to be qualified and described as a financial instrument. </p><p>That brings you to the logic that if it's like a financial instrument you should regulate it like a financial instrument that has far reaching implications because once you are a financial instrument, you are put in the whole regulatory world so not only are you talking about possibly a prospectus, not only talking about clearing, we're talking about can it be used by asset managers? And so that is a big decision once it is a financial instrument. But we took the position, if it's a financial instrument, if it has the same characteristics--characteristics that should be regulated and supervised like a financial instrument. </p><p>So national supervisors are now moving into that direction. And so we know that now a number of them have been vetted under their national systems as a financial instrument and so they are brought within the regulatory remit. I think the big question is, and maybe being a bit critical on--on the development, to what extent will it survive once it needs to meet the regulatory requirements? Or to frame it in a different way, to what extent was it successful because it--it was outside of the regulatory remit? By bringing into the regulatory remit it cannot be, you know, because some of it might be, some of the benefits might have been related precisely to avoid regulation. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, certainly in the United States we have a very similar conversation going on. When you say financial instrument, we're thinking, is it a security or is it not a security? And obviously, if--if a financial instrument--instrument or--or a cryptocurrency is a security then you're brought into the wonderful world of our colleagues across the street over at the Securities and Exchange Commission. But one of the things that we don't have, which I think the European position is, is--is by definition much more interesting, is that because it's a federal question entirely, both in terms of an enforcement and also--well, although I guess the state regulators can also get involved, but largely the--the definitional question comes from the U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, you don't have the same degree, perhaps, of jostling and competition in terms of building up local financial markets, as perhaps, in--in the European Union, where there's a real interest by some of the member states to early into this space and--and in financial innovation, more--more--more generally in order to build up their financial centers. </p><p>How is it and what--what kind of guidance can ESMA play in helping to facilitate that, particularly in a world where you're also dealing with--with Brexit and--and the folks in the UK seeking to create their own financial centers? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Okay. These are many, many different issues in--in--in one question. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So--so first of all, generally, where for those of you who--who don't know ESMA that well, so we are a European body. And while day to day supervision is typically still at a national level, although for some areas, it is at our level. So for example, credit rating agencies and--and some benchmarks and--and also regarding CCPs will get direct supervisory powers. And so but the--the basic model in Europe is--is day to day supervision at a national level. But by entrance into one national market, you'll not only get entry to that financial market, you get entry to the whole of the 28 and that create, you know, creates all kinds of incentive issues. </p><p>To what extent that does that national regulator not only take into account the benefits for--for that member state, or the risk to that member state, but also takes into the wider implications for the whole of Europe. And so that is where, basically, ESMA comes in, is to make sure that those national supervisory and regulatory decisions are there to make sure that the whole European perspective is taken into account. To say it more bluntly, you can see that there might be some incentives to build a financial center without, you know--if most of the customers and clients are somewhere else in Europe, not having sufficient focus on the risk that you might be creating, instead, focus on the, you know, the benefits that a strong financial center might bring in terms of developing more economic activity, et cetera. </p><p>And so there is an important role for us to ensure consistency across--across the EU. Maybe first go back to the crypto-asset issue. And then because I think you're also mentioned Brexit if I listened carefully. So first on crypto-assets. So once it is determined to be a financial instrument we will--we will try and we have some--we have some instruments to make sure that the national regulators are as consistent as possible, where we have seen some of the national financial centers trying to, you know, to--to give a kind of a crypto-asset flavor to their financial center and trying to get that label. </p><p>The reality is that that is only possible for those assets, crypto-assets, which are outside of--which are not a financial instrument. And so there's more freedom there because that is basically then for the national regulators to decide. But there we have advice to the European Commission, to say and to the--to the EU political institutions, to say we need to have at least some risk warnings around those in AML. There's been a lot already a discussions on email, because that is an area where--where we see specific risk for crypto-assets. </p><p>Going to the Brexit issue, where and I think there are so many things to be said about Brexit, but I--I think you focused on the issue around regulatory competition, and how do we ensure consistency. One area where you can--so to prepare for Brexit, what is happening is that financial market participants are relocating from the UK to the EU 27, because they know that in the case of a no deal Brexit, or in the longer term, when the--when there's an orderly Brexit, is that there are problems in terms of the recognition of UK market participants. You know, having a license now in the UK is, of course, completely recognized across the EU. That will end for, you know, certainly in the case of a no deal Brexit. And so market participants are relocating from London to multiple financial centers. </p><p>Interestingly, it's not--there is not one big winner. It's going to different centers. You can see Dublin getting extra activity. Luxembourg, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, there's--there's some specialization, some focusing on asset management, someone on--on trading venues. Where our interest is to make sure is that there is no regulatory competition in the sense that these relocations, you can see the incentive to say, \"Come over here to my financial center. You will get the license for your entry to Europe but you can do it with a very little entity, with very little substance.\" And obviously, that is where ESMA comes in. And we say, \"We need to make sure that we have common standards for receiving this business.\" </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, this is a natural shift to a set of questions with clearinghouses. But I--before I get there, I did want to ask one question, which I find fascinating and maybe you could--you could help clarify. In the United States there are some conversations, particularly on the Hill, about cryptocurrencies that are not necessarily regulated or deemed to be securities from a U.S. securities law perspective, but still are sort of in this in between zone and there's a sense that they should somehow be subject to some kind of enhanced disclosures or--or--or something of the like. But given just the way in which our regulatory process works, that kind of directive won't and couldn't come from the SEC, because it's not within their mandate and it's not within their authority, and it's not coming from the CFTC either. And--and CFTC Chairman Giancarlo has gone to the Hill to sort of ask for a bit more of that authority. </p><p>To the extent to which, however, that lays within your authority to--to look at some of those crypto-assets, I assume that that approach, whenever completed in concert between ESMA and the commission and--and perhaps Parliament, that that would be for any such security within the block and therefore, it would be something that the rest of the world would have to think about in terms of the approach taken--taken by Europe. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Yes. So if I'm--I'm not sure whether I fully understand. So first of all, if we make EU law, obviously, you know, that is applicable all across the EU. </p><p>BRUMMER: I'm trying to softly ask about extraterritoriality. </p><p>MAIJOOR: No, so okay, okay. So first of all, in the EU, is, you know, all EU law is--once it is a regulation or directive, it applies across the EU. And when it's a directive there is some discussion how its implemented, but it needs to be implemented. When it's a regulation it is--it is directly applicable. </p><p>I think, on the issue around what should we do for securities that are not--or sorry, (INAUDIBLE) that--that look or smell or ceased received by investors or retail investors, like--and--and like a financial instrument, like a investment, but in reality are, according to the legal definition not. I think that is a very difficult area, because on the one hand, we want to be careful to say, \"Let's not legitimize it like a financial instrument.\" And so if you bring it into a kind of a bespoke regulatory regime you want to be careful not to treat it like a, you know, full supervising regulatory framework. On the other hand, there's precisely the issue around there should be sufficient risk, you know, risk indicators and to warn retail consumers around when they would buy this, although, in reality would not be a--a security. </p><p>On the issue of, interestingly, the extraterritoriality. The--of course, extraterritoriality has a bad name. But in reality, the flip side of this is--is a level playing field between--it is the--the flip side of having global markets and a level playing field. And so to--to, you know, to explain that better, if you--if you have an open EU capital market where you allow foreign marketplace to participate, which I think is completely right, you know, you want to have markets where there's broad participation, but you want to have a level playing field between the EU market players and the ones coming from outside the EU, also, you know, participating in that capital market providing services, that is a level playing field. </p><p>Then what is the implication is that you would say, \"Okay, you can provide your services in the EU. You can--you know, we can talk about clearing. We can talk about, you know, trading venues. We can talk about asset management in different areas.\" But you would basically say, \"If you provide services in the EU.\" That's fine coming from outside, but you need to live by the same rules for the EU clients.\" Obviously, it would not be around giving obligations for non-EU clients. But that, of course, is, you know, in the popular terms, seen as extraterritoriality because it goes back to the questions then outside the EU, if we want to provide those clients it means, you know, we have seen it with unbundling. </p><p>Unbundling was the--is the separation of execution and research in the case of research provided by brokers to--to their asset managers. We have asked for unbundling. The only thing we ask is that if there would be, for example, brokers from outside the EU providing services to EU asset managers just to say, \"It cannot be the case that as a non-EU provider and broker you don't have to unbundle while the EU broker has to unbundle.\" You would say, \"You need to do it. You need to live by those rules.\" But obviously, that has raised the debate here in the U.S., which is still ongoing, on, you know, to what extent should that be a common model? </p><p>And I think it's part of being a global market. You know, but it is an implication of having global markets and wanting to have a level playing field. And of course, the more different the rules are on a national or regional basis, the bigger this issue is. And therefore, it's so important to try to get at least international global standards, because the more you have them the less there will be these kinds of frictions. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, one of the most global industries is the clearing industry and--and under your remit and already lies this question of--of clearinghouses, which service customers from around the world and trillions of dollars run through the world's clearinghouses. As you may know, CFDC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has, or at least plans to, to provide for a CFDC vote relatively soon, a mutual recognition package for non-United States clearinghouses but allowing, in effect, non-U.S. clearinghouses to--to operate in the United States to the extent to which they are deemed to be roughly equivalent or--or comparable to or subject to regulatory regimes that are roughly comparable to that of the United States. </p><p>But there is a condition attached and--and that condition is that in order to enjoy this kind of recognition it would have to be, in effect, mutual and that the non-U.S. clearinghouse would have to be operating in a country that provides that kind of recognition to the United States. There are a lot of--there's a lot in that question, too. What is your sense, where does the equivalence process stand now? And--and even before, if--if you wish, you know, maybe it's useful just to walk people through what are you thinking through and--and what are your priorities at this point in time when you are--are--are trying to operationalize equivalents in the United (INAUDIBLE) of--in Europe, as--as pertaining to a non-EU counterpart--CCPs? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Yes. So this is much talked about also, you know, today and yesterday it was that today at the--at CFDC, at the Emmerich and--and also had some other meetings at the--at the CFDC. So I think it's important to have a bit of a history here. </p><p>So Europe has had equivalence mechanisms already for a number of years. And while it is a--and the--the implication of the equivalence is that once equivalence is provided is that the EU fully relies on the foreign regulator and the foreign regulatory system. And so when equivalence is declared, basically the EU says from those jurisdictions, for this part of the market, so it's never equivalent across the board for all financial markets, it's, you know, it is it goes from credit rating agencies to--to--to clearing, for trading venues, and--and they are slightly different then so you need to look at a piece, you know, law by law what precisely equivalence means. But generally, it means is that these foreign market participants can basically fully participate in the EU markets while the EU fully relies on the local, you know, the home country rules and home country supervision. </p><p>Generally, that is a good system, but you should also realize is that, ultimately, it might--it gets to the point is that as Europe you have no tools at all, nothing, in--in such a situation to even say, \"I want to have more information on debt market participants. Because they are very active in the EU there might be certain risks and I want to understand what those risks are. And if I have seen those risks I want to--I want to address those risks or maybe have a supervisory tool to respond to those risks.\" </p><p>And so the equivalence system, as we have had until very recently, is a system where the ultimate consequence is full reliance, we're doing it, we're doing it in various areas. But you can understand and we have made a point already, before Brexit, that this is, in some cases, not the right model. In some cases you want to be sure that you can assess the specific risks that might be coming from outside the EU from financial market participants from outside the EU, for the EU because we're not sure whether that has the same priority in the, let's say, in the ranking for that regulator in--in the--in the other country. </p><p>And so we start, you know, we have started to change our thinking on that. And obviously, our thinking has accelerated because of Brexit. We know that the UK will continue to be, for the foreseeable--foreseeable years, the most important financial market for the EU. Is it appropriate for a financial--for a region to--you need to rely on a financial center. Your main financial center is outside of your region. But in addition to that, if you would take the consequence of the current equivalent system, you are fully--you need to fully rely on--on the local regulators. They're very professional. We work very well with them but also it's from an incentive standpoint, the right mechanism to have. </p><p>That is the reason that we said we need to change our equivalent systems. And so you can see that in various parts of EU law where this is changing. So it's not only changing for CCPs, but for example, it is also changing for investment firms. There are a large number of the investment firms from outside the EU providing their services in the EU. And again, equivalence would mean here full--full reliance on the third country regulator. And so that is the reason we have said we need to change the system, but again, only when in the case of CCP, it is--it can be relevant from a systemic perspective. </p><p>So only CCPs that might be relevant from a systemic perspective would be in the category where you would have additional supervisory tools. For those that are not in the category, that are not relevant from a systemic perspective, they would continue to have the possibility of full equivalents, full reliance. And also, even within the category where we would have certain supervisory tools and where the EU regulatory requirements would apply directly, there is the possibility of comparable compliance and so you would rely there, but on a--you need to make that assessments on a requirement by requirement basis what do you can rely there on the home country regulation of that CCP. </p><p>BRUMMER: Is--is there a sense in terms of the timing by which or--or--or the order at which you're proceeding in terms of granting equivalents to those non-EU based CCPs? Is there a sense as to when that process will be fully completed in light of the timing created if, for no other reason, externally by--by Brexit or a potential departure from it? </p><p>MAIJOOR: So--so the--so first of all, all these equivalence decisions have been--you know, we have already done a large number of equivalence decisions regarding--regarding countries outside the EU. For--for CCPs, we currently have 34 third country CCPs recognized with ESMA so they can fully participate in--in the EU market. The--the key next--the key step would be, of course, which--which will continue to be tier one CCPs, and which would be eligible or need to be in the tier two category, where you would have the--the supervisory powers and the direct application of EU law. </p><p>The process we are in, we have just published our consultation papers on key elements of this law, which is around (INAUDIBLE) and around the comparable compliance. So everybody can now react to those consultation papers. We plan to give our advice to the commission by the end of this year. And then the commission has a maximum of one year to implement those delegated acts or to decide on their--their delegated acts. And then after these delegated acts are there, the actual decision on tier one and tier two, we'll start off to that. And so it depends a bit whether the commission--so to have a--so we expect that the--the form of law will be in the official journal by the end of this year. That will,--from that moment on the clock will start ticking for the delegated act, the relevant laws that are especially relevant for third country CPCs. The commission need to decide on these within a year, but they could get quicker if they, you know, if they can decide quicker. And then only after that we can start our process regarding tier one and tier two. </p><p>BRUMMER: I know that they are going to be one or two questions for the audience. I did want to end with one question as we--as we find folks, and feel free to raise your hand, is with the Capital Markets Union. Obviously, we started off with cryptocurrencies, then we talked about clearinghouses, which are really the ultimate FinTech in many ways. Is the--are there any agenda items right now relating to FinTech, to your knowledge, that are on the table when it comes to the development of the Capital Markets Union? </p><p>MAIJOOR: I think the--so first of all, we need--Europe is a financial system with a too large banking sector, we paid a high price for that also in the financial crisis. I think you can make a point that having a better balance between the banking system and the non-banking system is that you can make the financial system more stable. And you will understand that in these discussions, the U.S. is frequently mentioned as, you know, the example where you have much more successful--well, capital markets are much deeper and--and they play a bigger role in the--in the economy and the financial system. We should--we should do the--you know, we--we should push for that, where Europe has been working on it for--for many decades already. And so I'm sure that the next European Commission will, again, work on that. </p><p>I think where technology comes in is where--one area where we think there needs to be much more improvements, is around cheaper distribution of products to retail consumers, you know, more standardization, more robo advice, more transparency on costs. We would hope that technology helps there to make sure that we get a better deal for--for the end consumer. </p><p>Currently, as a consumer, we can see that in our day to day lives is that there's been the biggest progress, at least how I see it, is--is in the payments area, our banking apps, how we can do the payments so much easier in our family, how we can now get better deals in terms of when we are in--in the U.S. and having a better rate for exchanging the U.S. dollar against the euro. And so in the payments area, we--I--you can see, and I'm personally I experienced as a client, how much progress there has been there. I can really see that there's been so much benefit to the consumer. I think that is not as far yet in securities markets. But there I would hope that in terms of standardization of advice, making it more inclusive advice, which is available for also people with a smaller purse, and more transparency of financial products, that they're--especially technology can help. </p><p>Other areas, there is where, of course, we're working on is--is things like cloud issues. Supervisory issues are very important for us. Cybersecurity risks are important for us. We're working on that. </p><p>BRUMMER: And that would be at the Capital Markets Union level? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, on the--I think on the capital markets unions, especially I--I think the distribution, cheaper distribution, more transparent distribution, I would--you know, we have seen in so many parts of our lives how services have improved because of technology. Securities markets have been lagging a--a bit there. And--and I think it--it will be--that is the area where I see the opportunity. </p><p>BRUMMER: Fascinating. </p><p>Are there any questions from our audience? This reminds me of my law school course. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Afraid of the regulator to--to raise your hand. </p><p>MAIJOOR: There's one. </p><p>BRUMMER: All right, excellent. </p><p>MAIJOOR: He--he saves it. </p><p>BRUMMER: He does save it. </p><p>MAIJOOR: He's there. </p><p>QUESTION. Hi. My name is President Sibbett. I'm a--a postdoctoral fellow at the Global Governance Center, at the Graduate Student Union in Switzerland. </p><p>I'm just wondering what thought ESMA has given in terms of developing regulations to assert European strategic autonomy in relations to U.S. sanctions, and particularly, as it relates to the--in the area of cryptocurrencies and what can be created there? Thank you. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Sorry, on which area? </p><p>QUESTION: Strategic autonomy from U.S. sanctions and U.S. regulations. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, I--I think probably I would not be--you know, this is--this is not the, let's say, the typical area of the--of a securities markets regulator. And so I'm--I'm getting into territory where I do it more, basically, as a--as a reader of newspapers than with the expertise knowledge. But we--we know, but just to convey that message, we know that there are discussions around-- You know, one of the implications of sanctions and effectiveness also is very much related to the role of the currency that it plays in global trade. And we--we very much know that the U.S. dollar has been much more successful in that respect than the euro. </p><p>I think, what is interesting there, I think the--so far the formal position has been, from most of the central bankers that I know, is that they are say, you know, whether--whether the euro would be a, let's say, a global currency that is used trade, if we are neutral visa vi that position, you can see, at least I've seen some signals, that you can see that that is changing by some of the central banking and some in the central bank community. </p><p>BRUMMER: And certainly, when it comes to the AML issues, one thing I noticed, just reading the--the earlier consultative reports, is that from ESMA and--and from the EBA, is that there does seem, and it's not the same thing as sanctions, but on the AML and a conversation that we had just in the preceding panel, that there does seem to be a lot of energy and--and--and work towards pushing through a very unified approach, and an upgraded approach towards any AML related issues, both in your Europe and--and globally. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Just to, because I--just to--one other part of the coin, I know that there's been and I--maybe that's the--the--the other part of your--your question, so we know that there's been sanctions in certain--certain countries, you know, outside of the--outside of the EU. If you're talking about sanctions by, let's say, regulators from the U.S. visa vi European finance or market participants, in principle, I think that is part of a system where you, without going into individual cases and whether they are right or wrong in individual cases, but I think the consequence of global capital markets, where you have supervision at a--at a national or regional level is, and if there would be a foreign market participant active in the EU and they will do--you know, they would not live by the EU rules, I think it is--it is right to be sanctions in--in that case. </p><p>And so maybe that is the other part of your question or the issue you're referring to. But in principle, I think that is a--a possibility that is related to the fact that you have global capital markets, that if you provide services cross border, there are--is there is indeed, the possibility that if--if those services are provided cross border, but they don't meet the--the--the relevant rules and regulations in that country, is that you can be sanctioned. </p><p>BRUMMER: Given the cross border, and I--this is a way to maybe, perhaps, tie up the earlier panel with--with this one, from ESMA's perspective, when you hear about companies like Facebook, or JP Morgan and other companies, big tech, entering into the space, do you have any--any thoughts, observations? Does--does this percolate to the--to--to your--to your to-do-list when you see these companies themselves thinking about creating alternative, or--or I shouldn't say alternative, but creating virtual currencies that, obviously, are going to be, in--in the case of Facebook, potentially used all over the world and--and--and within the European Union? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, obviously, as far as, you know, what--what I my understanding, so far, this is more in--in--and you call it also currency and so it would be more for the banking regulators to work on that. But obviously, on ICOs, on crypto-assets with an investment, a characteristic on these things we talk, you know, we talked globally, we talk to each other. We, in (INAUDIBLE) we inform each other about our experiences. This is an area where, as a regulator, you need to be humble, you need to be--you try to understand these new developments. And so there is a global regulatory community thinking about these issues. We know that the FSB is involved into analyzing crypto-assets and--and I think that--is that is only logical. Typically, these new developments, you need all the brainpower and--and the--the expertise to address those issues. And so, you know, obviously, talking about these issues on a--on a global basis among regulators is very important. </p><p>BRUMMER: And with the public. </p><p>Thank you so very much for your time. It's been immensely useful for the Washington community. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you very much. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you, sir. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you. Appreciate it. </p><p>RESNIK: All right. Thank you, Chris and Mr. Maijoor, for the fascinating discussion, and a special thank you to Georgetown University Law Center for hosting us this evening. </p><p>Two things to leave you with. First, a quick reminder to subscribe to Chris's FinTech Beat podcast, now available on iTunes and in fact, tonight's interview with Mr. Maijoor will be the next episode. And second, the bar is still open-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--so feel free to enjoy. That concludes our programming for tonight. Thank you so much for coming and we look forward to seeing you at our next event. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCF-WT61-F15W-H16T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

FinTech. My name is Mike Nolan and I am the vice president of content at CQ Roll Call. And I just want to say, I'm thankful for everyone here joining us this morning as well as those liveing--watching on our livestream. </p><p>Today's discussion will spotlight the blockchain infrastructures, regulatory responses to Facebook's Libra, Wall Street's perspective and the future of cryptocurrency regulation. As we all, know Mark Zuckerberg will be speaking in front of Congress this morning and we want to make sure to keep you ahead of the curve on what's going on. So we will be simulcasting the latest news updates from our hearings, from our journalists down on Capitol Hill and we will be directing questions to our panelists to get their reactions, fact checks and observations. </p><p>But before we kick off the discussion, I like just to set the stage for today's dialogue. As you know, we--today's world is a rapidly changing one and every industry is going through some transformation and turbulence, mainly driven by technology but also political and governmental changes as well. And at CQ Roll Call, for the last 75 years, our publications have been unbend the--unbiased nonpartisan legislative and regulatory analysis. </p><p>And now, in partnership with Chris Brummer, we've launched a--launch new coverage of FinTech's technological and regulatory impacts. Our latest podcast which I recommend subscribing is Fintech Beat which features exclusive interviews with U.S.  and global thought leaders to help listeners stay informed of cutting-edge issues and inno--innovation is transforming the business of money. </p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Good morning and welcome. As Mark mentioned, I'm Reena Aggarwaal, the director of the Georgetown Center for Financial Markets and Policy. We at Georgetown are delighted to be part of this event and we really are doing a lot of work. Chris Brummer and his team at the Law Center, at the business school, at other parts of Georgetown, we are doing a lot of work on FinTech, blockchain. And we have a number of partners like we are part of the Ripple university ini--initiative. And so we are delighted to have you here today. </p><p>And I have the pleasure of having an amazing group of panelists here. One of our panel members is stuck in Washington traffic and will join us very soon. It's a fascinating time to be in D.C. with everything that's going on here, but I'm talking about the Nats, right, and so we're--we're thrilled to have the Nats in the World Series. But le--let's talk about our panel here. We're going to look at the macro view and before we get started, I'm going to ask our panelists to introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about what they do and then, we'll go right into the questions. </p><p>CARTER: Okay, Thank you, Reena and thank you to Chris for inviting me back for another year. It's a great pleasure to be here. So my name is Nic Carter, I'm a partner at a venture firm called Castle Island Ventures based in Boston. We invest in start-ups building on top or adjacent to public blockchains exclusively and I'm also the founder of a start-up called Coin Metrics, which is a start-up that pulls economic data out of block chains to trying to understand them and to characterize the nature of the blockchain economy. </p><p>BENCH: Thank you, Reena. I'm Bob Bench. I am the director of Applied Fintech Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. As a Bostonian, I am terribly disappointed to see this many people in the room. After game one in 2004, when the Red Sox played, we would not be awake at this point. I think we would still be celebrating. I'm a neighbor of Nic in Cambridge as well. </p><p>The applied Fintech Research Division is part of a system effort to effectively better understand emerging technologies and--and how we can use those emerging technologies to better the goals of the system. And to that point, we provide subject matter assistance. One thing I'm learning at the Federal Reserve, I'm brand-new, is that to call yourself an expert at the Federal Reserve means you probably need 20 to 40 years in any specific subject matter. </p><p>I am far too green to ever consider myself an expert within that system. And then, we do real experimentation with real technology to understand what tools we can use to improve our methods of managing and overseeing firms in the economy as a whole. </p><p>DARROW: Good morning. My name is Ian Darrow, I work for a company called Protocol Labs which is a company to build open source software to upgrade the fundamental infrastructure of the Internet. One of our projects is a public cryptocurrency that is attempting to create a decentralized market for file storage. I'm based here in D.C., I wear two hats of Protocol Labs. One is senior policy counsel and one is software engineer. </p><p>So my theory is that to make staying policy around this stuff, you should understand how it works at a pretty detailed level. That's what I try to do, although, we'll see. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Okay. So but let's kick off into our macro topic for the panel here. And we have a number of central banks from China, Sweden, Bahamas and lots of other countries that have started to experiment with the whole idea of digital currencies. And--and then we have other central banks that are taking a much more cautious approach to this. So just a broad question. Do you think it's inevitable that central banks will have these digital currencies that will play a global role? Anyone. </p><p>CARTER: So I--I would say, I always find the phrase CBDC kind of funny because most currency is already digital. You know, we have cash obviously, but it's being--it's being increasingly marginalized. As--as--as governments try and enhance their surveillance over the economy and in--in places like Sweden, cash is--is almost obsolete. </p><p>So it seems like it's an inevitability that governments will try and exert more and more control over their citizens through the lens of--of money and--and you know, privacy in terms of transactions will be a thing of the past, whether it happens through a CBDC, I can't speak to that, I don't know. But it certainly seems to be the direction things are heading. </p><p>BENCH: Yeah, I think, I mean, as a central banker, I guess I need to answer this one. To your point, most value in the world is already a CBDC, right? So commercial banks have exclusive rights to the central bank and all, right. Retail persons don't have access to CBDC. I think that's a differentiation. People talk about CBDC., what they're really talking about is retail, CBDC. direct--direct to non-banks--non-commercial banks. </p><p>And inevitably, I think technology's inevitable but how it gets pushed out in a policy way is--is a very broad question. But I think part of our job in Boston is to be what we call curious but careful, right? We want to understand the developments and we will not--there's no head-in-the-sand going on with our division. By careful meeting, this is the most critical infrastructure in the United States from an economic standpoint, and so--and there's a lot of smart people that have built the, you know, the digitalization of value within the Federal Reserve System who have been doing it for 20 and 30 and 40 years. </p><p>So this isn't their first rodeo at digitalizing value, and so we're understanding what other countries are doing but we're careful because we understand how critical it is from my infrastructure standpoint. </p><p>DARROW: We're unanimous that currency is already digital. So the panel agrees which I think is good. I would strongly echo Bob's point that this is a question not of whether digital currencies will become prominent but of who will get to access and control them. It's totally critical infrastructure, there's a real value judgment there in terms of whether you think that access that infrastructure should be pushed all the way down the stack to individual users or whether it's important to have it controlled and monitored by a smaller and, you know, arguably or more trusted or not, group of people depending on which governments in which countries you're talking about and I think that's one of the fundamental questions in this space right now. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So if it's inevitable and it's going to happen, it's already happening and our panelists are unanimous about that. What are the concerns of some central banks are being a lot more cautious while others are being more aggressive about it, what are the concerns? What are the pitfalls to watch out for? </p><p>DARROW: Here's a concern that I've heard articulated on the Hill in meetings which is that the American financial system--I'm talking--I'm talking about the United States specifically, although obviously other countries working on this as well. The concern is that the American financial system is the envy of the world and it's because our markets are so orderly and so regulated. So we should be conservative in our approach, we should sort of let this innovation happen somewhere else then see how it goes and then take the best pieces and incorporate them into our system, and then capital will flow back into the American system once it implements this infrastructure. </p><p>I've heard this argument made, I think it's 180 degrees wrong. I think technology moves really quickly and when it takes hold someplace sometimes, that's permanent. So like for example, Silicon Valley is Silicon Valley because Fairchild Semiconductor was there for like a five year period and tons of smart people acquired a bunch of capital because it was really important and now, 50 years later that's still the center of tech in the developed world. So the same thing could happen in the financial system if cryptocurrency or digital currencies are really important innovation and they get built somewhere else. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So I get it that the U.S.  financial system it's huge it's really large it's complex and so the regulators want to be careful. But then at the same time, I wonder about this China, it's--it's pretty huge and certainly in terms of number of people it's complex but they seem to be more aggressive about it. </p><p>CARTER: It's because they have less of a concern for individual rights to be perfectly frank about it. So the fact that all commerce in China is surveyed through WeChat and Alipay, that's acceptable under their standard. But--and I don't think it would be acceptable to many individuals in the U.S.  who value things like transactional privacy. You know, we're increasingly seeing financial exclusion being used as a--as a cudgel to, you know, de-platform entities which are deemed problematic, you know, whether that's, you know, corporations that sell guns. </p><p>For instance, so it's, you know, the banks are being pressured to stop that flavor of commerce or social media platforms which don't adhere to the conventional standard in terms of suppressing speech or, you know, sex workers who--who get kicked off of Venmo or PayPal. So, you know, in the U.S. , we're seeing an erosion as well and, you know, probably approaching the Chinese standard but many people hold these values very dear and if we--we totally surrender our financial rails to, you know, either the government or corporations and we lose the--the anonymity characteristics of cash I think that has a really chilling effect potentially. </p><p>I know lots of people in this room would disagree with that but I--I think that's a value that--that many people hold dear and--and is coming under pressure as we--we--we start to surrender transactions to either corporate or governmental monopolies. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So is that why we get so concerned when the private sector or big tech, Facebook for example, gets into this business, the privacy issues, the data issues in addition to who lost, a lot of other issues, is that sort of why the concern is if the central bank is doing it it's different? </p><p>CARTER: Well I mean, soon Zuckerberg will testify today and I'm sure he'll be challenged on the fact that, you know Facebook, effectively is an algorithmic censor of speech and, you know, they do--they decide which narratives to promote, which to suppress and, you know, why wouldn't they pursue that with Libra as well? I mean, I would be--I think I'd be surprised if Zuckerberg isn't challenged on that front today. </p><p>But I suppose if--if a central bank is--is, you know, has achieved total control and total granular control over the money supply through a retail-facing CBDC, the expectation might be different because they're in theory accountable to their people. But Facebook is not in any way accountable and that's why many people have trepidation about letting Zuckerberg, you know, be the final arbiter over which--which transactions are permissible and which aren't. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Do you want to add anything? </p><p>BENCH: I think into your point, I think there's a lot of questions about, you know, I'll step back and say that one thing that this movement starting in with was Nakamoto's was the idea of value as data, right? that the data is--value is just another data point and prior to 2009, it primarily existed on closed loop networks, right, and still most of value consists in closed loop data networks. </p><p>One thing that this movement that both that the--the panelists here have worked in is that it's changed that conversation. That now value moves over open loop networks and that unless you really want to restrict those open loop networks like some countries choose to do, it makes it a lot more difficult and things like--and this technology also allows other data to be held, right? So transaction like BTC is just a transactional data, but other types of smart contracts can carry a lot more data, including PII. </p><p>And so how certain countries or certain private actors exercise what to put into that data set can be really concerning for policy makers and for citizens who may not feel comfortable with people managing that--who are managing that data set. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So I suppose we get a lot more concerned about a Libra than we do about the JP Morgan coin. Is that kind of what you were talking about earlier, that's a very wholesale market versus but Libra you start talking about the retail market and that makes a big difference. </p><p>DARROW: Yeah, it's not clear to me how JP Morgan's coin is different from the way that banks already shuffle money around between themselves. It's--its infrastructure, it's not anything that is I think gonna change the world. That's--that's my view, I could be convinced otherwise. They haven't talked about that much about it. </p><p>CARTER: So yeah, whereas Libra is directly targeting in their own words, you know, all of the billions of Facebook users, you know, normal individuals around the world, you know, they--they stress the remittance use case that, you know, partly, they're going to go for people that are unbanked. And, you know, while that may be very potent for them in terms of economic inclusion, there's also a risk there that, you know, I don't know exactly what the archaeology or the topology of the Libra chain will be. But, you know, if it's--if it were a system like Bitcoin which we know will see, their transactional data will be inscribed into a chain for essentially all eternity. </p><p>I mean, we don't know precisely how it's going to work yet, maybe we'll get some elucidation on that today. But, you know, we've already seen this occur in cryptocurrency where you know users can be deanonymized just by third parties scrutinizing the on chain data. You know, it's--it's not that difficult to--to build a sophisticated analysis of the chain and determining who, you know, who's using it. So I mean it's not 100 percent clear whether individual transactional level data will be written into the Libra blockchain and whether that'll be available for public scrutiny but there's certainly a risk there that--that, you know, it enables kind of a mass surveillance of retail transactional activity. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Kevin, welcome. </p><p>WERBACH: I'm so sorry to be running late getting here, yes. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So Washington traffic can be pretty crazy. We went around and introduced ourselves if you want to tell everyone a little bit about what you do. </p><p>WERBACH: No problem. I'm Kevin Werbach I'm a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, work on legal and regulatory aspects of emerging technologies, have been focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency, the last several years. I run a workshop called Reg@Tech at Wharton that brings together regulators from around the world with legal experts and industry representatives on these issues. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So Kevin, let me turn to you. We've just been discussing how different countries are approaching the--the whole talk on the digital currency area. What are you seeing globally? What are different countries doing? Who is more aggressive about it? Why? </p><p>WERBACH: They're all looking around at each other and trying to figure out the answer to that very question basically. I--I--I think it's something of a misnomer to talk about this as a horse race. I hear a lot about the United States is behind and Singapore is ahead or Switzerland is ahead, and it's not really that simple. You've got for example, a number of different regulators who have different issues. One of the distinguishing factors of the United States is we have a fragmented system. So you've got the SEC and the CFTC and the people at Treasury and the Fed and so forth. </p><p>In some of the countries, that's one regulator but they still have the same breadth of issues. I think there were some countries that got excited about the potential of the token economy when the ICO boom hit and really tried to carve out space for this notion of a utility token independent from tokens as a fundraising implement. But what we've seen is that, you know, that bubble has largely burst. You don't see multi-billion dollar ICOs happening now today even in the jurisdictions that have been much more willing than the United States to create a--a legally valid mechanism to do that outside of traditional securities regulation. </p><p>So I think really, what--what Libra highlighted was that there's a whole suite of issues here that everyone is going to have to deal with. If we're talking about something that's small scale and local, maybe not. But we're talking about transforming the financial system of the world and that's not something that's going to happen in one country. So I--I--I think you know you can look at specific cases and criticize specific decisions but I think really and when I talk to regulators, they're all still trying to figure this out. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Do you definitely see the demand side? What's creating the demand? What--what is it--what's the--eight--what are the issues that are going to get solved? </p><p>WERBACH: Well, it depends what you're talking about. So if we're saying what is the demand for a fundraising instrument that doesn't have some of the limitations of traditional securities regulation and that allows for example, ordinary people around the world; retail investors to have access to some of the capital raising mechanisms that traditionally they don't have access to. That's a very different question from saying how can we improve global payments. And that's also very different question from saying, well, how can we deal with the billions of people who are unbanked. </p><p>So you--you've got to really break it down. But I start at the beginning that the demand comes from the fact that we have a centralized ledger based system that basically blockchain is a new, what I call, a new Architecture of Trust, that's the title of book that I wrote. And basically, it solves four problems when there are multiple independent actors who don't trust each other by for the first time, creating a system where there can be a shared source of truth where they can all have one shared ledger that they are relying on as opposed to basically having their own copy of information, and then reconciling it. </p><p>That's--that's a fundamentally different approach and that approach solves for all the problems you get in the traditional fragmented system which is things like the--the cost and the delays and other problems in that kind of system. So I--I think that that certainly is going to cause demand but--but it has to be implemented in particular cases. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Let me turn to cryptocurrencies in general, all right. So but do they have a destabilizing effect on the global economy? </p><p>CARTER: I wouldn't go that far. I think many people in this room have--have written off cryptocurrency entirely as a--a passing fad something which was the, you know, momentarily exciting in 2017 and now has--has returned to irrelevant. I'd say the story is--is maybe a little bit different. You know, cryptocurrencies is a--is a fancy word just meaning money which is not issued by government, but is also not owned by any single entity which isn't administered by inanity. You know, of which bitcoin is the RG tip-- the archetype. </p><p>And so what we've seen now is Bitcoin's 11 years into its existence just about and there's this renewed enthusiasm for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including stable coins, you know, in countries--in particular in countries where there's been some sort of failure of the--the monetary system. So we've seen, you know, the Turkish lira has depreciated by about a third in the last 12 months. The Argentine peso by about half and--and obviously the Venezuelan bolivar has vanished to essentially nothing. </p><p>All these places have vibrant over-the-counter and peer-to-peer markets for cryptocurrency. So, you know, while it been, you know, cryptocurrency money outside of the purview of the state may not be relevant in the U.S.  where the financial system works very well. For the marginalized, kind of Global South, in countries where inflation is really high, where the government is really not to be trusted as monetary authority, they're proving to be more credible, you know, than the local sovereign government. </p><p>So I think there's always going to be a niche there and a usefulness. And, you know, I--I feel like a lot of the--the skepticism maybe is sometimes due to sort of an Anglocentrism whereby you know we believe, you know, that nobody else may ever need a--a system of property rights or money outside the context of the state. But I would challenge people to look at what's actually going on and seeing that these systems for the most part is still functional and operational. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: We had Terry Duffy, the head of the CME group at Georgetown recently and he was talking about Bitcoin futures. And saying that they introduced options because there's enough volume and liquidity. So they're going the next step and introducing options. So I suspect, you're right, that there is activity going on, there is demand in cryptocurrencies, at least some of them and these new instruments are showing up. But yeah-- </p><p>WERBACH: Yeah, if I could add something there, I think Nic is absolutely right if we're talking about the potential for destabilization of monetary policy that basically, the cryptocurrency substitutes for somehow destabilizes the central banking system in a country where it's more that countries that have problematic or weak monetary policy, this becomes an alternative. And that's--that's frankly one of the concerns that FacebookLibra generated that you would have something and I apologize if this was covered before I got here, akin to what's happened in some countries with dollarization where they're basically taken the dollar because it's stronger even though it's from the U.S. , they might take Libra stronger than their local currency. </p><p>The other scenario though about risk of destabilization and crypto currencies is really systemic risks and that--that gets to what you were suggesting. What we saw in 2008 during the financial crisis was there was far more risk embedded in the system than anyone realized because there were all these complex derivatives and the interaction effects led to there being not sufficient capital once the whole thing had to become unwound. It's possible as use and adoption of crypto currencies as digital assets increases as you--as you said as there are more of these derivatives available, as there's more different trading mechanisms built upon crypto currencies, that can create new kinds of systemic risks. And that all depends on how those instruments are implemented. For example, whether they allow a--essentially, a credit based system where someone can essentially borrow against the crypto asset that they have on record similarly to the way you can borrow on securities today. </p><p>I think we have to look to that possibility and it's prudent for regulators to anticipate what's different when you have crypto currencies being traded in volume versus having traditional kinds of financial instruments traded in volume. But that's--that's the kind of problem they're used to dealing with. Again, we didn't deal with it particularly well back in 2008, but I think we have a lot more tools now for doing it. </p><p>DARROW: I have two points to make on these along these lines. So one, monetary policy is not a goal, like having monetary policy is a tactic. The goal is for people and businesses to have currencies that are a good unit of account medium of exchange store value. Monetary policy is one tool among many that we can use to achieve that goal. Cryptocurrencies provide consumers with an alternative. And like generally speaking, if someone tells me that it's in my best interest to not have a choice between the thing that they're offering, the thing that someone else is offering, I'm skeptical of that claim, right. So only people in Venezuela are skeptical of that claim, right. </p><p>So if cryptocurrency undermines Venezuelan monetary policy, that's probably a feature, not a bug. Second point is that sort of--I've heard frequently this argument that, you know, the financial crisis happened and also cryptocurrencies look sort of like financial instruments so we should be really sceptical. But for--I think you give us way too much credit as an industry. Like cryptocurrency is just not operating at a scale where it's creating systemic risks, today. </p><p>I think drawing that parallel loosely is cash cryptocurrency in a pretty unfairly negative light and making the connections more directly to the types of risk that's introducing instead of saying that it might introduce risks is a better balance between innovation and sort of caution. </p><p>CARTER: Yeah, to Ian's point, you know, Bitcoin today is worth something like $150 billion in the aggregate, that's what is that, a sixth of the market cap of Apple. You know, so it's--it's miniscule in the grand scheme of things. The last survey data I saw showed that about 8 percent of Americans had owned cryptocurrency at some point. So we're talking about relatively small penetration here. And then, you know, the other thing--to Kevin's point about, you know, the financial crisis in part was--was--was due to our inability to account for risk in the system. </p><p>One of the interesting features that people really liked about cryptocurrency and public blockchains is that, you know, you have this really replicated ledger where everybody is staying in consensus over, you know, the state of the world essentially. You know, some people call that triple entry accounting but really it just means, you know, everybody has to be aware of the same state of affairs as far as the ledger and--and the distribution of ownership goes. That allows through some really nifty characteristics like exchanges or their --we have these things in crypto-land called exchanges. They're essentially banks. You can, you know, if they wanted to, they could prove their ownership of the, you know, Bitcoins or the Ethereum or something else held on deposit cryptographically in a way that allows for extreme certainty on the part of depositors as--as to, you know, what their reserves are. </p><p>And so that's one of the really nice features about cryptocurrency. Of course, if you have lots and lots of financial instruments built on top of that risks definitely emerge but in one sense, since cryptocurrency is a bear asset that you can prove you own to a third party in a, you know, relatively frictionless way, you compare that with gold, it's very hard to audit gold or to--to prove that you--the gold in your vaults is--is legitimate. </p><p>So then we have these big supply chains where every bar of gold has to be authenticated and, you know, has to remain within the walled garden. By contrast, something like Bitcoin or--or cryptocurrency generally speaking, it's very cheap to verify that, you know, some cryptocurrency you're receiving is legitimate, you know, hasn't been counterfeited and it's also cheap to demonstrate your ownership of it to a third party which I would say is a really nice feature. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So but Robert, I have to ask you, how--how are the regulators especially in the U.S.  looking at this and it was interesting, the point that's being made that cryptocurrency certainly have a role in some countries where you might have hyperinflation or other kinds of monetary problems. But what about--what about the developed nations where you do have a very sophisticated financial system. Is there far less of a role for cryptocurrencies in those countries and what are regulators thinking about that? </p><p>BENCH: I was on the side of an industry prior to coming to the Fed. And so, we had a lot of those hard conversation and again, I think the regulators are trying to be careful to what extent, you know, some cryptocurrency at their heart are the fuel that runs decentralized computing, right. So previously, Ethereum is most well-known for that whereby, you know, Ethereum is--effectively enables you to do decentralized computing and so a regulator doesn't necessarily want to stop a technology development, right. </p><p>One thing that's made our country so strong is our consistent push towards technology development and there's been any strong concern by regulators to not de-incentivize development of technology. However, you know, there are some things in the United States to your point, the market cap of all crypto combined is fairly small. Like if--if we exclude stable coins, right, if we exclude stable coins, coins that are not owned directly by any party and are cryptographically secured, it's a very small grouping. </p><p>I mean, the primary concerns are always AMLKYC, right, terrorist financing. A terrorist event you know can have a destabilizing effect. You look at the trajectory this country since 9/11, that was a destabilizing effect on the United States, not a certain monetary standpoint but as a cultural standpoint. That change tell our country operates so we are very adamant about AMLKYC protections. And so, that's something that we're--we are watching. </p><p>And I think the other question is--is, you know, I--I--I guess I'll focus on the market side, but other certain consumer protections we want to be concerned about and I think--I think other regulators, the Federal Reserve doesn't have as much role say as regards the SEC and CFTC and understand the market side of things is--and that's something that they've been very active on and I think they're going to continue to pursue. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Yeah--yeah balancing innovation and protecting the consumer, protecting the--the global economy, it's a--it's a tough line to follow. We have some time here, I know that lots of questions in the audience. Why don't we just open it up for questions and go from there. Yeah please. </p><p>QUESTION: I'm Peter Grasmann from the European Commission. And I want to come back on a question of the first point you made as to whether central buying digital currency is necessary. And everyone said, well, central bank digital currency already exists. But is that really true? Isn't the question should central banks issue tokenized currency, digital bearer instruments? Is there a demand for digital bearer instruments because the current digital currencies, the issue they give it to the banks and the banks leverage it up. So what's your view--your view on that? </p><p>DARROW: My view personally, and I'm channeling Jerry Brito who I'm standing in for this panel, who wrote an amazing paper about the traits that the electronic currency should have is that central banks should do this if they are politically able to do it in a way that respects the civil liberties and privacy traits that cash gives and they shouldn't if they can. I'll defer to Jerry's paper for a further elaboration of that stuff but I think it's politically very, very difficult to create currency--digital currencies that let you spend money in a private way. </p><p>And it's such a fundamental trait of our economy to have the ability to do that, but I think moving everything to a system where privacy and civil liberties are impossible is really, really dangerous and shouldn't be done. </p><p>CARTER: I think that's a really, really excellent point and I wholeheartedly agree. I mean, the risk to me is that a single entity is able to scrutinize and evaluate and--and be opinionated about which transactions, you know, the citizenry is--is allowed to make. And in some countries, that, you know, I guess that's okay, that's sort of part of the social contract. But in the U.S. , you know, we've always had this commitment to--to physical cash. </p><p>You know, and--and to some degree, autonomy in transactions and there's an interesting thing happening, you know, as we move towards, you know, totally digital economies where cash is de-emphasized or if we move towards cryptocurrency land where virtually everything is public that transactional autonomy and privacy is obliterated and we've had this subtle shift, you know, where--where if you went to a bank and you deposited cash, you weren't asked what the last five transactions were with the physical bank note. </p><p>However, if you deposit a cryptocurrency in an exchange, what they will do is they'll evaluate the--the last, you know, X money hops to see whether it was associated with some--some risky activity. So we've in some sense even though cryptocurrency be, you know, promises, you know, to restore individual auto--autonomy to some degree, it risks doing the opposite. And right now, we--we don't really have a wave transaction--transacting digitally which does respect individual privacy in to the extent that's possible, you know, along with other like policy objectives. So I--I am little bit nervous about CBDC. if it means that a government could in a very cheap way enact wholesale surveillance and control over individuals. </p><p>WERBACH: Well, it certainly we're going to see that in China because that's their agenda. This is really the big philosophical question. It is their sufficient demand for a truly bearer instrument something that's truly user based and--and can't be done in a way that does protect sufficiently against financial crime, terrorist financing and so forth. So I think those are very legitimate objectives and that's what regulators push on and that's--that's sort of the practical discussion we need to have is how possible is it to sufficiently prevent money laundering or other kinds of financial crime while still providing that protection and independence to the end-user. </p><p>And then, the philosophical debate which you know I don't think we have enough is as a principle, how important is that and how concerned are we about the kind of creeping surveillance society we've entered into, not just from the government but from the private sector as well. </p><p>QUESTION: Morning. thank you very much for--for an excellent panel so far. My name is Sameer Gulati, I represent the U.K. government and specifically the U.K. government's Department for International Trade. My question is--is sort of where are we going with this? So there's a huge amount of interest, obviously, from governments around the world both on sort of crypto assets, stable coins, et cetera. You know what are the potential areas where you see the future of this going and specifically, what's the role of fear in the future? </p><p>My view is certainly that obviously we need to take a very clear view of what stable coins are, where does the regulatory perimeter sit. But I'd be very interested in the panel's views on kind of where--where do you see things in five years' time? </p><p>CARTER: I can take a stab at that. There's a--there's a growing view among some academics that since 2009, you know, with the emergence of Bitcoin there has been that reopened kind of free--free market for money so to speak. And my guess is that it imposes a sort of monetary discipline on some of the central banks around the world. </p><p>And if we get something like Libra to answer the--the other prong of your question, as Kevin says, that could effectively dollarize some of the weaker economies where Facebook has users because, you know, naturally you'd want to hold a dollar instead of a Nigerian naira or an Argentine peso for instance. So my guess is that some of the weaker monetary regimes feel a lot of pressure in response to this reopening of a free market for money. </p><p>DARROW: I'm not--I'm not sure about the five-year timeline but I'll speak to like a ten year timeline. I do think that in ten years, there will be a widely available sort of user-accessible bearer instrument that has the traits that we care about in currency that's--that's used widely in some geographic region, right. It might not be widely adopted in the United States because like credit cards work pretty well, we don't care that much right now. </p><p>But somewhere where the financial system is a little bit less reliable, I think that will be widely adopted. There's a company called MobileCoin that I like pretty well and their CEO says the thing that's smart which is that that system, when it emerges is going to have a certain set of values encoded in it when it comes to things like civil liberties privacy. And if the United States and the UK and like-minded countries are involved in the creation and shepherding of that technology at its built, we can make sure that values that we like and care about are encoded in the system instead of the values that a different type of government might encode in the system. </p><p>BENCH: You know, I think one next step, the next, you know, five, ten years will be, you know, we talked about how the development of technology has really enabled people to see value, add value is just another data set. And--and as we get--as this technology kind of gets better understood, understand the value of that data itself and what kind of, you know, whether for good or for bad depending on your opinion of it, what kind of value can be extracted from that data whether for private actors or public actors in from nothing necessary, an economic standpoint because economic is going to start with a model but from a data science standpoint what could be found out or understood better about firms and economies as a whole when you kind of fill that data gap, right. </p><p>I think one thing people are looking at is the question of data gaps is payments has become a data gap or compared to everything else in our world, everything else is collected via, you know, tradition of the--traditional Internet but the Internet 2.0, they don't have value, we haven't really done the data science on that yet. And I think there's a lot of smart people working on that both in public and private sector to understand what kind of value they can extract. But also, understand, you know, there's going to be a conflict there of how much data is enough and how much data is too much and then the following step is identity, right. </p><p>I think this--the starting conversation years who are you, how is that defined and who is going to do that, who's going to find who you are? Like the large tech companies define you primarily by your phone number and they do a really good job of it. The government does an okay job with it and I think that's going to be a big key to come out of this is who you are and how that's tracked. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: I suspect that over the 10-year period there'll be some events that will take place that will slow things down, move things in a different direction whether it's hacking or some other event that happens that's just going to push back things. It's not going to be a smooth line going up and that'll end up driving what happens. Yeah, Chris. </p><p>QUESTION: Chris Muller. Just picking up on that thought and--and I know Nic, you've said some really interesting things about this but I'm also (INAUDIBLE) having come in from the business school. I'm interested in just this concept of really the degree to which crypto currencies may or may not transform how we even think about conceptually and from a standpoint of even rigor, sort of economics, right. </p><p>I mean, the not just from the standpoint of discipline on in terms of the issuance of any particular currency but how one goes about thinking about money and--and--and what money is and if there's a redefinition of what money is as you're adding in sort of your traditional sort of instrument of payment, sort of value, unit of account. But now, when you start to add other kinds of functionalities either through program ability or through creating sort of networks and ecosystems through a payment system, this sort of transforms your--your traditional concept of what money is even as you may be moving towards different forces of discipline that we tend to associate with, you know, your--your--your existing gold standard. </p><p>And maybe if the folks on the panel could really talk about like what does the introduction of a digital currency mean for, you know, how we think about economics and money. I think it'd be really interesting and I'll appreciate it. </p><p>BENCH: I'll briefly go to what you mentioned which was the programmability. I think that's gonna be something really interesting. Now, I think we talked earlier how policymakers really did not want to stifle innovation but wanted to ensure consumer protections. The programmability of money and things you can do, I think is yet to be seen from a large scale standpoint and technologists, you know, after working into high tech firm, like technologies are going to build. you know, with regardless of the regulatory environment, technologists will build things and they're going to try to solve problems. </p><p>And so, I think this programmability of money will lead technologists to solve problems and I think the question for us as policymakers is usually, how--how do we direct that in a way that meets our meets our policy goals but also enables technologists to build things that solve real problems? </p><p>WERBACH: Yeah, this is a very, very old question. I mean, Aristotle wrote about what money is, John Locke wrote about what money is, Adam Smith wrote about what money is. That's even before dozens and dozens of books by modern economists, philosophers, anthropologists and others. The technology is something that realizes an example of money in the real world and then, that becomes data that we can use to--to theorize and experiment around. But we're still going to have huge debates. Is--this issue we've just talked about--about bearer instruments. </p><p>If you think that money is a thing, then money ultimately has to be a bearer(ph) instrument. But if you think that money is a set of credit relationships that essentially is just a unit of account, well then, you don't necessarily have to have any kind of thing but you can think about them, the blockchain as the ledger that's recording those different relationships. </p><p>You know, there have been debates about this for centuries and we now have again, something that's going to change the way this manifests itself in new and flexible ways. And so, you know, economists may be getting it wrong in some ways that cryptocurrencies will allow us to see better. You know, but--but basically the idea underlying economics that people respond to incentives under conditions of scarcity, that's still a useful paradigm for understanding what's going on. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: We have more questions over here somewhere. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah, hello. I would like to ask you one question. So my name is Cleopatra, I come from BCB. I was wondering currently the status quo of the financial system in terms of transactions is not satisfactory. There are--it is very expensive to do transactions. Sometimes, even domestically not even, you know, across borders. At the same time, there are millions of people who are unbanked and who do not have access, this financial inclusion is not there for a great part of the global population. And these things are important for potential growth and outputs to recover especially currently that we have this global slowdown. </p><p>So if you don't see the solution in Libra and if you think that Libra is not going to fly, and if it's not going to be some kind of central bank digital currency even a synthetic one like the Bank of England was suggesting, then how do you see--how do you see the role of fintech and how do you see solutions in this particular problem? Thank you. </p><p>CARTER: Well, I know some of us have expressed skepticism around Libra and we're going to see some of our congressmen express the same today. But I do think it has actually a very good chance of launching and my guess is that it's probably the best hope actually for--for something like cryptocurrency or resembling cryptocurrency, you know, cryptocurrency adjacent to actually be a force for potent financial inclusion. Especially, if they, you know, they meet the criteria such that the regulators are comfortable with them launching. So far, in cryptocurrency land, there have been many projects which have been promised to bank the unbanked and for the most part, they've been dismal failures. </p><p>Even Bitcoin is only owned by you know tens of millions of people worldwide and in practice, isn't--isn't that useful. So we're going to need probably a tech firm or, you know, some other entity to design a way to use the digital bearer asset in a way that's user friendly which potentially Facebook and the Libra consortium could do. </p><p>So my guess is that they are actually the current best hope for financial inclusion, although, of course, there's a lot of risk there. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Yeah, I think that's a really important and goal to try and solve in some way. Another example of that is the role of fintech in remittances or it which--what--it was so expensive to send money especially when you're talking about small sums of money; $20, $30, and the fee that was getting charged. So I think broadly, fintech is playing a pretty big role in bringing down those costs and making it easier to send money across the countries, across borders. Other questions? Yeah, back there, please. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you so much for the excellent discussion. My name is Timi Agama and I'm from the Nigerian SEC. I heard him talk about the Nigerian naira, the peso and, you know, it was interesting. But clearly, one of the thoughts process around it is possibly the existence of cryptocurrency, could be as a result of the failed monetary system or whatever, you know, along that--the line--thoughts of--line of thoughts. </p><p>How--my question clearly goes this way, in Nigeria we have one of the largest or highest volume of peer-to-peer transactions on cryptocurrencies today as we speak. That is within a population of between 18 and 35 years old which runs--runs around 60 percent of the Nigerian population which is about 203 million. That tells us significant that is. </p><p>The challenge we have there is one how to mitigate the risk arising from those transactions because for those people that are doing those transactions, a lot of them actually do not know what cryptocurrency is. They are all joining the bandwagon of trying to make a profit from the transaction rather than using it for a--for a solution to a problem. </p><p>So now have the risk of possibly anti-money laundering, movement of cash illicitly, and you don't have a possible record of such transaction. So the challenge again is cryptocurrency within Africa or the emerging markets or frontier market has created a loophole for lose money movements which is a challenge to the financial--global financial system. how do we deal with such because we need so much education for those sets of people, you know, as different from the developed economies a developed world where a lot of people know what they are talking about. </p><p>For these people, they don't just know anything. If you ask them, just by my street, I was working out, I saw--I heard somebody talking about cryptocurrency. The person was undressed, sitting, you know, by the roadside with a computer and of course, he doesn't really know what the risk are and the challenges around it. So how do we deal with such a situation? </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Yeah, this obviously tends to be a major challenge certainly in emerging markets and education is one piece and information, disclosure of information, transparency in the process, that--that really becomes key and this is what regulators are concerned about. </p><p>WERBACH: Yeah, absolutely. And I think you've given the best argument why what Nic said a minute ago is true, where he said he thinks Libra is going to launch or and also things like Libra will launch. The alternative to what you've described is a stable coin. So people aren't speculating on it for the investment value and something that's regulated. </p><p>So there are mechanisms to monitor for financial crime and to ensure consumer protection while still allowing people freedom over their transactions. That's the--the case for something like the vision that Libra has articulated it's not just Facebook. Many--many others are thinking along similar lines. And so, I--I think that will be one reason even though, there's all the regulatory consternation, legitimately going on right now that we will see the emergence of retail CBDC-like instruments especially in those parts of the world where the alternative is--is basically to leave it to these--the cryptocurrencies in this unregulated way which--which is not going to serve policy ends. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: One last question over there. I know you've been trying to raise your hand for a while now in the corner there. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, my name is Amir, I'm with Accenture and this is actually just something building off of a previous conversation yesterday in the financial inclusion panel. But with the idea of currency as a whole and like you guys talking about the idea of transitioning over to digital currency rather than fiat or just paper currency, I was very curious about just the transition in correlation with India and specifically de-monetization. </p><p>With that coming up like there was definitely a push back against the idea that cash is king in a lot of developing markets and I figured this honestly gave a little bit of an opportunity to really push that forward a little bit more just because there isn't the stability and the comfort as much with currency that's more tangible. So I was just curious if you guys had any thoughts and also how this could carry forward into other countries such as China for example that has a significant shadow banking market. Thanks. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: So the de-monetization in India, I think that would be another example of sort of good intentions but not properly executed. And because of that, I think governments will slow down a little bit in how aggressively they push. There--those are kind of example that's talking about that it's not going to be a smooth path, but when you try to do something and it doesn't get executed very well, then there's a push back and then you've got to slow down about your next steps. And so, that is in the direction of moving towards paperless, cashless society, and--and trying to take care of some of the issues that you talked about with the AML, and KYC and they're supposed to address those issues. I think this is another direction, another push in that direction. </p><p>WERBACH: Yeah, it's a question of trust. If--if people don't trust the government, then technology is not going to make them trust it better or trust it to implement some change in the monetary system. the--the question is can we make this phase transition away from trust in central authorities which might be public authorities like central banks or it might be private authorities like Facebook to a trust in the technology and the algorithms and the concepts underlying a cryptocurrency like system. That's--that's the reason that people are willing to see something like Bitcoin as money because they can understand the cryptography and they can understand that it is a trustworthy system. </p><p>It's a big leap but it's a really important leap and a really powerful leap and that's I think really what the--the whole question with crypto assets is about is where is that leap going to happen where communities are willing to accept that this is trustworthy, because it provides the--the kinds of guarantees that are necessary without having to trust a central entity. That's a very hard thing for public authorities in particular to accept and they appropriately want to ensure that their policy objectives are met. But I--I think ultimately the benefits are going to be so great that we're going to see the dam break at some point we will see government's recognize that you can build a system that is trustworthy because of the technology and then eventually, that's what's going to win out. </p><p>AGGARWAAL: Well there's lots to come. We'll wait and see what happens in the next few years. But please join me in thanking our panelists here. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>NOLAN: Yes, yes, thank you Reena and the panelists for kicking off today. </p><p>It was a very interesting conversation but there is a lot more to come. So, our next panel is gonna be focused on stablecoins and the financial infrastructures. Moderating this panel will be Patrick McCarty. Patrick is the Founder and President of McCarty Financial and a Professor at Georgetown Law. So, Patrick, I'll turn it over to you. </p><p>MCCARTY: Great, who wants to go up here first? Alright, there we go. </p><p>OLESKY: Thank you. Okay. </p><p>BOGGIANO: Can we switch places? </p><p>OLESKY: Yeah, sure. </p><p>MCCARTY: Welcome Alex. </p><p>LIPTON: Thank you. Right on time delivery, Grant. </p><p>MCCARTY: Just on time delivery. </p><p>LIPTON: Yes, that's right. I made it. </p><p>MCCARTY: I'm looking out in the audience and I see everybody's ready for us. Thank you very much, I'm Pat McCarty, and we're going to basically start the next session panel on stablecoins and financial market infrastructure. I'm not gonna go through everybody's bios, but I will introduce them as we go through, just to make sure you know who's who. It's pretty simple here, Kristin Bajan--Boggiano, Boggiano? </p><p>BOGGIANO: Boggiano, it's fine, really. </p><p>MCCARTY: Pardon. </p><p>BOGGIANO: I like Bogiano, or whatever. </p><p>MCCARTY: Chief Legal Officer at Alpha Point. And we move on to John Olesky, he's the Managing Director and Co-head of the loan platforms at IHS Markit. Then we're gonna move on to Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli,  Deputy Division Chief, at the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, at the IMF. We have as well, Tony McLaughlin, from Emerging Payments and Business Developments Treasury and Trade Solutions, at Citi, and finally last but not least, we have with us Alexander Lipton, Chief Technology Officer at Silamoney, and Connection Science Fellow at MIT. I hope I got that right, Alex. </p><p>LIPTON: Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah. </p><p>MCCARTY: Perfect. We really have a great panel here, and I really have to congratulate Chris Brummer on putting together such a--a fine group of people. All of these people are experts in the field, they are gonna give us everything we need to know about stablecoins and possibly on GSCs, before the end of the day, here. I'd say that it's kind of an interesting thing to--to have a conversation with so many well-accomplished people. And so, we're gonna be going through a variety of the issues just so people know in advance what will be coming. </p><p>We're gonna try to talk about what stablecoins are, and what the subset of them in terms of global stablecoins might be, which the G7 report just talked about. We're gonna look at the potential benefits and use cases, we'll then talk about the risks associated with GSCs, and then the relevant legal regulatory and oversight frameworks and finish up with the future of GSCs. And just before we start into the questions and comments that we get from our panelists, you have to keep stablecoins in perspective. </p><p>Digital asset market is very small, relative to other markets that we have. There are 3,000 tokens that exist today, and they're actually growing every day. The market cap is about $220 billion dollars, which is really very small, relative to most of our established markets, it is growing, however. I would point out, it's an interesting thing, the average daily trading volume in the FX Market as reported by BS--BIS in September is $6.6 trillion dollars a day. When you look at the digital asset space, we're only talking about $50 to 60 billion dollars a day. </p><p>Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the most actively traded digital asset. The most actively traded digital asset is stablecoin, U.S. dollar tether, and it's about $20 billion dollars a day. So that's where the size and shape of this is at the moment and when we talk about stable coin, we're gonna look at sort of some of the uses and the differences, because it's--it's important to remember you shouldn't group all stablecoins together, they're not all the same. And based on that I think we should move on, and talk to Kristin about that. Can you give us some idea as to stablecoins, the variety, the shape and what global stablecoins look like if they're a subset of that? </p><p>BOGGIANO: Sure. It's interesting, so Alpha Point is a technology company that powers exchanges, it's the technology behind a lot of the exchanges and I see a huge demand for--for stablecoins. And I--I guess I--I had to ask myself why--you know, and I know we'll get into the taxonomy in a second, but for people in other countries that are looking for stability, the frictionless, the ability to take--you know, not have to open up a bank account and try to convert to USD, to just go into tether--you know, to--to go and take your local currency, go to an exchange and flip it to something that's more stable is a very attractive feature. </p><p>So, I think that's why there's a significant amount of demand for it. But what are stablecoins in the taxonomy? And I have experts here that really understand and there's so many different words we can use. But when I think about it, I think \"Okay, what is a stablecoin?\" It's something that's either backed directly or indirectly by another currency, so USD, Euro--let me stop--who has--who has purchased a stablecoin in this audience? </p><p>MCCARTY: Not many. </p><p>BOGGIANO: So, not many, maybe--maybe five. So it's something that's backed by USD or a currency, something that's backed by a commodity, so gold or--you know, some other real estate, I've seen real estate, something that theoretically is backed by another cryptocurrency so something--where a smart contract--you know links to another crypto or theoretically it's something that's backed by an algorithm, it's not backed by anything at all. So stablecoins can--can vary. I don't know if any of my co-panelists wanna talk about the taxonomy because there are very interesting--you know, concepts that are developing. </p><p>MCCARTY: Mr. Tommaso? </p><p>MANCINI-GRIFFOLI: Yeah, I can--I can have a go. We--we offered a bit of a taxonomy of stablecoins and other digital forms of money in a recent paper called The Rise of Digital Money just published at the IMF, with Tobias Adrian. I think when it comes to stablecoins, there are various criteria that are relevant. One is the denomination of the coin. So, is it denominated in a common unit of account, like the U.S. dollar or the Euro? Or is it dominated in its own unit of account? Libra for instance, is denominated in its own unit of account. Then the question is whether it has a face value, that's an important question. </p><p>So, if it's denominated in the U.S. dollar, does the coin have a face value? If you give ten dollars to the coin issuer, do you get a coin that says ten dollars on it? That's fundamental, because then you can ask, \"Is there a redemption pledge? Can you redeem this coin for U.S. dollars at face value?\" If you can, perhaps that is important to you, that brings greater stability to the coin, as long as the coin is backed fully with $10. So, the third element that we look at is, what are the backing assets, what is backing that pledge to redeem into a Fiat currency? Ultimately, that makes for a more stable coin, but of course there are other approaches. Some approaches do not have a face value and redemption is not at a fixed pre-agreed value. Redemption is in whatever the going value is of the underlying assets. </p><p>That's much more similar to an--what we call investment money. It's almost like holding a share in an investment fund whose value varies over time. A bit more risky to users. So, I think stablecoin, the word stablecoin is--is unfortunate because it encapsulates so many different types of designs, so many different types of--or levels of riskiness to the user. Riskiness in terms of volatility of the price in a common unit of account. At the end of the day, you wanna be able to buy goods with this that are denominated in your domestic unit of account. So again, we--we offer kind of a--a tree to think about different designs of stablecoins that has various key criteria, that emphasize the great--key criteria such as: denomination, redemption pledges and the nature of the assets backing that redemption pledge. </p><p>MCCARTY: Thank you, Tommaso. Let's talk a little bit about use cases, Alex, I'm wondering what--what type of effective use cases do you find for stablecoins and GSCs out there and can you give us-- </p><p>LIPTON: Yeah. </p><p>MCCARTY: Some ideas on that? </p><p>LIPTON: My colleagues and I have been thinking about things like that for quite some time now, and in both more theoretical direction as well as practical direction. At Sila Money, we're actually building a stablecoin which is naturally called Sila, which is aimed at producing regulated payments on--on the web. And then, with my--my IT colleagues we have been thinking about digital trade coin, you might have seen--you know, Libra's white paper, so it's essentially--you know, kind of a variation of what we have written two years ago and very--you know very close similarity if I may put it this way. </p><p>And the ideas of why you need a stablecoin--you know, are simple right? So essentially when Internet was designed and developed and by the way, I want to use this opportunity to point out that it was a kind of government project--you know, whatever various fintech and I've--whatever various technical entrepreneurs right now say that only they can develop--you know, true originality and so on, it's simply not true. You know, Internet is an offshoot of a Cold War thinking of creating on unbreakable possibilities for communication during the attack by the adversary. </p><p>So anyway, so when Internet was created and eventually it did develop by the private sector, what was missing there, this protocol of money and identity. If they were there, we would have a completely different world right now. But in fact, there are placeholders, but no actual implementation. So, in our mind--you know, stablecoin, fuels to a large degree the kind of--this placeholder for money. Identity is a different story, and a very big one which needs to be resolved by itself--you know, before we can kind of go any further in this direction. And then you know there's digital trade coin which we were designing at MIT, and now kind of starting to implement a variety of variations. </p><p>That is something which we thought over the counterbalance to dominant currencies like the dollar for example, which would be actually outside of purview of any particular central bank and more balanced and so on, and so forth. So, I--I do see two directions. One is, to complete the Internet protocol by providing a--you know, money on the Internet and the second one is to create an offset to whims and strategies of any one particular central bank, that's how I see. </p><p>MCCARTY: Thank you, John--thank you Alex. John, can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing with stablecoins in the market loan business that you've been in? </p><p>OLESKY: Yeah, sure. You know, one thing I wanna make sure is not lost is--you know, obviously great writing by--by Tommaso and Tony, everyone should read what they've written. </p><p>BOGGIANO: --100 percent, really interesting.-- </p><p>OLESKY: --It creates a very clear, very clear taxonomy, all of you can take examples that you've seen and say \"Where does this land? Oh, it's E-money, oh it's B-money, oh, it's I-money et cetera. Stablecoin of course, is a--I agree it's an unfortunate term, I think anything that has the word stable in it, makes you feel like someone has to try to make it stable, but maybe risk coin doesn't have the same ring as stablecoin? But from our standpoint--you know, we operate in markets, certain I do, markets that--that don't have central counterparties or clearing houses, ones that--that essentially would not have a--a delivery versus payment or DVP-like model like you would have in other asset classes. </p><p>So, we see the opportunity to use a digital representation of Fiat to create velocity and ultimately connect the legal transfer of assets with the payment. So essentially creating settlement finality, reducing post-settlement reconciliation and a lot of those types of things. And certainly, you know, the--the syndicated loan market has been--been in the news quite a bit. Some of the speakers coming up later have--have some opinions on that. And we see a real opportunity to create something that is modern, is faster and ultimately, has the capability taking that single dollar, that single unit of account and use it many times throughout the day, rather that what ultimately happens today which is if you receive a wire, you're probably not sending it outbound for an outbound obligation. Today, we see velocity, simplicity and ultimately, we have to adhere to the E-money standards that these gentlemen have defined. So, you have to be a licensed issuer, you have to be able to issue them at par, they have to be fully redeemable by anyone, so all of those coming things that people would expect. So, it is stable, but we generally don't call it stablecoin, we just call it Fully Collateralized Digital Representation of Cash. </p><p>BOGGIANO: That's long, Fully Collateralized Digital-- </p><p>OLESKY: I may have extended it to make it sound more impressive, it's just digital stuff, let's just-- </p><p>BOGGIANO: Digital stuff. </p><p>MCCARTY: Is--is your--have you launched this or is it, you know-- </p><p>OLESKY: Well, when-- </p><p>MCCARTY: --When do you expect?-- </p><p>OLESKY: Washington takes--is not always superfast like we're used to on the street. So, I mean, our expectation is that--you know, second quarter of next year we'll--we'll launch it as a full capability with obvious extensions into other assets classes, I think. The core model of using a smart contract to connect the asset transfer workflow with payment is--is applicable to so many different cases, and we've built our platform to accommodate future growth. </p><p>MCCARTY: Thank you John, Tommaso, so going back to you on this, so you've recently written on digital currencies, and we're shamelessly promoting your paper which is so good, in fact John told me this before we got up here, he said how good it was, so you should read it. One, we'd like to know, since you've been involved in the G7 working group on GSC what are your--the main risks that you associate with GSC what are--what are the really, the big concerns that the international community have about that? </p><p>MANCINI-GRIFFOLI: Yeah-- </p><p>BOGGIANO: Does everyone know what GSC stands for? </p><p>MANCINI-GRIFFOLI: Global Stablecoins. Global Stablecoins, so these are stablecoins that have a global adoption, introduced by big tech firm for instance, that already has a very large installed base, but not necessarily. And the risks that we've been running--writing about at the IMF are multiple. So, besides the benefits of stablecoin, we recognize that there are large potential benefits, we also point out very significant risks. These risks are to consumer protection to start with. </p><p>So, remember that stablecoins are backed by assets, they're a private--liability of a private firm, backed by private assets. So multiple risks, one that the issuer defaults and two, of course, related to the assets that back the coin. So market risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, you are exposed to those risks as a user, and the question is whether you understand fully those risks, whether you can get your money back in the case of default of the issuer, whether you really have a legal claim or not against the underlying assets of the stablecoin, those are important risks to consumer protection. </p><p>Now of course, if consumers start to have a doubt as to their ability to redeem, remember we spoke about the importance of redemption in defining stablecoins, there could be a run on stablecoins. And a run on stablecoins could induce large sales of assets and precipitate prices of those assets, that has financial stability implications. Financial stability implications are also related to the disintermediation of the banking sector. You currently hold your money in various instruments, including bank deposits and that's swath you use to make payments. </p><p>If you start to make payments with stablecoins, you might move your money out of a bank account, that would reduce the funding of banks, certainly the stable and cheap funding of banks and that could have financial stability implications as well. We believe that banks have means to fight back of course, and to retain customer deposits by increasing interest rates on deposits and offering better payment services, but there is the potential for a large disintermediation of the banking sector, that's financial stability. </p><p>We also very briefly speak about integrity risks, so risks to anti-money laundering and countering the--the financing of terrorism, risks to privacy, risks of creating new monopolies. We have to understand that these providers, these large providers of stablecoins operate almost like natural monopolies because of the very strong network effects, like the fact that you use these coins, it makes these coins more useful for me, that's the network effect and the fact that there are very large sum costs to developing these platforms makes these new monopolies very hard to regulate. </p><p>And finally, I'll just raise the risk which was discussed before as a--as a benefit although countries see it as a major risk, and that is the risk of currency substitution. If you're in a country with--with high inflation, volatile exchange rates, weak institutions, you might want to hold the dollar more easily through the intermediary of a stablecoin provider. If that's the case, that country loses, if that's the case on a large scale, that country loses its ability to influence monetary policy. That's a problem to the country, it may not be a problem to the citizens of that country, but it's a problem to that country. </p><p>So, lots of risks that come up, some of which can be tackled by existing regulation, some of which will have to be tackled by new regulation, and some of which are just difficult to tackle with regulation, period, like the risk of currency substitution. So, we need to think about as the international community think about ways to assuage those risks as well. It's not easy. </p><p>MCCARTY: Thank you very much. Tony, Citi Bank has drafted, and it's you I guess, a number or reports related to digital assets including an excellent piece of stablecoins. </p><p>OLESKY: And great videos on YouTube, go watch Tony. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCCARTY: What's your current thought on some of the regulatory issues that are relevant-- </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: --Yeah.-- </p><p>MCCARTY: --For stablecoins and GCS is our new acronym that we've got? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, thanks for the question and thank Chris, for the invitation to be here. So, I think we have to understand the--the significance of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency project. And if you like the cryptocurrency obviously was kicked off by the Bitcoin whitepaper and it's really talking about world of no assured, decentralized currencies without--you know, with--which is censorship resistant. That project is not achieved with--these cryptocurrencies have not achieved the status of money, they don't fulfill the functions of money. And the significance of stablecoins is simply, the idea that if we make these things less volatile, then suddenly they will cross the Rubicon, and we will be able to have stable--cryptocurrencies that perform the functions of money. </p><p>So that's the thesis. I think it's a very weak thesis, because there are other considerations about whether stablecoins are desirable as a form of money, that--that are prior question. And the most basic question is this: do we want to return to a world of bare bearer instruments? Because there's kind of a consensus that bearer instruments are really bad, from a financial client perspective and also pretty inefficient from a processing perspective. So, the idea that we want to transition, in order to fix payments, that we want to transition from a world of double-entry bookkeeping to a world of tokenization is a fundamentally flawed idea. </p><p>And I would argue that if we get rid of this, if we move to a world of stablecoins, if we move the financial system to a tokenized economy, we're soon gonna realize the wonders of double-entry bookkeeping. So, let's--let's examine the assumptions underlying this project. The thesis is this: payments is broken, therefore we need stablecoins. Now what is it about stablecoins that apparently fixes payments? And here's the thing that it fixes: payments you can break down into two layers. In the world of double-entry bookkeeping there's the messaging layer and the settlement layer. </p><p>And those things are separate. If I want to make a payment, I send a message to your bank, your bank pays you, and then I've got to settle with the bank. So, the messaging and the settlement are separate in world of double-entry bookkeeping. In a world of crypto, the messaging and the settlement are together. And the reason why they're together is because it's a better instrument. But the benefit of the messaging and settlement being together in a bearer instrument is vastly outweighed by all of the inefficiencies and the risks of bearer instruments. </p><p>So, the fundamental question is this: what kind of financial system do we want? Do we want one based upon double-entry bookkeeping or do we want one based upon tokenization? Just look at the nightmare of crypto custody, the ridiculous lengths that people have to go to custody crypto assets in cold storage, do we want a financial system that's build upon those types of practices? I think not. </p><p>LIPTON: May I have a little bit--I actually agree to--to a large extent with Tony, but I want to point out that the ultimate a bearer instrument is actually hard cash on the nail, and you know, say what you want, but it is super-efficient and possesses a lot of positives as well as we all know kind of a lot of negatives. So, in my mind at the very least, you known people should have an ability to use cash, in the Internet era, which they don't have at the moment for all these reasons which I mentioned earlier. </p><p>And so, rather than--you know, switching the entire payment edifice into--you know, kind of a stablecoin living on--on Blockchain, we should try at least--you know, and see what happens if we move a large chunks of cash based payments on the blockchain using stablecoins. That doesn't struck me as a particular kind of controversial way of thinking about it, no? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: There's a--but there's a particular--there's a big difference between cash and a digital asset. There's only so much cash I can stick under my mattress. There's only so much cash I can stuff into a briefcase. </p><p>LIPTON: Right. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: There's an unlimited amount of digital assets I can--I can put on a USB stick. So-- </p><p>LIPTON: --Well, why provided that you have enough to buy it with, right? So, this is something which is unlimited in theory but not in practice, huh? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well in--in--well if it's unlimited to how much you can buy, then the criminal elements have got quite a lot of purchasing power for these digital assets. So we've--we already see--you know Bitcoin hasn't made it as a currency but we already see and even multinational entities multinational companies, I had a multinational client ask me \"Hey I've got some trapped cash in Nigeria, I can't get it out because of the exchange controls. Can you help me buy Bitcoin so that I can get my money out of Nigeria?\" Of course not. </p><p>So, this is the--this is the crux of the argument, do we want a financial system based upon better instruments, yes or no? And if we move to this because we're all caught up in this technological--you know, and intellectually stimulating idea about technology which can have a--a money without an issuer, we're in great danger of misdiagnosing the real problems, and frankly to my final point payments, domestically and internationally can be fixed without resort to cryptocurrencies. And that story, they say again \"The devil has the best tunes,\" so crypto has all of the airwaves, people are reading about in the front page. For most of my almost 30 years in payments, payments hasn't been a cool subject. And crypto has-- </p><p>BOGGIANO: --Now it's cool.-- </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Crypto--crypto has made it cool, and I would like to make payments boring again. </p><p>BOGGIANO: Well, you do work at Citi Bank. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: But--yeah. </p><p>BOGGIANO: I mean let's just point out that he's speaking from a particular perspective. Like I don't know how munch money they get in the payment process and having to choose pointed systems. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Very modest. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCCARTY: Tommaso, you have a point you wanted to make? </p><p>MANCINI-GRIFFOLI: Yeah, just a brief point and that is, it's-it's important to understand that there are regulatory standard also for know your customer, so-called KYC and other standards to--to enforce financial integrity on providers of stablecoins. So, we shouldn't walk away from this thinking about, if you use stablecoins you're necessarily going to be able to operate without any checks, without any controls and this is--this is an open door to criminal activity. The other thing I'd like to point out is that, in--in the west and the countries where many of us come from, people have bank accounts. </p><p>And it's perfectly fine to transact from one bank account to the other, let's just make it more efficient, fine. In many countries around the world, banking penetration is low, of the order of 20 percent in a lot of countries. The trust in banks is low. And we have to be open to the possibility of new technologies, favoring financial inclusion, allowing people who do not have bank accounts to participate in payments, to save safely and to slowly grow their income over time and their familiarity with payments over time. And we have seen in many countries new technologies including of the stablecoin type have a large impact, positive impact on financial inclusion. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: --The biggest impact sorry, is--is E-money I'm sorry, the biggest impact, you know, hundreds of millions of customers use PTN, Alipay, WeChat Pay, M-Pesa, PayPal, the biggest impact on financial inclusion is electronic money. And--and that is not a bearer instrument. </p><p>MCCARTY: Alright well-- </p><p>LIPTON: Well of that, look if you really go against bearer instrument, let's be absolutely clear, you open society to intrusive controls which might actually come and haunt you in the end, right? So, in reality, the validity or lack thereof of stablecoins can only be decided by--you know, elected representatives who would enact certain laws and decide what to do, right? So we can go back and forth all the way, besides--you know if one were to be pedantic, right, one would point out that the amount of money laundering going through banks is gigantic, and way in excess of what can potentially be--you know, kind of laundered through stablecoin. Without naming any particular names shall we say that one prominent, for lack of a better word, bank in Scandinavia managed to launder way in excess of 200 billion dollars, from one tiny country bordering one bigger country. </p><p>And you know, kind of what would you say about that, right? So they have all controls in the world and in fact--you know, when I was in banking kind of very good reputation, like stellar of Scandinavian property and so on, so forth, while in reality they ended up laundering as I said way in excess of $200 billion. So, what would you-- </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well what I would say is, the counterfactual would be if the whole financial system, it was built on bearer instruments that they--the possibilities for that kind of activity would be greatly magnified and I'll--I'll kind of counteract what I said previously because I've actually got a lot of time for Bitcoin and--and Ethereum, but what I think is that--you know, Bitcoin is to money what Esperanto is to language. Meaning it's an ideological project and there's a small number of people who really care about Esperanto, and a small number of people who really care about Bitcoin. And I would leave them to it, I've got no--I've got no issue with it. But I don't think we should be running the whole financial system on bearer instruments. </p><p>LIPTON: Yeah, no with that, I agree but that will never happen in the first place. What I'm saying is, the same way as cash has a room in the current environment, stablecoin should be having room in the 21st century. They should be controlled, as Tommaso was saying--you know, clearly on-ramping and off-ramping should be going on with a KYC, AML and so on, so forth. AML should be enacted throughout the system, but they should exist, huh, why not? </p><p>MCCARTY: I think we're--we're--it's clear that most of don't like money laundering. I think most of us like privacy and we know that there's a tension between them and there's the--the idea of whether technology can actually help the unbanked and the--the poor and developing countries. I think we're all on that--we're probably almost all of that stuff, or anti it, depending upon what--where we are. But the thing that's important to know, is that write questions to make sure that our panelists have an opportunity to tell us new and innovative things. So, I'm gonna ask Kristin what she thinks about the U.S. regulatory framework related to stablecoins, which I'm dying to hear, because I'm not sure there is one. </p><p>BOGGIANO: No, I don't--I don't think there is, and you know, that's--for--for a lawyer, for a regulatory lawyer, this is really one of the most interesting times that you can live in, because there aren't the answers, you have to go back and ask the questions and--you know, the US--you know, regulatory framework is--is evolving. I think everybody at the agencies and--you know, are truly--really asking the right questions and-and--you know, I started the digital asset legal group in New York, because--you know, as an in-house person trying to answer these questions, we want to get them right. And we have--we--we truly sit around and I'm so grateful for my industry peers and think about \"Okay, what's the right answer and-and--you know, we wanna get it on the right--right side. </p><p>So, when I think of a stablecoin, I think of \"Okay, well what's it backed by? Is it redeemable 100 percent by whatever that is, and if it's 100 percent of currency, I don't believe--and it's redeemable in full, it's a security and if it's 100 percent backed by a commodity, probably not a security. But then you have to apply the Howey test, being managed by third parties and are you expecting a profit, is it not 100 percent backed by--by something. </p><p>And what if it's backed by a crypto--you know? So, all of the question that we've been asking now for--since--you know, continue to apply to--to stablecoins and--and their analysis. And of course, to me and I was a former derivative lawyer,--you know, if it's not 100 percent backed, it sounds to me like it's probably a derivative. So, you know-- </p><p>MCCARTY: I agree with that, and actually kind of the--the question was meant to illustrate the point that we talked about earlier when we talked about the--I guess the money trees that are shown by Tommaso in his paper, it--the details matter in terms of how a particular stablecoin would be regulated and they are not the same. You have some that are private, some that are public, you have some that are fully collateralized, you have some that are not. As it was pointed out, you also have some which you have a right to withdraw and others where you don't. You have algorithms that do things. It's a very, very difficult area, and I kind of wonder the--what--what central banks are going to do, Tommaso, in response to this because it seems as if--you know the--when you say it's a stablecoin that's a beginning of sort of the analysis as opposed to the end. It's a very difficult thing and then are you gonna basically say \"We need to draw certain lines here,\" what--what's the answer? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MANCINI-GRIFFOLI: I don't think we know exactly what the one answer is. I can throw out some--some ideas for discussion and central banks have been thinking increasingly about issuing a central bank digital currency. Essentially, a liability of the central bank that can be put in the hands of the public directly and that the public can use for--to transact. And this is similar to your idea of a digital representation of cash and central banks are thinking about this for a variety of reasons. </p><p>They differ substantially between central banks. Some central banks are thinking about this to decrease cost of cash management, other to--for the stability of the payment system, they're concerned that the payment system with a decrease of cash is increasingly in the hands of large private sector players. They believe that that is risky, they see of course, problems to market contestability to--to entry because of this, and they therefore feel like it's their responsibility to enter this market with an alternative solution. </p><p>Some central banks are thinking about this for financial inclusion purposes, for--to--in order to serve the unbanked as cash use diminishes, and there is--there are very active discussion among central bankers about the possibly of introducing CBDC. Some are thinking about this as an alternative to privately issued stablecoins, that argument may or may not work. I think the arguments that I pointed out earlier are--are sounder. And of course, the question is, how to do this? And so, there is one model where the central bank would control all the steps of the payment chain therefore interact directly with us, offer us a wallet with which we can control the digital currency, offer settlement capacity, manage our data, et cetera, et cetera, all the steps that are involved. Very expensive, very risky for central banks to do this. </p><p>Most central banks are thinking about establishing some sort of public-private partnership where the public sector would interact and interface with us, customer, would choose the technology and evolve the technology over time. That's there the value added of private companies is. And the central bank would--would focus on establishing trust, that's what its--its good at doing through regulation and potentially through offering these companies the ability to back their coins in central bank reserves, making those coins very stable, very liquid. So, these are different models that central banks are thinking about very actively right now, and it's--it's a very interesting time really, to--to be in a central bank and to be advising central banks about this. </p><p>MCCARTY: Thank you very much. Now we're gonna go to an audience Q&amp;A. And I think we've got people out there with-with--you know, microphones. So, if people would like to do that? I guess if you raise your hand, I think we'll have somebody come to you. Before we get to that, I would ask a quick question from our panelist, Jamie Dimon said earlier this week that with respect to Libra \"It's a nice idea, but it'll never happen.\" Do you believe--or are you with Jamie Dimon or not, and I'm gonna exempt Tommaso because he's with the IMF, it doesn't speak to that issue. But Kristin, what do you think, yes or no? Not gonna happen? </p><p>BOGGIANO: --Bad--bad idea.-- </p><p>MCCARTY: Not gonna happen. Okay. </p><p>BOGGIANO: For many reasons. </p><p>MCCARTY: John? </p><p>MCCARTY: With Jamie Dimon on that one. </p><p>MCCARTY: Tony? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Currencies belong to nation states. </p><p>MCCARTY: I'll take that as a no. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Take it how you will. </p><p>MCCARTY: Alex? </p><p>LIPTON: I--I think--okay, so I--partly a waste and partly yes. I don't think it's a nice idea, but I think it will never happen. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I thought it was a good idea. </p><p>LIPTON: Well, my idea was different because the idea was Libra has enormous hole in it, like the--the size of ozone hole over New Zealand that's the thing. You know, the--the problem with Libra is that it is an unimmunized issuance of currency. So, in the developing world where they really claim to help the unbanked and so on so forth, it will actually generate enormous inflation, right? So the amount of money will automatically double and then--you know, I'm not a big fan of a quantity theory of money, and they wrote many times very critically about it, but what is clear is the amount is indeed doubled by a stoke of a pen, the inflation will go up. That's no question about it. </p><p>And so, you know, the--the thing is that Libra cannot really substitute for national currency say, in some developing world just because in order to buy Libra you will have to use national currency and they will not disappear. They will start to be recirculated and so on, so forth. So, I mean, I think Libra will not happen, and I think Libra is a bad idea. </p><p>BOGGIANO: That was a no. </p><p>LIPTON: Yeah, I think so, right. </p><p>MCCARTY: Alright, now for the questions. </p><p>LIPTON: Double never, yes. </p><p>MCCARTY: Right, okay. Good? </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah. So, my question is around if this changes the way cryptocurrencies are traded. And for the frontier markets you find a lot of those changes erupting every day. Then the question comes as to the regulation of such as changes. Is it something that can be regulated? What are the issues that we need to--you know, consider in the regulation of such as changes? </p><p>BOGGIANO: I didn't understand the question. Can you say-- </p><p>MCCARTY: Who would like to approach that? </p><p>BOGGIANO: I didn't quite understand the question, I'm sorry. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Is the question whether or not all these exchanges should be actively regulated? </p><p>QUESTION: Exactly. </p><p>BOGGIANO: I think they will be, I think that's what FATF is for, and--you know, I deal with many countries at this point, and I'm having active dialogues with many regulators in--in various countries that are implementing frameworks, so that there's not manipulation on the exchanges so that there's the proper AML in place, consistent with a--an international standard that was suggested through FATF. </p><p>MMCARTY: They'll probably be treated at a higher level than they are today, in terms of FinCEN and MSB trade--you know regulation to the extent that you're an exchange, a real exchange I think that you're gonna see the standards raised at least here in the United States, that would be my view. Next? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yeah, I mean at the very least for consumer protection I think it's absolutely required. </p><p>MCCARTY: Roughly 33 million Americans own some type of cryptos, saw that number within the last month or so. </p><p>BOGGIANO: The IRS is gonna be very busy then. </p><p>MCCARTY: They are. They've been sending out letters, we--we all known that. Next? </p><p>QUESTION: Thanks Pat, thank you all for what a--for a very interesting conversation. I'm Linda Jeng with Georgetown and I want to ask a question to Tommaso and Tony, when the Bank of England's governor Mark Carney announced that the U.S. dollar is too dominant and that central banks should be allowed to issue central bank digital currencies based on a basket of reserves, how is that different from the IMFs special drawing rights, which is also based on basket of five reserve currencies? And does the IMF have plans to also issue something based on additional currency or--and--and convert SDRs into what you guys have been talking about today? </p><p>And then to Tony, like I think a lot of what's driving the interest in using some kind of stablecoin is, I think just, everyone's interest in being able to use payments in a very easy way. Which means--you know, we should be allowed to transfer payments across borders, in seamless, quick and--and a--a very--you know, fashion that we can have full confidence in. Which banks have traditionally been able to do but you require spreads, which we lose a lot of our--our value when we transfer money from Europe to the US, we lose money in the spreads. </p><p>Also, we have to pay fees to the banks in Europe as well as the receiving banks in the U.S. and vice-versa. Is there a way for banks to--to come up with a better payment system that would make our lives easier-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: There's the question. </p><p>QUESTION: And us wanting to do banking with you? Thank you. </p><p>MCCARTY: There was--there was a lot there. </p><p>UNKNOWN: There was a lot. </p><p>MANCINI-GRIFFOLI: Yeah, so Mark Carney's proposal, in short just so that everybody is on board, Mark Carney in a recent speech that is very much worth reading says that the predominance of the U.S. dollar induces 1) large monetary policy spillovers form the US, 2) high correlations between financial markets and induce--3) induces a financial cycle driven by U.S. monetary policy around the world. He suggests the introduction of this synthetic hegemonic currency which is essentially a basket to try to induce a financial market to develop using another currency than just the U.S. dollar. It's a very interesting idea, it's a relatively old idea going back to kings. It's interesting to continue to think about that, to think about that, not necessary to issue a currency in the U.S. or--the IMF has not plans, let me be clear to enter this--this space and issue a currency based on its basket that it uses for accounting purposes only, and that is DSDR. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:</p><p> So I--I have a response on the--the question which is number one on the dominance of U.S. dollar. The American eagle holds in its hands an olive branch and a clutch of arrows. The greatest olive branch is the U.S. dollar and the greatest arrow is the U.S. dollar, don't release them. So that's my view on the U.S. dollar, also related to the Libra question. And the second thing is that yes, we can fix the payment system without resorting to bearer instruments and talking about this at the IMF tomorrow, if anyone gives me a business card, I'll send you my thesis on this it's called Fiat Currency 2.0. Yes, payments is broken, we have to bring it into the 21st century, but not by reverting to an old technology before the invention of double-entry bookkeeping. </p><p>OLESKY: Yeah, if I could--could add to that as well. You know, I think that's really important. Most of the reason why a lot of us providers are building solutions that use a digital representation of Fiat is because the underlying infrastructure is broken, full stop. It's broken, it doesn't work, it's slow, it's expensive, it doesn't work. Now that being said as we build solutions, we have to prepare for a future where that may be fixed. So, as we plan two, three, five years out, the $100 billion dollar question is, which approach is gonna win? So, from our standpoint, we have to take what's gonna work in the immediate future while also making decisions for Fiat 2.0, crypto, more--more stablecoins or ultimately even privately issued coins that are either fully backed or partially backed. Whatever our clients see as spongeable as payment, we will necessitate--it'll necessitate our--our adoption no question. </p><p>MCCARTY: We're good. I feel sorry for the people upfront because they don't have access to the--the you know people with microphones, so I'm pointing to this gentleman here in the second row. </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>MCCARTY: stand up and--and direct it up here so that-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: We'll repeat it back, if you want. </p><p>MCCARTY:</p><p> --We can respond? Very good. </p><p>QUESTION: I've spent the last part of my career as a compliance director in Europe and I--while you were speaking I looked at the FCA, 'cause it's in the U.K., Financial Conduct Authority it's to use on stablecoins, 'cause I thought it might help. And traditionally, the FCA has led the discussion given the U.K. markets are generally more liberal and flexible about use of products. They have said that they believe that it's E-money, stablecoins and they have already warned the last three months that anything that contains--that they suspect it's unsuitable for retail customers, because in particular for those having ETFs and--and those--and synthetic type products and derivative based products. I haven't read the full statement and I read it very quickly, but the one thing I was very surprised they didn't comment about that the U.K. regulators have had a long history of have using what's called protected terms, so you can't become a bank unless you have a deposit checking license and you can't call it. </p><p>My--my experience having signed off thousands of financial promotions and marketing documents over the years is they wouldn't really like the word stable and coin coming together, because it does seem a contradiction in terms. So, I suspect that most of the European union notwithstanding Brexit, will probably go in that direction, because most of the big markets, in particular Germany and France, are generally very anti type of those types of products, when they involve retail customers. But I thought it would be worth just mentioning. </p><p>OLESKY: Yeah, I think redemption is the key issue there, ultimately. So, when you talk about ETFs, investors wanna be able to make redemption, protect the customer, and the consumer. </p><p>MCCARTY: Next? </p><p>QUESTION: I'm Carol Vanclief and I would like to first of all say that currencies are not sovereign only. In the U.S. alone, going back about 2010-11 we had over 1,000 privately issued currencies in the United States. Now, how many of them were digital, that's another issue, but we have a long history in the United States and in fact, our sovereign currency is only as old as 1865. So, it's an important point. Libra, Libra will happen, I'm very bold on that point. It may not happen exactly in the form that it is right now, but it is the future. The players, many of the players at the table have substantial payments experience, they understand the changes that are happening. </p><p>If you look at Facebook alone, Facebook has been a regulated entity in the payment space for a number of years now, for almost 10 years. Likewise, Uber has its money transmitter licenses. So, they're positioned to move forward, Amazon, Google, same situation. Finally, there is regulatory precedent for regulation of stablecoins in the case of where it can be deemed a true currency. The E-gold case, E-G-O-L-D, for those of you who are not familiar with it, the company was prosecuted in 2008, by the Department of Justice under the--the goal was to set out rules for this wild, wild west of this thing called digital currencies for--and their use for international remittances. It was the first stablecoin, it was 100 percent backed by gold. </p><p>It was not prosecuted for violations and securities laws. It was treated as a money service business, and I think it's very important as we move forward and I know Representative Garcia introduced a bill yesterday or is in the process of introducing a bill that would deem all stablecoins to these securities. We have to be very careful and reserve, the distinction between what's a true currency and what's a security. Thank you. </p><p>MCCARTY: Thank you very much you--you had the last word. We're--we're in overtime and I think that the organizers are going to throw us out. So, thank you very much my panelists for helping us out here. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Well done. </p><p>NOLAN: Yes. Thank you again to Patrick and the panelists for a great discussion and more is coming. So, let's dive right into our next--next panel. It's titled \"Oracles and Trusted Validators, the Good, the Bad and the Future.\" Here to lead the discussion is Gary DeWaal, Special Counsel for Financial Markets and Funds at CAT as a reminder as we all said, we will do some Q&amp;A at the end and Gary, somewhere in the count, up to him. Thanks again. </p><p>DEWAAL: I'm going to let the panelists introduce themselves very, very briefly.  Laura, I want to start with--with you. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Yeah. </p><p>DEWAAL: We're all live. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Great.  Hi, everyone.  So, I'm Laura Navaratnam.  I work at the U.K. FCA.  So, I'm in the innovation division, focusing on policy for new technology. </p><p>MURCK: Great.  Hi, I'm Patrick Murck.  I am the COO at Transparent Systems. I'm also an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University.  I've been a COO, founder, early employee, investor, advisor, board member at fintech startups and digital currency space for a decade.  So, I think I've like worn all the hats. </p><p>BERTANI: Hello, everyone.  My name is Thomas Bertani.  Thank you for having me here today.  The main reason why I'm here on this panel is that I founded five years ago one of the most widely used oracle services on the public blockchain.  So, we have been focusing on this program for a while. </p><p>DEWAAL: And I might add, before we go to Donna, when--when Thomas described himself to me in writing, he described himself as a disruptive technology addict.  So, I think that's a--a good thing.  Donna? </p><p>REDEL: My name is Donna Redel.  I'm probably here because--on the panel because I know Gary for so long, having--having been involved in--in the commodities business but now--now having moved over to blockchain and cryptocurrencies as both a creative course at--at Fordham Law School and also as an angel investor. </p><p>SWANSON: Hey, guys, yeah. (INAUDIBLE) My name is Tim Swanson.  I was actually on the panel last year with Patrick, so maybe--maybe we'll actually spar this time.  I work for a company called Clearmatics, which is based in the UK, and I think they're best known for creating a consortia called USC, which was spun out earlier this year into an entity called Fnality, which is building something similar to a CFTC. </p><p>DEWAAL: Okay, well, thank you, all, and let's--let's start just laying the groundwork before we get into some more controversial topic.  Patrick, when we talk about trust validators, what are we talking about? </p><p>MURCK: So, great question.  I wonder if we'll actually all agree on this panel on that.  I mean, Tim and I are always-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --Do you mean is there a consensus? </p><p>MURCK: Yeah, right, is there a consensus on--on trust validators.  So, Tim and I are always looking for things to spar over, so it was disappointing last year.  I hope we'll do it today. </p><p>SWANSON: Yeah, last year was kind of--. </p><p>MURCK: Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out.  So, trust validators, so that's like one way of talking about miners, right.  So in Bitcoin, you would probably call these people miners.  These are the people who actually form consensus over the state of data in a distributed ledger system, and so, there's a lot of reliance on the way that that consensus is formed and who the actors are that actually validate information, intake information, update stake on the ledger, record it somewhere, and make it transparently available to everybody on the network. </p><p>Is that a fair definition of trust validators? </p><p>DEWAAL: I think that's pretty good.  Why don't you just sort of expand a little bit?  Obviously, you've discussed a proof of work model.  Maybe just talk a little bit about the difference between proof of work and proof of stake. </p><p>MURCK: Sure, so like when we talk about trust validators, as I was saying, they take information in.  They update stake on the network in a shared ledger and then like make it transparently available to everybody.  The method by which they come to consensus on what is or isn't accurate is--there are a number of different methods for doing that, period, full stop, in distributed computing. </p><p>There's a branch, I would say, of distributed computing that has been labeled blockchains, right, which is a weird thing because it's not really a word that means anything, but we'll just pretend it does, right.  And-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --Does the word virtual currency mean anything? </p><p>MURCK: I mean, it's virtually something. </p><p>DEWAAL: That's--yeah, exactly. </p><p>MURCK: Yeah.  So, proof of work is one of those ways, right.  So to say that I get to sign a record in this distributed database, and I can prove that I have sacrificed some resource, right.  In this case, computational work, right, and I can demonstrate that to everybody on the network.  It's clear.  It's easy for anybody to see that I've actually made that sacrifice.  I sacrificed that resource, and that's what gives me the power to add data into this distributed ledger. </p><p>Another way of doing that, which is more recursive, is this idea of proof of stake, which is--usually, there is no real pure proof of stake system.  It's usually delegated proof of stake, but the idea is that instead of wasting computational power and proving that you wasted computational power in order to--to--to validate the--the--your permission to assign data to the network, you can stake your holdings in the token that the network actually generates itself, right. </p><p>So, Tezos is a good example of distributed delegated proof of stake.  EOS is another one that is well-known distributed proof of stake system, where you're actually putting your Tezos tokens or your EOS tokens up, and you're using it as a bond so that if anybody challenges the validity of the information that you posted to that distributed ledger, you will potentially have to sacrifice those tokens, right. </p><p>They can be seized and slashed and burned.  Those are the different terminology for different systems, so--but the key thing is in either case you have to demonstrate some sort of sacrifice of a resource.  And there actually are a number of other different--there's proof of space, like sacrificing hard drive space.  There's all sorts of different ways that people are trying to figure out where you can provably demonstrate that you've spent something in order to generate data and post it to the network. </p><p>DEWAAL: Thank you.  Tim, let's--let's just switch to you a little bit.  So about in December of last--actually, it's not--actually, it was last year.  The CFTC did a RFI, where they asked about ether, and one of the--and one of the areas that they were inquiring about is--is what--are there special concerns about a proof of stake model, are there concerns about securities, or anything about proof of stake that makes it less reliable as a system versus proof of work. </p><p>What are the ideal elements--what are the ideal elements of a consensus system and--and do you think that proof of stake is more or less secure than proof of work?  </p><p>SWANSON: Wow, that's a good question, and I do not represent the CFTC.  I'm sure that the CFTC has the upline on that.  So yeah, it was funny because they-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --Funny, as in ha-ha funny or-- </p><p>SWANSON: --Yeah, it's funny in a ha-ha because the--you put out an RFI, and who speaks on behalf of Ethereum?  Who speaks on behalf of proof of stake?  So, you end up having a variety of different actors across the spectrum.  Some saying that there's no way any type of proof of stake could possibly be secure from those who are, I guess, proof of stake maximalists, who are like, yeah, proof of stake's the only way. </p><p>So, the ideal way is basically to align the incentives to where the--the punishment outweigh--you do not want to be punished on these networks.  So, Patrick mentioned slash and burn, so if incorrectly on one of these proof of stake systems are--are creating some kind of fraud or being a byzantine actor, you will lose.  You'll be penalized some of the coins that you put up for staking.  So, I don't think that there is a consensus around what proof of stake system is the best yet. </p><p>We're certainly allowing the marketplace to--to come up with several--and just to be clear, there is a nuance.  When people say proof of stake, if we look back at--at 2014, people actually put coins on the validator itself.  So, you have like a custody model.  Today, these other--other proof of stake systems, as they're like the market themselves, have moved to a non-custodial model.  So like, Cosmos--I mean, I'm not endorsing any--any of those I just mentioned, but Cosmos is non-custodian, meaning they will create a special link in which they delegate someone to actually vote on their behalf. </p><p>We could go down into the weeds.  So, when--when you put an RFI out like that, if you're a regulator here and you're looking to do that in your own country, just be aware that there is not one set definition, at least as of 2019. </p><p>DEWAAL: Okay, but in--in your view, they were speaking specifically about ether and the migration of ether from a proof of work to proof of stake, and the question was, is that migration going to increase the possibility of a double spend.  Is it easier for folks to do a conspiracy, get together, alter the outcome?  Thoughts on that? </p><p>SWANSON: Sure.  I'm sure I'll get a lot of flack on--on Twitter.  In fact, I posted this the other day.  So right now, the way Ethereum works is based on proof of work, very similar in process, not exactly the same hashing algorithm as bitcoin, but it's--it's roughly--in any given day, you have the same set of players and the same set of manufacturers that provide the semiconductors for generating this hash work. </p><p>You could conceivably get all these guys in a hotel and, you know, bash their knees with--with hammers and, you know, say, hey, why don't you fork the network.  So when we say, you know, what--what are these edge cases and what--what would happen with proof of stake, I believe with Ethereum, they're going to require at least 2 million ether at stake, so 2 million today times whatever the current price is--was it 300-- </p><p>REDEL: --200-- It would be like 200. </p><p>SWANSON: Okay, so $150 to $200, that's $300, $400 million at stake somewhere minimum to turn on this proof of stake system sometime in the next year or two.  I think there's a 4 million number somewhere out there.  So if you look at the--if you look at the math on the amount of money that's spent--that's being staked versus like ASICs that are being used, the question then becomes is which one is actually--ASIC depreciate.  They--they burn out after 12 months or so. </p><p>They're--become E-waste, so that people have made jokes that technically right now proof of work is--is--proof of stake system is just based off of depreciating capital good.  So, there is--I--I think the--no way I'd be able to convince everybody that proof of stake probably involves more money at stake in--in terms of token, but there is some math you could actually do.  And you could do that on any of these--these networks. </p><p>So, the answer to your question, if you're willing to try and spend all this money at staking and then try to do a double-spend, I mean, you could conceivably do it.  The question is, how much would that cost versus the hashing. </p><p>DEWAAL: Got you.  All right, let's-- </p><p>MURCK: --I think--I think one of the issues with proof of stake, though, isn't necessarily is that more or less secure, right, because you could prove that you're staking something either way, right.  You can prove that you've done something or staked something.  The real issue with proof of stake is that it naturally lends to a concentration of wealth in a way that proof of work does too, but it's even more dramatic in a proof of stake system usually. </p><p>Think about the fact that, especially in a system where the developers of the network have pre-mined, in other words, allocated to themselves a large supply of the coins, in a proof of stake system, then they can then stake those coins to prove and--and assign blocks and get rewarded for it.  It's rent-seeking, right.  It's rent-seeking.  You generate more coins for yourself, which gives you more coins to stake in the future, and so, the real issue with proof of stake and delegated proof of stake is that it just exacerbates the problem of wealth concentration and power concentration in these systems. </p><p>DEWAAL: Okay, we're going to dig down some more about that a little bit later.  In the interim, Tom, help us with oracles.  What are we talking about when you think about oracles? </p><p>BERTANI: Yeah, let's say, that when we have applications running on the blockchain, which Ethereum typically referred to as smart contract--they--we--we say that they live in a wood  cabin, because it's impossible for a blockchain application to reach out to anything external to the blockchain itself.  So, the blockchain doesn't really have knowledge of much.  It just really-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --Sort of sounds like me. </p><p>BERTANI: Well, it knows very--very well what's the time, which is something we typically rely on, you know, watches for.  But the blockchain like finds a consensus on this state of the blockchain itself, which is something like mostly around balances or what time is it--it is, just to prevent double-spend.  So, the main reason for blockchains to use and distribute like a decentralized  consensus is to avoid double-spends and find unique shared version of the ledger, which is global. </p><p>The problem is that when we design applications on such platform we are typically in need of real-world data because we want to design applications that react to real-world events.  So, this--this is what oracles do.  Like oracles are--ironically, I often define them as new intermediary in an industry that is trying to get rid of intermediaries.  So, the reason why we need this intermediary is that the blockchain like is not capable to connect to the internet, for instance. </p><p>So, the blockchain is its own network, and it's not connected and cannot really speak with internet data.  So, most of the real-world data that we use today in like critical normal applications is based on what the API is.  So, what the APIs provided by different data sources on the internet, that's, you know, sent out to some planes.  Like what's the temperature or is a flight late, what's the price feed for that specific--specific asset or things like that.    </p><p>The blockchain isn't capable without oracles to--to push--to connect this kind of data to the applications.  So, it's important to have this new kind of intermediary ironically, and this intermediary is critical, as it could potentially create a scenario where you send garbage in, so you have garbage out, meaning that you may send wrong or tampered data to the blockchain, and the blockchain may not be able to notice that this is not, you know, correct, which may trigger, you know, in a very transparent way a wrong payment. </p><p>So, this is what we want to avoid.  So, oracles are like a very critical component that is necessary but typically unwanted. </p><p>REDEL: And I--and I just want to add that, you know, having reliable oracles is said by many to be precluding larger corporate adoption of blockchain and--and other services.  You don't go to oracle school and--and get blessed afterwards and say, you have an MBA in oracle.  And so, these intermediaries for the blockchain and--and certifying what the data is are sometimes in and of themselves unreliable, which is a real problem. </p><p>DEWAAL: Implicitly, though, with a block validation, aren't you validating the--the data that's--that--that's relied on? </p><p>BERTANI: And that's a very good point, as I will say a few years ago there was this conception that potentially, you know, validators may become oracles.  The point is that it didn't happen for a simple reason, which is that the state of the blockchain is something on which you can--you can come to a consensus in a very deterministic way why data is not something which is always deterministic. </p><p>Like if I ask--if I was to ask here what's the temperature right now, I will get very different answers because I'm not saying anything around, you know, the specific location or the unit, the number of decimals, or things like that.  So, data is always something that is somehow trusted.  So, we need to trust data source or an external authority that is basically sharing the data with us.  So, this is not the case with the blockchain, where there is a very simple, you know, mathematical algorithm that could be applied in a deterministic fashion. </p><p>So, that's why validators don't really serve the purpose of oracles, and we need oracles to somehow, you know, push data to the blockchain or provide data on the blockchain somehow so that the applications can, you know, go ahead and use it to have a real--an impact on the real world because if you don't you just have very simple, smart content living there, such as, you know, more or less with, you know--maybe a diverse set of asset-controlled logic, but that's all. </p><p>So if you want to like trigger some external action outside of the blockchain or read data from outside of the blockchain to trigger a payment on the blockchain, you still need an oracle, and it can be the same thing as, you know, the miner or the trusted by validators, I would say. </p><p>DEWAAL: Sure.  Donna, what is the relationship between governance of a blockchain and--and the validation process? </p><p>REDEL: Well, I think, you know, stepping back, one of the key components of any single company, as we know in the--in the real world, not necessarily the blockchain world, is governance, and it--it becomes the same thing in--in the blockchain in any single one of the different projects.  So, if you have organized a governance that is in some way can't be compromised, then you have a blockchain that can be compromised. </p><p>And we have seen, even going back to the Dow, which was the--of course, the seminal report of the SEC in 2017, that that blockchain was compromised by the government--the governance.  You have a very high concentration in almost any one of these projects of ownership and, hence, you have a high concentration of governance. </p><p>And so, until, as we would hear Hinman say, until they are sufficiently decentralized--not to say whether they're secure or not, but until they're sufficiently decentralized in governance, we have an ongoing issue as to the ability of the--of the blockchain and, hence, validators to be compromised.  And I--it's not a--it's not an easy fix at this particular moment. </p><p>DEWAAL: Well, Laura, what have are seeing--what's your reaction to all this of the issues of validators and--and oracles from a regulatory perspective?  What are you seeing? </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Yeah. </p><p>DEWAAL: --From your seat. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: So, it might be quite strange to have a regulator on this kind of a panel, but I wanted to sort of leave the details-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --And we presume you're not decentralized. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: No, no, no, it's really--I guess, you know, there's been lots of discussion around governance, around accuracy, and I think those are things that we--we need to be really careful of.  But to that accuracy point, I think that can impact on trust.  We could quickly become a market integrity concern.  But I would say that actually from a regulatory perspective, there can often be quite a lot of caution and--and a risk-adverse nature to some of these--these new and emerging technologies. </p><p>And I very certainly think we should think about some of the positives and some of the benefits that they bring as well, and I think that's definitely something that regulates the need to continue in these kind of conversations.  We--we issued a--a paper back in 2017 that started to look at some of these permission and permission list networks and actually how that interacts with the--the regulatory framework within the U.K. </p><p>And we--we actually found a lot more positives than we had maybe anticipated, and then actually regulation can be a barrier.  But it's not necessarily the--the design precludes it from being a part of the financial system, and so, I'll talk a little bit more about some of our own initiatives on sandbox and--later on in this session. </p><p>DEWAAL: You can do it--you can do it now.  By the way, if you have not seen the FCA's recent guidance on--on crypto assets, in my review--and I'm not doing this because I have clients that might have to deal before FCA, but frankly, the--the overview that FCA did was one of the best regulatory overviews of--of the crypto space.  They were trying to understand what's within their perimeter--regulatory perimeter.  As a result, they did a really good deep dive on a lot of different products, and I think, you know, credit to--credit to the FCA on that. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Thank you, yeah-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --I'm not sure I agree with your outcomes, but I thought that the analysis was very, very thorough and good. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: But to me--so you know, thinking about that guidance and actually some of the other guidance that we put out in the past, you know, our sandbox model has been incredibly helpful to really get under the skin of some of these technologies and understand where the--where the risks and where the benefits are.  We--we've opened our sixth cohort of sandbox.  We opened that on Monday. </p><p>So again, the same process as--as previously.  One-month applications.  Firms can come to us, and we will--we will consider them.  I think the one thing we've--we've tried to change this time is focus on specific areas where we want to see more--more innovation happening in the market to--to increase competition from the sort of the benefit of consumers, but--but that mechanism is so incredibly important.  And you know, speaking about the--the stablecoin paper in particular, as--as the crypto-asset paper because that has been so recent. </p><p>Actually without the knowledge of the firms coming through sandbox and coming to the innovation division at the FCA and having really honest and open conversations about the regulatory barriers that they are facing, we can't produce the policy that--that we can, and I--and I'm glad that papers like that are being well-received.  And actually, you know, it's been--it was quite a simple paper in some elements because we weren't actually saying, this is where regulation should go in the future and this is where we should change our perimeter to take account of new business models coming down the track. </p><p>We were just saying, this is where it sits at the moment, but I think that clarity is really important for firms to be able to understand this is--this is where we need to start to get to, and actually, regulation shouldn't be always seen as a hindrance.  And the regulators shouldn't always been seen as a--as a blocker to--to new innovation. </p><p>REDEL: Can I ask it to you? </p><p>DEWAAL: Please. </p><p>REDEL: How much do you think the fact that all of your regulation is under one umbrella makes a difference in, A, Gary being able to say that you did a very comprehensive report versus what we might be able to do here?  Was it--was it easier or more receptive to have all of your colleagues in the different areas that they might look at together creating a report? </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Yeah, that's a good question.  I think--I mean, we do--we do have a sort of Twin Peaks model in the UK.  So, we do have to work closely with the Bank of England from a prudential perspective, but I certainly think having those different--those different teams together has really been a benefit.  So, the--the innovation division at the FCA started about five years ago and was about three people essentially providing kind of a helpline. </p><p>So, firms could call up and say, I've got this new idea, new technology.  I want to ask some questions about how it fits in with the FCA regulation.  Now, we're a division of 100 people.  I think the--the biggest of any regulator focusing solely on innovation.  So, that just shows the importance that we're putting on it from a--from the executive all the way down, and I--I joined the division a couple of years ago.  And I--I specifically came to develop a policy team within that function because I think the policy teams can be very removed from the innovation labs that a lot of regulators have. </p><p>But actually having that--that cross-harmonization and having, you know, members of my team working with sandbox firms, working with direct support firms to see what's going on, and then feeding that back into the policy process, I think has been incredibly valuable. </p><p>DEWAAL: As an old-timer on this panel, having worked with the AFBD and then the FSA and now the FCA, it's actually interesting to see the migration of your regulatory structure versus what's a relatively 1930s regulatory structure here in the United States.  But Tom, let me go back to you.  So, the last panel was stable coins.  You've just told us that oracles really are somewhat inconsistent with decentralization. </p><p>Is the idea of having a decentralized blockchain just a pipe dream?  Is it--is it really not going to happen?  Are we going in the wrong direction? </p><p>BERTANI: I guess the decentralized aspect of blockchain is something that can be achieved for, you know, a very small set of applications.  So, if you--if we look for, you know, fully decentralized applications in the blockchain, cryptocurrency are really the only use case I see today that doesn't need any external intervention to the blockchain, and this--this doesn't come as a surprise, given that it is the--the blockchain was first, you know, designed to make, you know, Bitcoin work. </p><p>So, any complex application, including stable coins or, you know, including like smartcontracts that may replicate functionalities for, you know, insurance products or financial instruments or things like that, they typically need external inputs from--from, you know, exchanges, or from, you know, (INAUDIBLE) or the internet, I would say. </p><p>So given that, it's really unlikely in my opinion that we'll see many fully decentralized applications coming to life in the--in the short-term.  There--there--we have seen some systems, which are typically quite complex and based on like game theory and some incentive mechanisms that try not to rely too much on, you know, external players or authorities, but I would argue that in most cases, there is--sometimes, it's quite hidden. </p><p>But there is like somewhere a small piece that needs to trust someone.  So, it's not fully like trust system differently than, you know, cryptocurrency systems.  So, oracles somehow compromise, if you want, the--the decentralization of those metrics, but the reality is that the problem is not the oracle itself, which could be sort of trustless.  The problem is the data that we need.  So, the oracle is just, you know, basically moving data around. </p><p>So at the end of the day, the problem is that the external data is someone--is something provided by a trusted player.  So if there is a trusted player involved, I wouldn't find, you know, a trustless system in the first place. </p><p>DEWAAL: Tim, Patrick, do you guys have any views on this?  Is decentralization really then just a pipe dream, other than for virtual currencies? </p><p>MURCK: So I mean, again, I think I agree mostly with Thomas there.  I think what's interesting is when you see the idea of like using prediction markets or something like that as an oracle, which I think you were referring to, and some other systems for that, it does become sort of a turtle's problem, right.  Like at some point, it's just every time you do a prediction market for one thing, then you have to rely on how that prediction market has resolved. </p><p>And then, a lot of the complex schemes, it's like you're really just laying another prediction market on top of a prediction market on top--it's like turtles, turtles, turtles, turtles, right, like all the way, and eventually, you're just like trusting that somebody is going to actually give you proper data.  The other interesting like component here is, and why it gets challenging even if you could come up with some complex game theory to allow you to do more sophisticated things than, say, Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency in general. </p><p>When you start introducing into those transactions that are being validated other sorts of data and especially other things of value, you can distort the economics of the game theory that the validators are relying on to form consensus on valid data, something that was addressed ages ago in a paper out of Princeton.  They called it a Goldfinger attack, after the James Bond film, right.  The idea is that you can--you can add--if you, say, take a Bitcoin transaction and you attach it to, say, like the deed on your house, which is kind of silly, but say it was like actually like a bearer instrument deed on somebody's house. </p><p>And the house's transaction value is 10 cents, but the house is worth a million dollars or something.  I mean, we're in D.C., so it's probably even more, but then when the miners go to mine that block, the value at stake for them, when they sacrifice that--they make that sacrifice, so the proof of work, the computational resources, it's not for 10 cents anymore.  It's for a million dollars and 10 cents on that transaction, right, and it completely distorts their economic incentive to be truthful in terms of what data they post and whether or not they're willing to break the system or collude or do other things. </p><p>So, just adding this external data becomes a governance challenge in how these networks are administering it and kind of keeps a cap on the complexity of what you can do on the systems overall.  And there are some ways to get around that with encryption and other things and snarks and whatever, but it's tricky. </p><p>DEWAAL: Okay. </p><p>REDEL: So, I'll bring it to an area that's not so technical, which is the smart contracts.  So, everybody's talking about smart contracts.  Let's leave aside the fact that they're relatively new and just getting tested, but what we don't know is how when there is some coding issue or something that goes wrong in the smart contracts, how we do create this speed bump, how do we create the speed bump that's in the law as it currently is, whether it's in bankruptcy law or in other types of financial applications that gives the time-out, whether it's the oracle, the validator, or some trusted person to say, there's a problem here. </p><p>And the example that is not a crypto example that was well-written about by Matt Levine, who I highly recommend to everybody, was there was a muni bond sold in the way muni bonds are normally done, but when the law associated went to do all of the work, he miswrote the code, and therefore later on when arbs got a hold of it, it wasn't convertible into $350 million.  It was convertible into $5 billion.  So, what did they do? </p><p>They sued, and the judge made a decision.  So, in these smart contracts, if they're self-executing, we still need some way in which you have the time-out to be able to say there was some current problem in the code. </p><p>DEWAAL: So--So Tim, I know you and I have chatted about this.  When EOS was rolled out last June, there was like an immediate problem where there was a bunch of accounts that was suspected to have illicit funds.  The constitution basically--the EOS constitution basically said there should be an arbitration on that before anything is frozen.  That's not what the 21 validators did.  They sort of took it into their own hands. </p><p>Discuss the incidence a little bit more, and give your views on how--how again the governance, the constitution, interfaces with validation.  And maybe, we can talk a little bit about the legal consequences of all that. </p><p>SWANSON: Sure, yeah.  Good example.  So, EOS.  So, any deep big bag EOS holders here?  No one wants to admit it.  One guy out there.  So yeah, there's 21 block producers.  They're called VPs, effectively the same thing as miners.  They got on a phone call, a conference call, like two weeks after the network had launched, and then, they agreed to pause the network to where they would not produce any more blocks. </p><p>And they did that for a number of hours, and then, they restarted it.  So--and this goes back to something that I've talked to Patrick for a couple of years now related to FinCEN allowing miners to be--given a loophole around the administrator registration requirement.  And this is not the only one.  So, my own view is, well hey, this was an obviously a brief moment, a few hours, but it was still a moment.  If regular FMIs have to register and have to comply--does anyone know what an FMI is, financial market infrastructure?  Raise your hand.  Actually, who's read the PFMIs, the principles--okay, so like two, three, four.  Okay, five people. </p><p>Let me take a step back.  There's two entities, CPMI and IOSCO.  In 2012, they put out a set of principles, and on pages 67, 68, 69 have to do with settlement and commercial bank money and central bank money and what these financial market infrastructures should be using and best practices.  Anyways, all that was thrown away from--or not even bothered to be looked at cryptocurrency folks. </p><p>And so, we could argue about whether or not EOS should be regulated as an FMI, maybe, if it becomes big enough, the FSB or someone looks at it and says, hey, you guys are systemically important.  But one we haven't talked about that ties in with EOS is Libra.  We haven't mentioned it at all on this stage, so let me throw this out here quick.  Any big Facebook shareholders in here?  No.  All right, you guys are all at the other testimony, right, across the city. </p><p>So, Libra, one of the aspirational goals that they laid out in their white paper is saying, hey, we're going to start with permission, but then somehow five years from now, we're going to become permissionless.  It's really--if you talk to someone like Tony at the last panel, obviously he represents the evil wizard men of the banks, which, you know, make our world operate.  If you look at the custody model that Libra initially wants or at least talked about up until I guess today. </p><p>I don't know what's happening over there in the testimony, but they said, hey, we'll allow forks.  Forks will happen, and it'll be okay.  But really, it's not because if you have $10 billion sitting in a city custody account, they're not going to split off and create another custody account for that fork and those other forks and so forth.  They're legally not allowed to do that, at least in the current structure.  I'm not a lawyer.  Feel free to tell me how wrong I am, but it ties back into the EOS thing about validators and recourse around any type of fork. </p><p>That hasn't been resolved, and apparently, there's not enough money at stake for people to sue each other over it. </p><p>REDEL: Just take the EOS thing.  If you put all the people in a room and they make a decision, and they're the shareholders or the governance, that's problematic.  It's problematic for a lot of reasons.  If they were all the CEOs of pharma companies, we'd call that-- </p><p>SWANSON: --Antitrust. </p><p>REDEL: Antitrust.  We'd call that antitrust, and so when you have--go back to governance.  I mean, the governance is critical, and if you can influence it by putting all the people in a room and if there's enough money at stake, and here there was enough money at stake and the same thing with the Dow, people can say, let's go back in time and rewrite the block chain on that one or two blocks, and then, we can go forward from there because the concentration of who owns all these various currencies that are at the heart of each one of these projects is still very, very centralized. </p><p>And so, when you add centralized governance or inadequate governance with centralization of ownership, you end up with people sitting in a room and making decisions that benefit themselves and not the holders necessarily of-- </p><p>SWANSON: --So, it's very decentralized. </p><p>REDEL: Yeah. </p><p>SWANSON: No, the issue of the--the issue of the governance--the distinction between governance and the model and the agreement, the constitution, and validation is very, very interesting.  It sort of slipped under the radar screen last year.  The SEC actually brought and settled an action against the founder of Ether Delta.  Ether Delta was a--I think most people are familiar with Ether Delta.  Ether Delta is an exchange-type facility, and the SEC basically said it should've been registered as a national stock exchange. </p><p>But it was really a smart contract, and it recognized the fact that you just don't--it means nothing to sue a smart contract.  So, it basically said, we're going to look and find somebody responsible, and they did.  They found the original developer and programmer.  And I think that's ultimately potentially one of the issues.  My background is as a derivatives counsel.  CFTC has an incredibly powerful provision that was given to it under Dodd-Frank. </p><p>And they were able to go after anybody who transaction a commodity, let alone a futures contract, and interstate commerce.  If you engage in a deceptive device or a contrivance, they can go after you, and a court recently upheld the very, very broad power of that.  I can imagine a circumstance where the CFTC gets enough complaints about something, and they do have theoretical jurisdiction over commodities.  Virtual currencies have been determined to a commodity, and they could create issues. </p><p>But I'm curious whether this issue has come up in the UK yet.  Have you thought about concentration?  Have you thought about anti-trust in connection with, you know, virtual assets? </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Yeah, I mean, absolutely.  I think there is a big risk there, and I think we're starting to talk a little bit around some of the Libra issues right now.  I think some of the offerings coming to the market don't give enough consideration to that, and I think that's something that needs to be thought about upfront.  And I guess I can understand that to a certain extent, but I would say that you need to come to the regulator and start to have those conversations as early as possible because then we can--we know how to respond that, and I think there can be a gap there sometimes. </p><p>MURCK: And I think the Libra issue, though, isn't necessarily a governance issue.  With all due-- you know, credit to our host, Chris, right, Libra doesn't have 99 problems.  It has one problem, right, and that one problem is that they established a separate unit of account called Libras.  If they got rid of that and they just moved to national currencies, they become a payments network--permission payments network. </p><p>They already have the money transmitter license in many states in the US.  I'm sure they can obtain them elsewhere, and then, it's just question of, do we think big tech should operate a payments company, right, like Alipay or WePay or any of those other competitors that are out there. </p><p>DEWAAL: I was going to say, we've already crossed that hurdle in different countries, so-- </p><p>MURCK: --But the key here is, like with Libra's model, they didn't take a half measure in governance.  They said that they were a private permission blockchain with known validators who will be registered and get license and do all those things.  With, you know, the EOSs and other delegated proof of stake systems, there's 21 validators.  That and the constitution and all of that, it's like a half measure, right, between a fully permissionless system and a permission system. </p><p>What I think actually gets lost in Block.One and EOS and all that discussion is, it's actually kind of clever, right, because those 21 validators are not fixed.  They are being elected by everybody who uses the network, so you can either stake your points to garner resources on the network or to vote for somebody to represent your interest on validating.  Now, I'm not saying they did it the right way or that conference call governance is the appropriate way to manage blockchains, certainly not, although Ethereum makes a lot of hay out of the fact they had this conference call, and then a month later, I think they had a conference call. </p><p>So, you know, let's be fair.  I think this kind of thing happens a lot, but I think that's clever, right.  It's saying like if you're going to build a network you should also own the network.  If you're going to participate in the network, you should also own the network, whereas Libra is very traditional, and they're saying, no, if you want to use Libra, you're not going to own anything.  But you can transact and pay people with it. </p><p>If they get rid of that unit of account issue, it becomes a much easier question for them. </p><p>REDEL: But you make it sound so democratic that if you're going to own part of the network, you're going to vote part of the network, but the ability to concentrate that voting is the issue. </p><p>MURCK: I agree 100 percent. </p><p>REDEL: If you can get enough of the 21 seats, then you own the ability to do what you want.  So, whatever 51 percent, it's pretty simple to get of 21, and the amount of money in order to be able to have each one of those oracle validators wasn't so much.  So, you could see easily the takeover one of those kind-- </p><p>MURCK: --100 percent agree, and as I said, a half measure, right, and so, it has all the challenges of a half measure.  But it also goes back to how their ICO was handled, right, when they did 360-day-- </p><p>SWANSON: --Didn't you help out with co-counsel on the-- </p><p>MURCK: --I helped defend them.  That was great.  Let's just call him a Good Samaritan. </p><p>REDEL: That worked out pretty well. </p><p>MURCK: Yeah, but I did not help with the fundraise, and I was an outside counsel for that.  But it begets to what you're saying, and again, whether we agree whether it was effective or whether it was the answer, they were being thoughtful and intentional by saying, we want to spread this out in an auction over 360 days to make sure this gets as widely dispersed as possible.  And it becomes an issue and a governance issue when other people want to do these types of networks, and they want to do better. </p><p>They want to take the lessons and do better, but they can't get wide distribution of their proof of stake tokens into as many hands as possible because they're scared of violating U.S. securities laws and international securities laws because it's vague.  And it's uncertain how they can actually get tokens out into the world into as many hands as possible to make it just not an artifice of democratic governance but actual democratic governance. </p><p>BERTANI: I think it's quite interesting anyway to see the evolution of the governance of those networks because if we look at the example of (INAUDIBLE) on Ethereum, the governance that it had back then is very different from the one we see today.  And at the same time, the EOS example was just a few weeks after the inception of the network.  If we look back at Bitcoin in 2009, the actual validators on the network, like the miners, were like very few. </p><p>I would say probably less than 10 people, so we don't know if those people ever met or done cause to define, how to solve potential, you know, problems for the network, how to upgrade the network, how to change the rules.  We know for sure that after a new network is started, there are always like new problems to solve and new technical issues that need a quick intervention  from people who can choose, which at the beginning may be very easy to define, but after a few years of operation, if there is some kind of traction in the community, the governance may change significantly. </p><p>So if we look at Ethereum today, I would argue that the opinion of Ethereum Foundation, for instance, is still relevant but is probably not that easy for the Ethereum Foundation to like force anyone to agree on something potentially controversial, like it was done with (INAUDIBLE).  Same thing with EOS in a few years' time probably.  Why with Bitcoin what we see today is that it's pretty much impossible to upgrade the network because the governance is like pretty much--I would say there is no governance. </p><p>Like it's like complicated for anyone to push through-- </p><p>SWANSON: --Well there's a governance.  It's on Twitter.  It's whoever gets the most retweets. </p><p>REDEL: But you would also have to admit that on Bitcoin you have a very high concentration of where the validators are.  The miners, 81 percent of them coming from machines in China. </p><p>BERTANI: That's correct, but it's also correct to say that miners don't--have no ability to change the rules.  So, the only thing they could do is basically transfer the network and prevent transactions from being confirmed, but they are not capable of changing the rules in any way.  So--and it's not sufficient for miners to upgrade if the key players in the market, like the exchanges, the users, and so on, decide they want to stay on the previous--with the previous ruleset. </p><p>REDEL: Well, that's true. </p><p>DEWAAL: Listen, in literature as in life and blockchain as in politics, centralization makes things easier to get done, and it's always a tradeoff between democratization and centralization.  What's interesting is it likely has some regulatory consequences too, where you fall out on the situation.  We've got some time to take some questions from the audience, so what's out there?  And then, be prepared to run in the back because I see gentleman in the back. </p><p>QUESTION: Brett McDowell with the Hedera Hashgraph Governing Council, and my question is for people on the panel.  Are you bullish or bearish with the governance model that we've used, that Libra associations used, of a loosely coupled but legally defined trade association providing the bureaucratic governance over these networks?  So, bullish on that approach, bearish on that, and why? </p><p>REDEL: I would bring a slightly different topic up on your network, which is your token economics.  So, I don't think you can just look at these things in isolation, as to governance, network, etc.  You have to look in the totality because you might have one governance, but in your instance, you let--there's so many tokens came out when the SAFT was over that it depressed the price so much, and now, you're rethinking that issue. </p><p>So, there all very intertwined and related, so I'm not bullish or bearish on any single one thing.  I think we learn as we go along in these interrelated and interconnected aspects of any network. </p><p>SWANSON: I'd say bearish-to-neutral.  Sorry, I interrupted you. </p><p>NAVARATNAM: Oh, I was going to say, I completely agree with that, and from a regulatory perspective, it's not our role to be bullish or bearish, but I definitely see, you know, these governance pieces are intertwined.  And I think, you know, you really need to focus on--I mean, certainly the U.K. context, it might be different in a U.S.  context, but the complexities that are associated with some of these governance decisions and small changes in the rights, for example, that afforded to different tokens can have quite a different impact from a regulatory perspective and how you are regulated. </p><p>So, I know that we've spoken about governance as not being the issue, but I think in a UK context for things like Libra, we can't take it off the table yet. </p><p>SWANSON: Yeah, the reason I'm saying is bearish-to-neutral, I previously worked at a company called R3, and they put together a consortia back in 2015, so about four years ago.  And they saw by the time the series A was completed for the funding of what became Corda, they lost about 15 percent, 20 percent of the participants.  It's not quite as much, but Libra lost 25 percent within two months or so.  So, it's a little bit different. </p><p>Obviously, it's not quite the same process that you guys have either because there's no token involved with what Corda was doing, but then, the USC model, which is this other consortia that was spun up, they haven't launched yet.  But the actual shareholders of this thing that may become an FMI, so it would be good to ask that question again maybe in six to 12 months. </p><p>DEWAAL: I saw a question in the back. </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, looking back at your discussion on proof of stake versus proof of work, I'm curious about the byproducts of the proof of work model, especially in the form of heat and some of the discussions that have come out on the use of that heat byproduct for complementary economic activities, such as farming or heating buildings, and whether that will factor in to the ultimate decision to switch or to decide between these two models. </p><p>MURCK: I remember back in like--Thomas and I are like old-school Bitcoiners, right.  So, we were like reminiscing.  I remember back in the day people would talk about like Bitcoin toasters, right.  Mine some Bitcoin, make some toast, you know.  Yeah, I mean, again, the way proof of work works is that you have to prove your work.  You have to sacrifice a resource.  It's sort of essential.  I wonder if it--you always want to optimize your CapEx.  Taping out chips, designing, fabricating, all that, and then your OpEx for the 12 to 16 months or whatever those chips area in production.   </p><p>I wonder if it wouldn't be like distortive again on the governance, right, in terms of like what you're sacrificing to validating the thing if you're also using the same resource to generate revenue in another way.  That's like an interesting academic question that I haven't really unpacked yet, but I think it's an interesting one. </p><p>SWANSON: So, we could actually look at--I just wrote a post about this like two weeks ago.  If we look more at Bitcoin and Ethereum right now as the largest proof of work networks, if we look at Litecoin, if you take the network hash rate and divide it by the common hardware unit that would so some mining, in a given year, it consumes about the electrical footprint of a country like Moldova.  Yet if you look at the actual economic activity on a platform like Litecoin, it's almost nil aside from payments to the miners themselves as coin-based reward. </p><p>And there's only like actual full-time developer, Charlie Lee, who actually created it.  So, if we take away these edge outliers like Bitcoin and Ethereum that may or may not--or at least in Ethereum case, they are going to be switching over to proof of stake.  Litecoin provides no socially useful function and is--even things like natural gas.  Nobody uses this network that's again consuming up the European energy footprint. </p><p>REDEL: But there are--there are a number of startups that have been funded that are using wind power.  I think one was just funded to the rate of $50 million, and there's a big project that was attempting to start in Morocco that all would be done on wind.  And so, it would be a combination of environmentally friendly as well as being able to power the networks. </p><p>MURCK: There's sort of these like stranded areas, right, where they have resources built out to generate like power in a responsible way, but there isn't an economic case to be made because there's not enough development around them.  And so, this might be a way to unlock some of those things.  I mean, let's see how it shakes out, but you know, that's the hopeful case, I think, in terms of like managing the kind of externalities around this proof of work mining. </p><p>I think it's interesting when you said that Ethereum is moving to proof of stake.  I don't think they think they're moving to proof of stake, right.  They're just creating a new Ethereum that's proof of stake. </p><p>SWANSON: Technically, you're right.  The Ethereum we call it today is actually the fork of Ethereum classic.  We could split hairs all day if you want. </p><p>MURCK: I don't think it's splitting hairs, though.  I think it's really interesting because they're actually going to have--I mean, last I heard, the idea with Ethereum is that you'll have both chains running simultaneously.  They're going to just keep the proof of work one because they can't convince the miners.  It's a governance question again.  They can't convince the miners to just like abandon what they're doing and stop because why would they?  They're making money doing it on GPU mining. </p><p>So, it's commodity mining, and they need to launch a proof of stake network to stay competitive in the market with everybody else that's coming out.  So, they're just going to rebrand it, but why should everybody else go along with the rebrand? </p><p>REDEL: Well maybe, they'll see how it works, and as it goes along, people switch from the current one that they're using to the other one, and it's a backup system.  You know, we do that a lot in financials. </p><p>MURCK: Who has the power of branding it at the exchange level and at different levels and in conversations like this to say that the proof of stake one is now Ethereum and the proof of work one is old Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, whatever. </p><p>SWANSON: Sure.  You're talking about Bitcoin simple administration basically, which is a good point, and you see that with the ETFs, right.  Like well we're going to recognize--if you look at the BRR, whatever the reference rate.  If there's a fork that happens, we're only going to recognize that with the most--the longest chain or whatever, but it's a valid point.  Obviously, they haven't convinced--nothing's actually happened.  It's all aspirational.  Maybe next year, we'll have something to argue about. </p><p>MURCK: I keep trying, man.  I keep trying. </p><p>SWANSON: One day. </p><p>DEWAAL: It's nice to see the dispute.  Some more questions.  Right up-- </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Petal Walker, WilmerHale.  Quick question about proof of stake.  Is there any concern that if you move to proof of stake model and that leads to greater concentration, that may push you into a security definition, particularly since the chairman of the CFTC recently said you can go from security to commodity, back to security if circumstances change? </p><p>REDEL: I will tell you, the person who knows the most about going from security to commodity and will remind us that there was a case at Eurex, right? </p><p>DEWAAL: That's right, Eurex Deutschland. </p><p>REDEL: Is right here as our moderator. </p><p>DEWAAL: The--I always--I have many stump speeches in this area, and one of my favorite stump speeches it that everybody in this area pays attention to the Dow 21(a) order or the SEC, but two 21(a) orders prior to that was one involving Eurex Deutschland, and the Eurex Deutschland was fascinating because the CFTC and the SEC sort of have an agreed and then now legislated approach to what's called security futures. </p><p>If it's a broad-based futures contract, it falls under the jurisdiction of the CFTC.  If it's a narrow-based--if it's a futures contract based on a narrow index, it's shared, which effectively means you default to SEC rules and at least according to this 21(a) order, and for those who don't know what a 21(a) order is, instead of bringing an enforcement action, the SEC basically says, tsk, tsk, tsk, shame on you.  Don't do it again. </p><p>And it's meant to be a notice in the industry.  Well in that case, Eurex had been happily operating under the jurisdiction of the CFTC broad-based, and then over time, because of the capitalization of one of the components of the index, they actually then began to fall as a futures on a narrow base.  And the SEC said, hey, you forgot that things change, things morph.  We've heard that.  Bill Hinman said the same thing about Ether. </p><p>And yes, I do think that, as the mechanics--I think Laura, you said it before.  Subtle changes in product can have severe regulatory consequences.  When the SEC gave the guidance on ICO's crypto securities, they talked about active participants, and if someone is deemed an active participant and the system becomes depended on active participants, it can have a consequence in the nature of how a product is viewed. </p><p>So you know, again, it's one of many things to think about, but I mean, I'm curious here what Laura has to say.  But I do think that, you know, if there's a concentration and now a system is being dependent on a fewer number of persons to effectively validate and confirm transactions, and if somehow they get involved in, you know, the promotion, I think it could have regulatory consequences. </p><p>MURCK: It's actually--it's the other way, right.  Like it takes it away from a small number of people and distributes it out to a lot of people. </p><p>DEWAAL: It could in theory.  You don't know how the outcome is. </p><p>MURCK: Well in a delegated proof of stake scenario, which they all are, that you're voting on it, but the trick is, from a securities law context, is that you're now receiving income from your participation, which you didn't before.  And that's a tricky thing.  I think that the SEC, and I want to get your thoughts too.  I'm sorry.  I kind of just intermediated as an oracle on this.  So, the tricky part is--and I think where the SEC's guidance gets hazy and where the SEC generally gets lost is that they focus on the token, right.  </p><p>Oranges aren't securities.  Tokens aren't securities.  That's not the security.  The overall scheme may mean that the token represents a ride in something that is a security.  That's the overall scheme of the network and the system and how you relate to it.  There's sort of like an implied contract there.  Not a smart contract because there's no such thing as smart contracts.  They're only dumb non-contracts, but there is an implied contract potentially.  And that implied contract may be an investment contract. </p><p>It may be a security, and when you switch from proof of work to proof of stake, depending on how that scheme is set up, if you're deriving income from the work of others on that network, then you know, you might have a problem there.  But that's the U.S. version.  The UK version-- </p><p>NAVARATNAM: --No, I think you're absolutely right, and we do get a bit distracted with the token and how we're labeling them, rather than thinking about what's actually underpinning that and what are the outcomes we're seeking to achieve.  And actually, some people think of all these different pieces as mutually exclusive, but they're not.  There's quite a lot of overlap, so don't assume that one chain will maybe move from one bucket into another. </p><p>Actually, you may still be falling into both, and different elements of that token, whether it be the fund that it's referencing the token itself, the relationship it's having with its--with the intermediaries or the end consumer.  All those different pieces can be falling into different regulatory buckets.  So, I think it's really--it's a really complex picture. </p><p>DEWAAL: And one of the morals of the 21(a) order that the SEC issued on, on Eurex Deutschland was there was a suggestion that just because it swung over to the securities 21(a), it doesn't mean it can go back, and it could be the exact same thing.  We know Ether was a security at the beginning or at least the offering--ether was likely a security, according to Bill Hinman.  Today, it's not, but yes, it could swing back. </p><p>REDEL: Yes, and I think that the point you brought up, which was in the framework of the associated-- </p><p>DEWAAL: --The active person-- </p><p>REDEL: --Active person, that was a new concept, and though the SEC went to active participants.  And the SEC went to great lengths on giving various examples of where it might be the work of others and applying to the Howey Test.  This whole category was new.  We don't really know how that will work in either governance or proof of stake or proof of work, as things develop.  So, it could be something into a security that was clearly not before because of the APs, active participation. </p><p>DEWAAL: So, I see the guy with the hook, so that means we're done.  I'd like to thank the panelists.  I'd like to thank the audience for being interactive, and enjoy the rest of the conference. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>NOLAN: Thank you, Gary and the panel.  That was a great discussion.  So right before everyone jumps to lunch, just be back here at 20 after 12 for our next panel on the new custody solutions.  You'll find--in terms of lunch, you'll find stations all around with food and some drinks in the back.  So, enjoy but be back here at 20 after 12.  Thank you. </p><p>Welcome back. Hope everybody's satiated and ready for the next round of panelists. Before we get back into the swing of things, I just want to remind you that we are keeping abreast of what's going on down Capitol Hill with Zuckerberg, and we are--are seek your roll call. Journalists are down there, and they are tweeting out, and letting us know what's going on, so we can get--let the panelists know what's going on and get their reactions. </p><p>So, let's jump right in. Our next panel, The New Custody Solutions, will be moderated by Brad Carr. Brad is the Senior Director of Digital Finance at the International Institute of Finance. Brad, I will turn it over to you. </p><p>CARR: Cheers. </p><p>NOLAN: Go for it. </p><p>CARR: Thank you very much. Thank you all for making it back after lunch. And--and of course, thank you to Roll Call and Georgetown Law for putting on this fantastic event. </p><p>The New Custody Solutions--we have a great lineup of very informed and diverse perspectives to discuss this topic. We have a couple of the leading providers of digital custody solutions both for individual and institutional investors. </p><p>From Gemini, we have Yusuf Hussain, the Head of Risk. </p><p>And from Trustology we have Alex Batlin, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer. </p><p>We have Yaya who worked as the Economic Analyst and Counterterrorism expert for the CIA, and has researched heavily on Bitcoin money laundering and facilitated public/private information sharing. </p><p>He then moved on to found CryptoCurrency AML Strategies and it's delightful to have his perspective. </p><p>And then, we have a couple of the leading regulatory agencies represented. We have Kavita who's the Director of Innovation at FINRA. FINRA of course, is a very progressive agency on a lot of digital topics. And you will have heard on Monday where they were very much cited rightly as a leader in the genre of cloud technology as one example. </p><p>And Lizzie is the Director of Trading and Markets at the SEC where she oversees the crypto initiatives among several other things. She was describing to me earlier, the breadth of the portfolio and the perspective that she's able to bring to us. </p><p>So, with such great expertise here on stage, my role is going to be merely that of time keeper. But to quickly set out the busy sequence of the conversation or trying to, we're going to firstly start with defining some of the topical issues. </p><p>We'll then look at some of the particular asset types, and classes, and the market conditions. And then, we'll move on to the regulatory component firstly, looking at regulatory uncertainty, regulators responses, and--and what I sometimes call the shared journey where we see industry and regulators often learning and working together. </p><p>We'll finalize that with--with a quick look at the role for self-regulatory organizations before we then open up to audience questions using the--the roaming mics around the room. </p><p>So, I want to start naturally by quoting Professor Chris Brummer, our host. Chris in a number of his tweets last week and also in the remarks he gave for the IF Annual Membership Meeting referred to last week to the trilemma of cost, and security, and scalability. And that you can get one, perhaps you can get two. But it's very difficult to get all three. </p><p>And he also spoke of the tradeoffs when you look at hot and cold storage depending on whether the emphasis, you're looking for perhaps is more about liquidity, or about liquidity needs, or about redemptions. So, if I can throughout--that out there as perhaps an opening scene sitter from our host, Chris. </p><p>And Alex, if I can start with you, any reaction on that--that trilemma or those tradeoff notions perhaps? </p><p>BATLIN: Yeah. I mean, it's an interesting one, but I think it's actually missing the point. The biggest one is whether you hold your own keys or let somebody else hold the keys for you because if you hold the keys yourself, then it's actually really fast. It depends how you secure it. </p><p>But it's--it's then up to you, the responsibility to keep those keys. We had a gentleman before talking about it being bear assets. I think just like misnomer. It's not really bare asset because proper bare asset is literally just a piece of paper. There's no other record. </p><p>On blockchain, the record is there. It's just if you lost the keys, you can no longer transfer the transactions. So, I--I take the point that it's kind of a bare asset, but it's a little bit different. And the gentleman's smiling right now. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Maybe not later. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But anyway, so--so I think whether or not you hold it is important and it depends on who else holds it for you. So, most of the solutions today to make it secure if a third-party holds it for you tend to be what's called cold storage. And the cold storage means basically at the very basic level, you print out a piece of paper, the password. You put it in the vault. </p><p>And then, if you want to sign any other transaction, then some guy walks there with the transaction, signs it on an offline computer, and submits it. It's kind of barbaric in my opinion and also, it's--it also kind of gives you false sense of hope that you're not going to be hacked. </p><p>Well, human becomes just the new interface that you hack, but very, very slow inexpensive one. So, I think, you know, ourselves and others in the marketplace are providing a very fast, very secure kind of key management in real-time--350 milliseconds to sign a transaction. </p><p>And we now are insured--one of the few in the world that are---for storage. So, I think we're starting to technologically tip over that. But actually, it's much more of an ideological question. </p><p>Now is it you who has the keys or a third party? And I think that's the bigger question. We've now solved the problem of speed if you're willing to take custodian route. </p><p>CARR: You touch on insurance there and that's a point that we might come back to a little later. But use of--I'd like to invite you to build on that and perhaps if you could highlight the most fundamental differences between digital custody and fiat custody, for instance. </p><p>HUSSAIN: Yeah, absolutely. The fiat custody is fundamentally different from digital asset custody as--as--as is mentioned, right? </p><p>It's--it's heavily seeded in--in security key management cryptography. This industry is the--probably the first industry in the world if you don't appropriately manage those keys, if you don't have appropriate key management cryptography in place, loss of data results in loss of dollars, right? </p><p>So, if a--a custodian doesn't get cryptography key management correct, it's--it's--it's--it's core to the business and. You--you know, there's multiple layers of controls with an institutional grade custodial solution. </p><p>As different flavors as mentioned, you can hold the keys or you can have a trusted third party hold those keys. There's different models. There's different maturities of which a custodian--centralized custodial solutions are provided. </p><p>But when--when--when you look at an institutional grade custodial solution, there's--there's a couple of things that you need to look out for. And I know insurance was mentioned. There's--in terms of key management, you've got multiple layers of controls to even get access to the funds in--in--in order to even get access to the--the controlled location if you will. </p><p>These keys need to be safeguarded in the same manner that you safeguard any secrets. So, you don't want to hold them in a little--a USB device. You need to give some consideration to availability and redundancy. </p><p>And a custodial solution like Gemini, for example you want to make sure that the--the--the third-party custodian is appropriately licensed and--and--and registered under a--a--the appropriate regulatory regime. </p><p>This way, what you get is some--some additional comfort that there are capital reserve requirements. There are regular examinations of your solution. And on top of that, you know, we--we--we can talk about a little later independent validation of your security infrastructure, your architecture. </p><p>It's one thing to say that you're secure and you're securing people's phones. And then, it's another thing to demonstrate that you're secure using an independent third-party to validate that. </p><p>BATLIN: Can I just interject on that one-- </p><p>CARR: Please. </p><p>BATLIN: --because I think it's interesting about capital reserves. It depends on the custodial model--model you take-- </p><p>CARR: Right. </p><p>BATLIN: ---because if you take a depository model which typically cold storage providers do because they have a way to comingle funds. Therefore, technically it's now deposited. </p><p>You can take a different view which is we manage the keys and you don't comingle funds in which case--in which case makes you much more of an account operator. And therefore, the cost of external audit drops significantly because you can just look at the blockchain and see what's happening. </p><p>You don't need to do that. So, I think we're seeing audit innovation in blockchain and to do with custody because you can get that kind of capability that you couldn't do with private ledgers. </p><p>HUSSAIN: That's right. There's been a lot of audit innovation in both spaces for both models. </p><p>CARR: Kavita, if I could bring in a regulator perspective here, why is custody such an important issue from a regular perspective? </p><p>JAIN: Sure. So, blockchain technology and the assets that I either represented or issued on a blockchain base network really create a completely new paradigm. It's really just turned things upside down. </p><p>I think the important thing here that people oftentimes forget is that custody in this context is really around--the discussions are around custody of keys. And the key is not necessarily the asset. The key provides access to the asset. </p><p>So, a lot of the risks that Alex and Yusuf mentioned, there are concerns around obviously theft and fraud. But to the extent that, you know, multi-sync technologies used, who are the various individuals/institutions that have access to those keys? And does that make them all custodians have the keys or even just stepping away from key management and focusing on the network itself, right? Who's operating the network? Is it a private or a public network? Do--can certain individuals gain control of the network? </p><p>All of that can impact the asset and therefore are important questions when we think about custody. And I think ultimately, for regulators, the focus here really is around the safety of customer assets and making sure that in the event of theft, or fraud, or even the, you know, in the case of securities--broker dealers--in the event a broker dealer goes under, that the customer's assets are safeguarded and they will get those assets in the event of a broker dealer liquidating. </p><p>BATLIN: There's one thing a lot of people don't mention and I think it's really interesting. We've--we have digital money controlled by banks. We've actually lost the ability to have anonymous transactions. And only we can do that with paper. </p><p>What I think can be really exciting with custody on blockchain is now you have a choice, yeah? Because essentially, what do we do? </p><p>We proxy transactions. So, what we can do is decide if it's below Sonoma Valley, you don't need to do KYC like a cash transaction. In U.K. it's about 50 pounds limit for transaction. </p><p>But now we're giving back the convenience of digital, but also the advantages of pseudonymous. We accept as a society. We want to do anonymous or anonymous transactions. </p><p>At the same time, a custodian can now start to provide the KYC layer to the higher value transactions. So, I think there's an important role there as well. </p><p>CARR: So, I wanted to turn to--to Yusuf next and noting the strength of his background in the AML space. I'll probably peak a little as to the--the question as to whether the anonymity that you describe there is necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. And there's probably some differing views depending on where you stand. </p><p>Yusuf invited--Yaya invited any reaction to that. But also, you know, interested in your views around the key issues for the scenarios of--of self-custody-- </p><p>FANUSIE: Yeah. </p><p>CARR: --and non-custodial wallets. </p><p>FANUSIE: Yeah. That's a good segue because I think I would go back to an early--earlier panel where I think Ms. Tanya McLaughlin asked, you know, \"Well, should we question the assumptions?\", you know. So, it is, \"Should we assume that we want anonymous payments?\" and that is a whole other ball of wax. </p><p>Maybe we'll come back to it. </p><p>CARR: Yeah. </p><p>FANUSIE: But maybe I can interject because yeah, I do look at these things mostly through the lens of the anti-money laundering and the counterterrorist financing. But you mentioned the issue of custody and self-self-custody, right? How is that different? </p><p>And I would say there are a couple of things to think about the sort of risks that come from folks when they want to just, you know, hold their private keys themselves and--and--and have their assets--have these digital assets in a self-custodied manner. </p><p>One is just--actually two things. The first is this is probably always going to be a niche community, right? Because today, you know, how many of us have $10,000, you know, in our mattress at home or any thousands of dollars in our mattress at home, right? </p><p>Convenience is probably always going to win out for most of the population and particularly in times of stability when you're not in a crisis, you know. Unless you're a--a--a--a--someone who for some reason doesn't trust the system, doesn't trust the government for some reason or, you know, if you were a chemistry teacher who has a side job now-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--where you have some unaccounted-for income, do you want to keep those assets separate and under your own control? </p><p>So, typically this is going to be a niche community. But there's, you know, there's a lot of risk, a lot of inconvenience. Convenience usually wins out. </p><p>But the other thing which I don't think folks are thinking enough about--and I see this again, from an AML perspective--I think that self-custodied wallets, unposted wallets, non-custodial wallets from the standpoint of transacting, I think moving forward, we're going to see those types of--that type of custody being seen as more risky. Risky from an institutional perspective, from an anti-money laundering perspective and we can maybe get into that into how regulators are starting to see these wallets. </p><p>And maybe they start classifying these self-custody--if they're non-KY speed wallets--as being riskier to transact with. And that might impact institutions. </p><p>CARR: So, I think that opens out a number of the issues that are topical and that we can explore a little further perhaps as we pivot in the conversation to specific asset types and asset classes. </p><p>And I'd like to start with you Lizzie, can you give us a sense of--of which asset types fall within the scope of--of which particular regulators such as yourself at the SEC? </p><p>BAIRD: First, let me say that the views I express here today are just my own. They are not the views of the Commission or any commissioners. </p><p>So, obviously we regulate securities. And so, what's a security in this particular world? </p><p>Well, lots of times, a particular asset will come to market and it will introduce itself as a security. So, that's easy. That's a security. </p><p>Other times, we have to do a fact-based analysis and we look at how it presents itself. So, our--our--the management team that's seeking to raise capital let's say talking about you're going to have ownership of whatever their company is--that tends to suggest it's a security or they suggest that you're going to make money if you hold on to this asset. That suggests it's a security. What are the expectations of the people buying this token? Do they think they're going to make money if they hold onto it? </p><p>That send--tends to suggest that it's a security. We look at all that and--and then, we think about the protections that are afforded under the Securities Act of 1933 and--and did those protections come into play here? </p><p>So, for example, the founders of blockchain--I mean, excuse me, of Bitcoin, whoever they may be. Before you consider buying a Bitcoin, is there anything that the people who created Bitcoin could tell you today that would help inform your decision? There really isn't, right? </p><p>So, is there anything that--that they're making disclosures would help you decide if you should buy or sell your Bitcoin. There really isn't, so they don't need the protections of a Securities Act. So, they probably aren't a security. </p><p>By contrast, somebody comes to market and it talks about the ongoing role of management in whatever this token is. And--and we feel that there's an asymmetry of information between the possible purchaser of the token and the people managing this company that the token represents. </p><p>And we feel that the way that that asymmetry can be normalized is if under the Securities Act, these people make periodic disclosures to the public including all the investors. So, that's how we decide. In part, we dad up all of the facts if something is a security or not a security. </p><p>CARR: Kavita, if I could get you to answer that and particular from the perspective of looking at broker dealers. What--I guess what are the--the types of digital asset securities that you're seeing broker dealers more typically being involved with? </p><p>JAIN: Yeah. So, first of all, financial jurisdiction comes into play when the broker dealer is engaged in securities or securities-based digital assets. And we're starting to see broker dealers get involved in this space just slowly and steadily. </p><p>The biggest area that broker dealers are starting to express interest and engage in is to facilitate the issuance of securities-based token of things, or these are private, unregistered securities, or private offerings that involve securities tokens. And they're typically sold pursuant to Reg D generally. </p><p>Then we're also seeing broker dealers that are facilitating the placement of funds that invest in crypto currencies. So, the funds are again, unregistered funds that in turn invest in crypto currencies. But these are private offerings. </p><p>I imagine that once the securities sort of restrictions are lifted and are available for secondary trading that brokers are going to start looking at potentially facilitating the secondary trading of these assets. </p><p>There's also been one example of a registered digital security where there's been broker dealer involvement. </p><p>And then, more recently, the box exchange or the STX--the Boston Securities Token Exchange--has filed an application or proposal with the SEC to--to create a--an exchange for secondary trading of--of digital tokens. </p><p>And so, I imagine if that goes through, then broker dealers will be involved in facilitating those transactions as well. </p><p>CARR: Alex, obviously this has been pretty dramatic proliferations of the types of assets that are around. You previously led emerging businesses in YML and probably one of the--the biggest--possibly the biggest traditional custodian service in the world. How do you find--in the digital environment, how do you find the custodial challenge of keeping pace with the--the proliferation of asset classes and--and specific asset types? </p><p>BATLIN: Yeah. It's--it's a great question kind of, but we did prepare it. So, I'm not surprised. </p><p>But yeah, look. One of the really exciting things for me anyway, about blockchain is what I call the kind of the long tail of trust. This is a new potentially asset class of self-servicing has slightly different rules. Obviously, we don't have regulation, but you can put a lot of information still in financial products--how you service it, etc., etc. </p><p>So--and I'm bringing the costs down hopefully over long-term, so you can have niche kind of cheap solutions to serve and improve trade. So, I think that's really exciting. </p><p>But that means, of course you're now going to have a proliferation of different asset classes. If you're a computer scientist, it just looks like you now have smart contracts with a lot more different method calls. And each method call you now as a custodian have to potentially support. </p><p>And therefore, you then have to create a huge number of user interfaces to support potentially hundreds of different asset classes. It's virtually impossible to do that. It just doesn't scale. </p><p>So, the realization we came to was that we had to build resigning technology. So, what we do is we effectively say, \"Look, the developers of the asset class develop asset classes. It's not our problem\", you know. We unbundle it. </p><p>They define the rules through smart contracts which also keeps the data layer. They also potentially arrive the user interface which often looks like a webpage. It is a webpage that talks to it. </p><p>And then, what we do is we re-sign. But then you need to go back to controls. What's the role of the custodian? It's control to some extent. </p><p>So, what we do then is we allow you to intercept any one transaction, inspect the transaction and apply controls at that point whether it's multi-sig, whether it's a KYT transaction, SAR reports, whatever it is or indeed just, you know, kind of white list/black list to the venues. </p><p>So, it's interesting kind of I went from the journey of having a small number of asset classes which are hard to service to millions of asset classes. And then, we had to wrap our head around the fact that we're not a traditional custodian. We're resigning transactions and we--we're effectively putting controls around the transaction, not the asset class. </p><p>Once you do that, you now have a scalable solution. But you have to wrap your mind around what is it that you're doing in this new context and you can't apply the old rules verbatim in any world which I kind of often see people try to ram in old--old controls into new space and just doesn't work. You have to kind of shift your mentality. </p><p>CARR: I want to ask an open question across the panel to whoever feels so inclined on one of the most notable market developments that's come to--to light in the last week or so. </p><p>There was a lot of news coverage in the FT, and on Coin Desk last week, and over the weekend about Fidelity and--and would their CEO ever go? Johnson announcing that they'll be moving beyond the experiments that she described as \"just for fun\" initially in this space. And increasingly, industrializing the offering that they bring to the market. </p><p>I'm interested in any thoughts firstly as to whether that move by Fidelity is perhaps a sign of the market maturing perhaps, but also perhaps what that might mean for what Fidelity's expansion might mean for the market in the future. Anyone want to take that? </p><p>HUSSAIN: From--from--from my standpoint, it provides further validation that this is an industry that is further maturing. We've got regulators paying attention to the space. We've got large multi-national companies paying attention to the space. And, you know, traditional financial industry players recognizing that there--there is--there is a significant potential within--within blockchain and crypto. </p><p>I--I--I think it--it--it makes sense for traditional financial institutions that have been--been, you know, the traditional financial industry is--is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world. Understanding the regulations and applying them in this new space as Alex mentioned, you can't jam old rules and regulations into this new world. But you know what? </p><p>There's folks that are familiar with--with the old regulations, understand its intent and--and how to implement it in a sensible manner within the--the--the crypto industry if you will. </p><p>CARR: So, that's a great point, Yusuf. I'm going to come back to you as we pivot into regulation in just a moment. </p><p>One other question that I wanted to pose possibly to Alex, but across the panel. Alex, you raised the point about insurance earlier in your--your opening comment. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit further there as to the role of insurance within this market or the differentiations across the--the--the different methods of--of custody and how that has impacts for insurance scenarios perhaps. </p><p>First Alex, if you'd like to comment and then if anyone on the panel would like to react? </p><p>BATLIN: Yeah, sure. I mean, look insurance is just a substitute for balance sheet. Let's--let's put it that way kind of. It also gives you an external kind of validation and trust for insurance ultimately. </p><p>But, you know, if you talk to most people--and this is where somebody like Fidelity has an advantage of a startup like me. They've got to load their balance sheet. Insurance kind of sometimes pays, sometimes doesn't. And therefore, people have very different views on this one. </p><p>And of course, the quality of insurance pay has really bumped because if you look at the exclusion list, some insurance policies you'll be told by various custodians they can. And they'll show one billion, whatever it is. But the reason they can show one billion is because the policy base will never pay out. </p><p>So, you need to really look at the quality of the people and whether you're actually likely to get anything. And then, you also need to divide the, you know, cold storage which actually initially insurers were able to get their head around it because they applied gold vaulting kind of insurance. I'm still not quite convinced it was the right model, but at least they knew how to price that. </p><p>We're now seeing the emergence of like us and others who are hot storage. And it took me about a year to work through with them and the underwriters to explain how we do why we do and why we're actually safe after being assured at reasonable rates. So, we'll see. I think we'll see innovation there. </p><p>And actually, jumping forward still, there is a really cool startup called Nexim--Nexus Mutual. They're now doing insurance on each smart contract transaction, yeah? </p><p>And that's pretty clever actually. I never thought of it before. So, what you're basically saying is what if the smart contract that you're interacting with has got a bug? </p><p>Bugs happen. So, what you can do now is get insurance on each transaction as you transact. So, I thought it was pretty clever. So, I know I stole the-- </p><p>HUSSAIN: No, to add on to--to Alex's point, taking--taking a step back there is no, you know, the crypto industry is maturing. We're looking to offer the same levels of consumer protection mechanisms that investors are used to in the traditional financial system. </p><p>And there is no FDIC insurance. There is no specific insurance in our space. So, the industry has had to get creative and work within traditional insurance markets, pay a pretty sum to get a significant amount of coverage. </p><p>And--and to--to what Alex mentioned, insurers were--were willing to underwrite cold storage. So--so as investors,  you want to ask, you know, \"What does your insurance policy cover\", right? Does it cover the--the less risky offline connected--offline cold storage or does it insure the online connected internet accessible hot wallet, right? </p><p>I think the industry has made some significant moves in--in--in getting appropriate levels of coverage. But these are sorts of questions that investors and regulators should be asking. \"What--what is the insurance? What are the exclusions and what are the inclusions?  And what does it cover?\" </p><p>CARR: So, let's now turn to regulatory uncertainty. And I want to hear from our regulators and also from the IR in terms of some of the federal standards in the money laundering space. </p><p>But perhaps just to firstly tea that up, if we take the--the point you were starting to elude a moment ago about the--I guess the application of analog regulation in--in the digital world. Could I ask you just to start by sitting out some of the specific areas of regulatory uncertainty that you find to be the--the most problematic of those that are perhaps inhibiting market development? </p><p>HUSSAIN: Sure. So, in terms of regulatory uncertainty, you've got the--the current federal regulators and state regulators trying to figure out how to apply the existing rules and regulations to--to crypto. It's similar, but it's different, you know. </p><p>What's interesting is the CFTC had indicated in 2018 that the crypto industry--industry needs to self-regulate. Basically, regulation needs to move at the pace of innovation. </p><p>In--in the summer of 2018, the SEC had delayed their decisions on ETFs citing a couple of things--a couple of concerns from their standpoint including the lack of market surveillance. And around the--around September of 2018, the industry had gotten together. A couple of players in the industry had gotten together and acknowledged that we need to respond to the SFDC, the SEC's and other state regulators calls to action on--on self-regulating within the crypto space. </p><p>So, we had established what we call the Virtual Commodity Association. I want to be very clear that we're not an SRO yet. It is a very specific definition as to what it means to be an SRO. And just for clarity, what that ultimately distills is regulations at the executive level that require an SRO to have simply put, it's--it's--it's--it's not this simple, but cross-market surveillance across the crypto industry. And also, enforcement/examination capabilities. </p><p>And with that in mind, the--the Virtual Commodity Association had--had pulled together a number of ex-regulators across the SEC, the New York State Department of Financial Services who had been instrumental in creating the bit license, the early days and--and pulling together a group of traditional financial industry subject matter experts who understand the rules and regulations. And then, crypto industry subject matter experts to come up with a--a best of read sensible, thoughtful approach to regulation. </p><p>We know that there's a--a--a long road ahead to even get an--a--designated an SRO. But we acknowledge what it means to be an SRO and our working closely with folks at the SFDC and the SEC to figure out how we get there. </p><p>CARR: We want to pick up the SRO piece a little later--further if we have time. But Lizzie, I'd like to turn to you now. And firstly, if you could tell us a little bit about the SEC custody rule. But also, any further remarks you have and--and how I guess the SEC is responding in addressing some of the kinds of issues that Yusuf had set out there. </p><p>BAIRD: Sure. And--and it's sort of interesting that it also comes on the heels of an insurance discussion because our custody rule--Rule 15C33--also has to be viewed in conjunction with SIPA--the Securities Investors Protection Act which--which provides insurance essentially for--for securities accounts. </p><p>So, basically, the--the customer protection rule, what it does is it requires broker dealers to--to segregate and safeguard fully paid for customer securities away from the firm's own securities, so that in case of an insolvency the customers can get back all their securities. And the remaining assets are liquidated and--and used to pay off customers should there be anymore money owed to customers, and to pay other creditors. </p><p>So, a lot of issues with respect to digital assets are--are raised here because one of the requirements under the Customer Protection Rule is that the firm demonstrate that it has exclusive possession or control over the assets. </p><p>Another thing is that the firm has to verify daily and of course, regulatory examiners come in periodically, as do the firm's own auditors to verify that in fact, it is holding the assets that it's supposed to have. So, how can you do that if for example, your customer also has their private key? </p><p>If you have a key and they have their key, then you don't have exclusive possession or control. In addition, digital assets are essentially bearer assets. And so, how can you keep them safe, so that they're segregated in case of an insolvency because this is sort of where SIPAA comes in. And you've probably all seen on the door of every brokerage firm, and on the website, and stuff there's a little thing down in the corner that says SIPAA insured? </p><p>And so, that's what I'm talking about. But this is where it gets interesting because I spoke earlier about what's a security to us. Well, what's a security to SIPAA is even more narrow than what's a security to us. </p><p>So, under SIPAA, there are things that aren't securities which like us would be bitcoins, for example. Also, under SIPAA, if it is a security to us under the 33 Act or 34 Act, but it's not registered with the SEC, so it could be either brought up like per the offerings or things like that, SIPAA doesn't consider it a security. </p><p>So, they're not going to cover you on those. So, SIPAA only covers securities as defined by the 33 and 34 Act that are registered with us, okay? </p><p>So, now we're talking about a much more narrow world of assets. So, until we can solve for--when I say \"we\", I'm talking about all of you. I'm taking about the tech world being able to solve for, \"What do you do about exclusivity?\" \"What do you do about protection from theft in a world where you essentially have bearer securities?\" which most people have proposed to have out on a public blockchain. </p><p>We have a couple of alternative ideas. So, for starters we've talked a lot about the customer having securities in their own wallet. And as Yaya brought up, there's certainly ANL considerations. But as far as custody goes, customers could hold the securities themselves. </p><p>The next thing is issuers, and ATS, and exchanges that use transfer agents. So, where the transfer agent is in fact, the authoritative record for the securities, it doesn't matter what happens on the blockchain because the transfer agent themselves has the record of who owns what. </p><p>And then, finally something that I think Fidelity was one of the first to do and that is for the broker/dealer to have an affiliate that's a state-registered trust. And that state-registered trust can custody the digital assets. </p><p>So, these are just a couple of things. I know in some ways it sounds like maybe we should consider something a little bit broader and not--and not--and not kind of stick with our own rules. But let me just give you an idea of the track record. </p><p>So, SIFAA's been around since 1970. Rule 15C33's been around since 1972. </p><p>There have been 140 billion in claims from broker dealer insolvencies during that time and all, but a billion were paid out. So, you're talking about less than 1 percent of--of 140 billion in customer assets being covered. </p><p>And compare that to cyber theft. That--that has happened in a very short amount of time. And so, we're trying to figure out how do we keep that track record in--in this new area where we're exposed to new risks basically? </p><p>CARR: So, the exposure to new risks. And I think also, you've alluded to--to real world issues when we talk about theft and investment protection. </p><p>Kavita, if I could bring you in on this. To the extent that we talk about regulatory uncertainties, are we talking about, you know, I guess uncertainties that merely reflect the underlying uncertainties and the emergence of new risks that week collectively--regulators in industry as Lucy's eluded to, need to be reacting to. </p><p>JAIN: Yeah. There are a lot of factors that come into  play when--when we talk about uncertainty in the marketplace, you now. I mentioned earlier just things around how is the network setup? Who operates it? Who governs it? Is it private? Is it public? </p><p>Alex mentioned smart contracts and we know that there've been several incidents of smart contracts either having bugs in them, going array, or where the contracts don't really reflect the promises that have been made by the issuers and the creators of the contract, or, you know, in the case of say the broker dealers' are engaged in digital asset securities with their smart contracts. </p><p>Well, who is going to validate the smart contract and then show that the code in fact says what the promises have been made. Are the brokers are expected to be able to read and understand the code. So, all of these things and their business models are evolving, you know. </p><p>We know that it's come a long way, but it's only really been five, six, seven years. The technology's not been around that long. </p><p>And so, it creates a lot of complex issues and questions. And we're--we're talking about custody, but there are also questions around supervision of these networks. And disclosures of risks and ensuring that communications are made correctly to investors, that there's no kind of misleading promises or communications being made. </p><p>So, it--it just--there's--the list is ongoing. And yes, I think I agree that the--it's really a lot of uncertainty, and continued growth, and refinement, and development in the marketplace that--that's where it all starts. </p><p>BATLIN: But can I just make one point briefly? You know, suddenly in Europe trade proposals--sorry--trade reporting is still underdone. Blockchain is the perfect trade reporting system ever if you do trades on the exchange with the centralized exchanges. </p><p>And secondly, we now have provable exchanges if their smart contracts on Block Check. You have to be able to read code. How many times have various exchanges been investigated for not being able to prove that they have fair market capabilities? </p><p>So, you know, for all the issues you guys talk about, we also need to come back and say, \"What are their advantages?\" We shouldn't lose sight of that. </p><p>JAIN: No, I agree. And I--I--I think there is significant, you know, potential opportunity in--in regulators, you know, maybe 2-3 decades down really having access to a network, and being able to see real time the trades, and being able to just avail that. But we don't have one network today. We have multiple networks. We have multiple operators. They're not interoperable. </p><p>It's just virtually impossible and not practical for a regulator to go in, and set up a note, and monitor all of those on an ongoing basis. </p><p>CARR: Yaya, what about the effects of the financial standards, the Financial Action Task Force? What are the main gaps or loopholes perhaps that--that you think still need to be addressed in that space? </p><p>FANUSIE: Yeah. So, the Federal Financial Task Force is a global standard setting body. Maybe many folks know about it, but in just case, all right? </p><p>They set the rules for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing regulations around the world. And I would say that for crypto, the crypto space is sort of at a crossroads right now because of some of the changes that FAFSA is pushing for. </p><p>And while this doesn't relate directly to custody, there's probably going to be an indirect relationship. And I would actually--and I actually think that's going to maybe bifurcate the crypto space in terms of wallets. </p><p>And, you know, the reason and what the gap is, the reason is that, you know, FATIF is, you know, has set standards for all jurisdictions to--to comply with--to make sure that crypto exchanges are compliant with the Travel Rule for lack of a better term. The Travel Rule, right? </p><p>Which basically says that when financial institutions have a transfer of--of funds, the information--basic information needs to be transmitted on both sides between these two institutions and that this has to happen in crypto even though the blockchain does not record I.D. information. </p><p>And this is the--this is the standard now. So, a lot of people are looking at this interestingly and they'll say, \"Okay. If you're a financial institution\", right? </p><p>\"Your wallets that you're hosting and you--and the transfer goes from your--the wallets you have to another financial institution from Gemini to coin-base, all right?\" </p><p>For example, so the Travel Rule says that that has to be covered. That information needs to be transferred between those two points. </p><p>Now some people, let's go back to self-custody or unhosted wallet. Some people will say, \"Well, that's the trouble does not cover these unhosted wallets\" which it doesn't, you know. It doesn't cover peer-to-peer transfers. </p><p>But here's the thing, you know. Now there are efforts to try to comply I think exchanges. I think the community after resisting this travel rule push is now saying, \"Okay. We're going to have to comply.\" </p><p>Now if there's a transfer that happens with unhosted wallet, again, we say, \"Oh, that's not covered by the Travel Rule.\" My sense though is that over time, you know, institutions exchanges aren't going to be making the decisions about these unhosted wallets that don't follow under the Travel Rule. </p><p>Yes, they don't have to do anything. They can't get information maybe directly. Maybe they have to institute some new system. It means that those unhosted wallets, again may be seen as--as--as--as riskier, right? </p><p>Wallets that are pseudonymous, that no one knows and I'll just pose questions. Will unhosted wallets--will there be an effort to make people register these unhosted wallets, so that--and maybe to sort of voluntarily go into the--the Travel Rule or at least be ready to--to be taken account under the Travel Rule. </p><p>So, we--you--we may see this bifurcated system. And so, it's going to impact again, institutions. It's going to impact exchanges I would say and it's going to impact folks who think that they're not, you know, part of the regulated system even indirectly. </p><p>CARR: We're failing at my--my one task of timekeeping. It--it's time for us to be opening up to audience Q &amp; A. I wanted to just very quickly invite the--the regulators on the panel and also, I'd like to add one further comment before we do, you know. I alluded earlier to the philosophy that we're not getting around and seeing regulators talk about machine learning or about cloud. They're always anxious to learn more. </p><p>And there is this shared journey I think of regulators, and an industry upscaling, and learning together. Reminded me, Lizzie when we were speaking earlier if a great comment that Pat Chaukos said at the Ontario Securities Commission made earlier in the year that, \"We want to see safe innovation and to have safe innovation, we want the innovators to come and speak to us.\" And she made very much a very public appeal to that affect. </p><p>I was wondering very quickly either Lizzie or Kavita if there's anything you'd like to add in terms of examples at the SEC or in terms of the development of--of--of learning from industry and then upscaling. </p><p>And also, Yaya I'd just like any quick comment you could add in terms of when you look at INO regulators if I use FinCEN, Europol, you know, how you appraised it their efforts to learn more and engage in industry. Any quick comments? </p><p>BAIRD: Yeah. And I'll--I'll introduce you all to Scott Walker in the front row here who's a colleague of mine at the SEC. And he has hosted a number of sort of open-door sessions in cities all over the country where companies have been able to come in, and talk directly to him, and ask any questions that they want, and demonstrate anything that--that they want in this space. </p><p>I think just this week we had in D.C. here, a big accounting firm who was explaining to us how they verify transactions on a blockchain. That's been a big part as you heard earlier of the Customer Protection Rule. </p><p>We also had a broker dealer come in to talk to us about not only the sharing of the keys, but also their multi-signature technology to protect the keys, and--and how they do that, and how that keeps it safe. </p><p>And so, we've learned so much about this and--and folks have other ways of doing it as well. We encourage people to come in, show us how you do it. If we think you can keep the investors safe, you know, we're open to it. </p><p>CARR: Care to add anything? </p><p>JAIN: I'll add that just in the same spirit, Scott's going to give out tickets after this event. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--that a thing or two really welcomes engaging with the industry. Really all players in their ecosystem, not just real dealers, vendors. We talk extensively to academics, economists because we want to learn, you know, as the industry develops. </p><p>We formally launched the office of Financial Innovation earlier this year and the goal of the office really is to collaborate both internally and externally with like I said, all players in the ecosystem. And also, with our co-regulators, so that we are jointly learning, and sharing kind of ideas, and concerns, and what we have in this space. </p><p>So, feel free to reach out to us. We have an inbox--email address. It's financial innovation at FINRA dot org, or you can come and talk to me anytime. </p><p>CARR: Yeah? </p><p>FANUSIE: Yeah. I'll just say just real quick in terms of our regulators. All our jurisdictions' are not created equal in terms of how they're moving. And people will often say, \"Oh, we'll U.S.  is--is behind.\" </p><p>But looking for--through an AML lens, I would say the U.S.  actually has been ahead, has had guidance since 2013. There's been clarity. </p><p>So, in terms of the AML regulations, U.S.  has been--has been--has really it would've been--I think would be graded A. </p><p>In Europe, you know, there are a lot of issues, but you mentioned Europol and Europol does a good effort bringing together regulators and industry every year. </p><p>And I think the folks who dial with law enforcement, or cyber minded folks are really ahead with crypto. But again, every jurisdiction is not the same. </p><p>I recently went to Seoul, Korea actually last week and was talking to some history folks there. And one person shared the sort of cultural difference. He--his observation of the U.S.  versus Korea where he said, \"In--in the U.S.  if there's a--if there is an empty street and there's no sign there that says, you know, no parking in the U.S.  everyone would park there.\" </p><p>But he said, \"No, in Korea if there's a sign--I mean, if there's a street and there's no sign there, you shouldn't park there. And if that's the view that the regulators there think about crypto, then they haven't given guidance or sufficient guidance. And they're upset that people are doing stuff. </p><p>So---so, it really depends on--on--on where we're talking about--on which jurisdiction we're talking about. </p><p>CARR: That's an interesting point actually and I'll probably say more widely on a lot of innovation topics we do. So, there are cases where the industry would like to see more guidance, more--and in some ways, it's the need for regulation to be sufficiently principle space that it can be dynamic, that it can stand the test of time and--and--and not be constrained by a particular technology, but that also needs to be complemented by guidance that helps to--to set the path, and describe what is, and is not allowable perhaps. </p><p>I'm conscious we should've gone to audience questions already, so let's make sure that we do that now. Do--we've got one down the front here and--and another shortly over. Let's take these couple of comments. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah. My name's Tom Gross. I'm with George Washington University. Quick question for the regulators. How are you viewing the emergence of asset-backed tokens? And by those, I mean, tokens that are backed by for example, commodities--gold, silver, a piece of art, not a real estate apartment building which obviously depends on management. But an asset-backed token where you'll see fluctuation in market value, but not due to the efforts of others. How do you view that from your regulatory standpoint? </p><p>CARR: Tom, thank you for that. Let's also get--there was another question in the third row here. We can get that as well and then I'll let our panelists respond. </p><p>Raise your hand? Just around the third row by the aisle. </p><p>BAIRD: I--I haven't seen that perspective. </p><p>CARR: Just a second. We'll--we'll take the two questions together please. Okay, go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION: Sure, yeah. Hi, I'm Sarah Austin, Financial Department at Oracle Corporation. This is for Kavita and Yaya. Just wanted to ask you guys about how can organizations from tech and law enforcement through financial institutions and NGOs come together to collaborate and share intelligence to build a safer and more transparent financial services industry? </p><p>CARR: Lizzie, I'm sorry to cut you off there, but let's talk about that first question which was about commodity-backed tokens if I can call it that. Not backed or mineral backed. </p><p>BAIRD: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't seen asset backed tokens here. I would think that from a securities standpoint, we would deal with them the same way we deal with other asset backed securities. </p><p>And--and then, they would I would presume present the same challenges that other digital assets present. But I--I--I haven't seen them, so I'm not sure. </p><p>BAIRD: Yeah, I haven't. I haven't seen them in the broker-dealer world either, so. </p><p>CARR: And Kavita, if you want to continue, then I think the second question was in part to you in terms of collaboration opportunities. </p><p>JAIN: So, like I mentioned earlier we do collaborate a lot and generally, you know one-on-one. We talked with several industry trade associations so to speak. We collaborate with regulators and figure out the Digital Assets Regulatory Form. </p><p>Every year the regulators get together around the room--around a table in the room and just share best practices, things that we're seeing, areas of concerns, exam findings, so there was collaboration going on. </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>CARR: Just to repeat the question for anyone who didn't hear, I think the question was about how can anyone else deliberate? </p><p>JAIN: How does everyone else? </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>HUSSAIN: Maybe I can take a stab at that. So, as I had mentioned before, maybe there's been a couple of calls to action by regulators for the industry to self-regulate. So, it's the industry' responsibility to respond to those calls to action in terms of providing transparency, in terms of the information sharing. That's the intent of what we're trying to do with the Virtual Commodity association. </p><p>I think as--as the panelists have mentioned, there's collaboration with the regulators. We had to--we had--the VCA, as well as Gemini have engaged with FinHub, with the SEC. I think it's on the industry to make sure that they engage early and engage often with regulators, and view industry participants or industry not participants, but market places as a collaborative as opposed to competitors. I think that's a hurdle that we need to get over. </p><p>If we can collaborate with appropriate rules, with appropriate standards, we can further the industry. </p><p>FANUSIE: And I'd also say that it'd be my fault. Consider that the crypto space is sort of low barriers for entry in a lot of ways, right? </p><p>But also, low barriers for engagement that it's sort of small community, people interact, it's very easy to, you know, there's maybe less hierarchy. And actually, I would say D.C. I was talking to someone earlier about the importance of being--having a presence in D.C.</p><p>D.C. has a really important role compared to the--contrasted with the west coast and New York City, right? </p><p>Because you have here regulators, obviously. You have a lot of NGOs that are here--folks that are interested in development, right? </p><p>So, you have all these people and you-you have-----industry should have a presence here, right? If you--if you have legal counsel and whatnot. So, interacting in D.C. is probably the thing I would say to a lot of organizations more so than just, you know, what's happening in -in--in the other centers of industry. </p><p>BATLIN: I think it's called a telegram. Most people go on a telegram rant as you know. </p><p>CARR: But--but--but stay away from Twitter. </p><p>We've got time. We've got time for one more question or maybe two quick ones. Are there any others? Any other audience questions? </p><p>Look--look, if not, I'm going to give the final word to Kavita with a question I was--was holding up my sleeve. Yusuf talked a little bit about the Virtual Commodities association whereas the person on the Board of Directors and that's, you know, as he outlined, might have some inspirations around perhaps being a self-regulatory organization. But there's a lot of formalities and in effect as to what that really means. </p><p>From a thinner perspective, you are a self-regulating organization in a formalized, and--and legislative since. Are there any learnings from thinner experience that you would call out from the likes of the VCA if they're to go back on their direction. </p><p>JAIN: Sure. So, just for those of you who are not familiar, FINRA is a self-regulatory organization. We were formed in response to the Maloney Act. I think in 1985 we were formed, so we're abut eight years older. And we're supervised by the SEC, authored and it really--we really take a very broad view with respect to overseeing the industry. </p><p>So, we write rules, we enforce them, we examine forms on a regular basis. We host several transparency services, utilities and we also engage in investor education. </p><p>I would say in terms of learnings, really, we support innovation. We would love to, you know, foster innovation and see developments in the industry because ultimately, benefits investors. But all the work that we do is really ground--grounded in our mission of protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. And that's really been, you know, our North Star. </p><p>CARR: So, that's probably a good underlying note to--to finish on. </p><p>I won't try and summarize the discussion given the--given the constraints of time. I will call out one thing I thought was really quite fascinating was the point about Nick's mutual doing insurance on each smart contract transaction. That's certainly one takeaway that I'll go and research a bit further. And it could be a fascinating one to watch in the future, but we'll leave it there. </p><p>Please join me in thanking Yaya, Yusuf, Alex, Kavita and Lizzie. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>NOLAN: Yes, thank you to our panel for another great conversation today. </p><p>Thank you to those who are just joining if those are just joining either in person or watching the live stream. My name's Mike Nolan and I'm VP of Content at CQ Roll Call. Very proud to have partnered with Chris Rummer on--with CQ Roll Call, and Car Coverage of FinTech in the industry, and being a part of this year's D.C. FinTech week. </p><p>So, with that, I am delighted to introduce Chairman of the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton. </p><p>Chairman Clayton was nominated on the 20th of January, 2017 by President Donald Trump. Prior to joining SE--the SEC, Chairman Clayton was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell where he's a mem--where he was a member of the firm's management committee and co-head of the firm's corporate practice. From 2009 to 2017, Chairman Clayton was a lecturer and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Interviewing Brad is DC Fintech's Week founder and cofounder and host of CQ's Roll Call's podcast Fintech Beat, Professor Chris Brummer. I'll turn it over to you guys. </p><p>BRUMMER: Chairman Clayton, thank you so very, very, very much for taking the time out. I know that you're a busy person. These are deeper chairs. </p><p>CLAYTON: These are deeper chairs. I feel like-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --These are deeper chairs. You sit down, you're, like-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --I feel like we're going to watch a football game. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah, I do. I do. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But, thank you very much. I know you're very busy. And--and just to take the time to--to talk to us is--it's really a--a--a delight. </p><p>It's a pretty busy week. It's been a busy couple weeks in the--in the crypto world. Obviously, we have interesting discussions going off on the Hill, but even prior to that, we've had a number of international agencies as well as the SEC issue a number of statements relating to cryptocurrencies and to digital assets more generally. </p><p>I guess I'll just start off with sort of the big elephant in--in the room, which is as we speak, we--we've had some interesting conversations with Mark Zuckerberg obviously testifying before the Hill. What's your--your--your view generally about the--the role of stablecoins, the regulation of sta--stablecoins and the amount of attention that's been generated both on the Hill and, obviously, in the crypto community? </p><p>Is--do you find this a positive development? And what kinds of challenges do you think stablecoins are like Libra and opportunities, what do they pose for you sitting in your chair? </p><p>CLAYTON: Okay. So, thank you for having me. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you. </p><p>CLAYTON: Been very nice. And it was nice to meet your students outside. </p><p>BRUMMER: Absolutely. </p><p>CLAYTON: And talk to them. </p><p>BRUMMER: Hoya Saxa. </p><p>CLAYTON: And I thought the--I got--yeah, well done. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CLAYTON: And I thought the panel--the previous panel did a great job of talking about these issues. So, that was nice. And I also have to hit the--hit the usual disclaimer that my views are my own, not the views of the commission or any of the staff. It's just me speaking-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --I won't take it against them. </p><p>CLAYTON: Me speaking for myself. So, to your question about stablecoins, let me say a couple of things. One is the--and I'm not going to talk--please don't take anything I say as a comment about a specific product or not, to be clear. But, the--the--the--I will say the level--the--raising the level of consciousness beyond the fintech community that the recent discussion of stablecoins has--has provided I think is a very good thing. I think a lot of people across the regulatory landscape, across, you know, what I'll--what I'll say the--the political and governmental class-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Are now paying attention to this technology and what it means. I will say throughout the hierarchy--and I don't know which way the hierarchy goes, but securities, commodities, currencies, payment systems, payment systems, which--whichever way it goes. People are now paying attention more, talking to each other more because I think people do realize this is--this has the potential to be quite a transformative technology. </p><p>BRUMMER: Right. From a regulatory standpoint, you know, just the world of cryptocurrencies is--is--is vast, right? They just--in terms of whether or not they're looking--you have cryptocurrency that's looking to operate as a payment, a payment system, sort of a social network in and of itself or a programmable form of money. </p><p>CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. </p><p>BRUMMER: And right from that, I'm just talking from a purely functional standpoint-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Much less the--the regulatory questions. One of the--Bill Hinman had made some very interesting comments that have--about the fact that you can have a financial product that sort of evolves from the status of a--of a security. And--and--and you yourself have made some comments about the fact that you can have a digital asset that may start off as a security but it may ultimately obtain a status because it's so decentralized or the way it's operating, that it's--it's finding itself more into the world of--of commodities. </p><p>Earlier in the week with--with FinTech, we--we had Heath Tarbert. </p><p>CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. </p><p>BRUMMER: And Chairman Tarbert from the CFTC had made a comment about Ethereum that I'm sure you--you've heard, observing from his chair, from his position that Ethereum is--is a commodity. Do you share that--that--that assessment? </p><p>CLAYTON: Well, let--let me say this. I think--I think Director Henneman in the past has made it clear that from--from his point of view, it's not a security. I'll--I'll defer to Chairman Tarbert on whether it's a commodity or not. How's that? </p><p>BRUMMER: That's pretty good. One of the challenges from a regulatory standpoint-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --And--and--and you hear this a lot from--from industry is that when you can have this--this idea of which, on its face, you know, it--it--it certainly makes some--some intuitive sense of being able to evolve from one legal status to the--to the other is that it--it also creates interesting supervisory challenges, right? </p><p>CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. </p><p>BRUMMER: Because now, you have to figure out when you look at whatever product, what was it perhaps like at T1 and then what is it at T2? And then, if a financial product evolves from being one thing into--into something else, you know, how is the baton passing going to operate as a--from an interagency perspective? </p><p>CLAYTON: And it--let's be clear. It may be both. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYTON: It's not--right? You say it--it evolves as if there's some kind of--how--how do I say it? Binary nature. That's kind of a pun, but-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Well, yeah-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CLAYTON: --Between--between where--you know, when something goes from a security to something that you would consider a currency or payment system. But, I'm sure that people who regulate payment systems, you know, might think that something became a currency and part of a payment system while--while it's still a security. </p><p>BRUMMER: I guess I was-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --And just because something may be used for payments doesn't mean it's not a security. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, you know--you know, it--it was--the nature of the comments was-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Right? If I--if I--if I hand you a bearer bond as payment for services, that bearer bond is still a security. </p><p>BRUMMER: It is. </p><p>CLAYTON: But, I may be using it as a form of payment. </p><p>BRUMMER: Absolutely. I--I think that the--the question was or the--the--the nature of the comment was, from his standpoint--and I'm--literally, I'm just sort of parodying his observation that usually the CFTC chooses to defer to the SEC whenever you have a financial product that, you know, is a security but is--but is also a commodity. </p><p>CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. </p><p>BRUMMER: And if you have something that evolves into a state-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --I'm glad to hear that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. No. No. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>He was--I know. He was--he was--he was pretty good. You know, he also--however, he </p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>It's also going to require a certain kind of dialogue with--with the SEC. I--I'm sure you've heard, there are some people who have wanted more certainty from the--the SEC as to the designation of different kinds of financial products. You know, when you think about the question of regulatory uncertainty, both at T1, but also this added dimension of the evolution of a financial product-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --How do you--how would you rate the agency's performance in terms of providing the uncertainty? And--and even more importantly, what do you see as your toolbox for addressing uncertainty? </p><p>Are--are--are you satisfied with that toolbox? Do you think it needs to evolve? Do you think there are additional powers or--or other forms of assistance that can be useful to the agency in--in--in thinking through the question of uncertainty? </p><p>CLAYTON: So, I think--I think the most powerful tool in the toolbox is dialogue and whether it's through FinHub or meetings with Director Hinman or--I--I saw Associate Director Baird here, who's, I think, very articulate on some of the issues around custody and whatnot. You know, dialogue and--and--and we're open for dialogue and we actually want that dialogue to then facilitate private sector dialogue-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Right? </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYTON: I mean, private sector dialogue, private sector innovation. The--the securities laws have long depended and the SEC has long depended on private sector actors understanding the law and trying to conform their behavior to the--to the law, right? I mean, we--we--we utilize gatekeepers-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --For a reason, yeah-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --For a reason. Now, we--you know, we--we lay out broad principles. We try to provide guidance. But, we--we do expect the--let me just put it very bluntly. We do expect the private sector participants to implement those principles faithfully and not be operating to try to evade those principles. That's a longstanding, you know, kind of deal we have with the private sector and the way our laws have been structured. </p><p>You know, back in '33, '34 when we established the--the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, it could've been a approved, disapprove merit based regulatory system for securities we would allow to be sold to the public. We didn't do that. We had a disclosure base system with disclosure parameters and processes and then liability for people who didn't follow them. And that's--and that's--and that system has worked extremely well for 85 years. </p><p>BRUMMER: Again, you know, one of the--the privileges that--that--that I've--get to--to have during fintech week and I think that the audience gets--gets to sort of share in is listening to people who--who are on the front lines of the--of the regulatory questions, getting a sense of different personalities and--and--and sort of viewpoints as to the--the--the clarity of law within their own sort of jurisdictional ambit-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Or--or-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Or perimeter. And, you know, on--on--on Monday, we had Director Blanco talking about the email issues, particularly-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --In--in light of the SEC, CFTC, and--and FinCEN joint guidance. And he spoke a little bit as--as to sort of his view of the--of the regulatory perimeter and--and his expectations. And he was--he felt very certain and--and that's sort of an understatement-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --As to sort of how se--I'm sorry--a--email, KYC expectations should be applied to market participants. </p><p>CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. </p><p>BRUMMER: And, you know--but, he did sort of say, you know, that's a--a relatively straightforward kind of line as to whether or not you're acting as--whether or not in the--in the--in the crypto world as an exchanger or not. You know, you know who you are kind of question. </p><p>Do you feel satisfied when you look at the private market participants that there is an understanding as to--particularly when you look at--at the crypto industry that there--that there is an understanding as to how rules apply. And I don't even--I'm not even making a statement about the SEC more--more generally. It's just that when you travel around the country, it is fascinating because people have different opinions as to sort of the scope and--and--and whether or not certain kinds of rules implicate them. But, are you satisfied with their understanding? </p><p>And then, when you look at certain kinds of private initiatives, you know, you see exchanges who are trying to create sort of ratings of financial products as to, you know, how close to the line they may be coming or not. I mean, when you look at how the private sector is responding to the question of uncertainty, do--do you think that there's more that they can or should be doing to help not just engage you but to engage in the process of--of--of creating more--more--more--more--more clarity as to how they understand those rules to be impacting them? </p><p>CLAYTON: Well, I--I think there's been--I think there's been progress in that we're seeing--let me say this. We're seeing fewer and fewer examples of blatant violations of the securities laws. You know, I--I don't think anybody now thinks that you can take a 10 page description of a venture where you're seeking to raise money and you're going to invest it. And what you're giving people is an expectation of a return and you're going to blast that out and have people sign up using their credit card with no verification as to what type of investor they are. </p><p>We were seeing a ton of that. I don't think there's anybody who has looked at the securities laws, looked at our website--and I'm not talking about lawyers who--you know, and--and--and engage in this debate who would now think that that was okay. </p><p>BRUMMER: Right. </p><p>CLAYTON: It's not okay. If anybody thinks it's okay, it's not okay. </p><p>BRUMMER: That was a very Ken Blanco moment, by the way. </p><p>CLAYTON: Yeah. Okay. </p><p>BRUMMER: We were there on Monday. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>He was very, very clear, though. </p><p>CLAYTON: But, look it, if--if you want to use distributed ledger technology, smart contracts in a private placement setting, wonderful. Wonderful. You're offering to credit investors 506, you know, do those things. </p><p>If you want to use it in a public offering setting and come in and register with us, wonderful. We'll work with you. We'll he--we'll--we'll help you make sure that, you know, transitioning from, you know, paper or an entry that's in a--a clearinghouse to, you know, a smart contract as a way to, you know, evidence your rights in that, we're--we're--we're open to that. We're very open to it. </p><p>But, you can't have wide distribution to the retail public with trading and not have the protections of the Securities Act. </p><p>BRUMMER: And that is--you know, as I put on my professorial hat, extremely important not just for the sort of smaller players, but also for--for any players-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Right-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Who's--who's--who's engaged in-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --And that's not just the SEC. Like, if we want to change the whole thing-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Right-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --You know, if we want to say, let's--let's go to a free for all, got to go to Congress and have Congress say, let's--let's do that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Do--do you think that would be helpful? </p><p>CLAYTON: What's that? </p><p>BRUMMER: A congressional intervention of some sort to either A, outline the perimeter for crypto assets or digital assets or--or--or B, to sort of provide more--more certainty as to the approach. And I mention this because we--we did hear some reports over the week. Certainly, there have been a number of very important and high profile enforcement actions from the SEC. Some market participants have felt that there's sort of an inconsistency or--or different messages being sent in those enforcement actions. And so, then, you get more of a call for a congressional solution. </p><p>How would you speak to both, again, you know, the opportunity of if I was to look at--at this--at the tool set, you have your informal guidance, you have, obviously, enforcement actions, you have your formal rulemaking. You know, when you're--looking at that suite of--of options, you know, do you see consistency? And then, again, is a--would you be--would you welcome congressional empowerment of--of some way or another to help you do your job? </p><p>CLAYTON: I--one of--one of the things I try to do in my job is--is--is not to tell Congress what to do. That's-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRUMMER: --Whereas law professors-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Yeah. Yeah. You--you have--you have--you have-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --I have all kinds of suggestions. </p><p>CLAYTON: You have license to do-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah. </p><p>CLAYTON: I should--I should turn the question around and say what do you--what do you think? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Yeah. I--look, in--in--let me--let me speak--again, to be clear, I'm speaking for myself. I think in the securities space, in the space where you're--you're raising money and doing so on a--on a--on a disaggregated basis with, you know--with anonymity as to who your investors are and, you know, that kind of thing, this is really well settled-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --How we approached this and how we did it. But, you brought up a--a--a more interesting point. I think the dynamic nature of these assets and the problems that they're trying to solve across the regulatory and financial spectrum, that is kind of new. </p><p>BRUMMER: It is. </p><p>CLAYTON: Right? </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYTON: Okay. Like, I'm pretty confident in our space. We have expertise. And, you know, if you--what--what you want to do is, you know, facilitate custody, if you want to facilitate security interests, if you want to facilitate a better understanding of verification of who the owners are and those types of things, you know, we're--we're for that. But, that's kind of squarely within what we do. </p><p>In terms of international payments and some of the other aspects of a--of a store of value and a currency and whatnot, you know, there--there--there may--there may be more room to take a fresh look at this space. </p><p>BRUMMER: How do you view or--or what are you hearing from others about any potential cyber risk? Not just with crypto. I--I want to broaden the discussion a little bit now to sort of fintech more--more generally and the financial market infrastructure. </p><p>CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. </p><p>BRUMMER: Is--is--is cybersecurity and the fact that you are having--you still have legacy financial infrastructures that are obviously available to--to--to--to hacks and--and--and malware and you have different kinds of solution providers and vendors who are proliferating just as the number of options for executing payments. And--and the payment structures are proliferating. </p><p>I mean, how do you keep track of, you know, the--the kinds of cyber risk that can pop up almost anywhere? And--and the resilience question that--that sort of accompanies it. You know, the SEC is being transformed into not just a disclosure driven-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --You know, regulator, but, you know, is really involved in--in--in--in deeper questions of--of keeping the economy afloat in the case of some kind of critical market infrastructure problems. How do you approach that? Do you think fintech is presenting new--new kinds of challenges in terms of how you--you exercise that oversight? </p><p>CLAYTON: New--new challenges and hopefully new solutions, right? So, we--we have a challenge in--in this country and I'll--I'll--I'll bring it back to our securities infrastructure, but, you know, it's financial infrastructure. We are extremely data dependent. And the faster transactions have become, the--the--the greater our expectations for speed and--and--and speed of information and whatnot. We have become extremely data dependent in virtually all aspects of our securities markets. </p><p>I--I'll quickly answer your question and try to do it in three parts. There's infrastructure. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYTON: Right? And we--we deal with infrastructure. We--we--our--our compliance inspections group has a special group that looks at market infrastructure, clearinghouses, exchanges, et cetera. Do they have the type of security and resiliency that we would expect? And I say both because you need security, but you also need a plan if the security doesn't work. Resiliency is a key part of that. </p><p>We have companies largely disclosure based approach. Companies, tell your investors what your cyber risks are, how you're managing them, you know, both from a--you know, this--these are the risks we face. And then, if they actually come to fruition, what happened, how you're dealing with it. </p><p>And then, lastly, you know, let's look at the--the retail customer in the retail space. How are brokers, et cetera, protecting their information? And are they doing there--are they doing a good job there? We look at all of those things. </p><p>You know, there--there--there's hope that is particularly in the--in the resiliency area that fintech will provide some solutions and that you know you have some type of immutable record you-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Right-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Can go back to in the event you have a problem. So--but, look, this is a--this is something that the problems of today are different from the problems of five years ago and the problems of five years from now will be different from the problems of today and we have to be cognizant of that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Great. I know we're just a--a--a couple of questions in the back. But, I did want to just also as we get a microphone to those folks who do and maybe it's just better to maybe line up or--or raise your hand and keep them up. </p><p>But, it has been--you talk about the problems of yesterday. It's been about eight years since the--the Jobs Act and I was just curious if would give any grade to that legislation. You know, retroactively, when you look back and you look at how the crypto industry and--and others and--and start ups have sort of glommed on to it. And to think about fundraising. </p><p>Are you satisfied with sort of where we stand? It's been its own kind of bridge legislation, enabling all kinds of transactions. Anything that you think you'd want to--want to change? </p><p>CLAYTON: Well, let me--let me say it this way. I believe in the broad principles of our securities laws. You know, if you have a public distribution, you have to have good disclosure, a robust liability set, you know, that type of thing. That doesn't mean that the regulations that implement those principles shouldn't constantly be reviewed and updated. I think the Jobs Act was a good example of that. </p><p>It was basically, hey, Sarbanes-Oxley, ton of good stuff in there. I think one of the greatest things for investors was having that independent audit committee introduced by Sarbanes-Oxley. Huge bang for the buck to have somebody in there looking--looking at-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Right-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --The relationship between management and the auditors and asking the--the hard questions. Not a huge cost. You know, find--find high quality people to populate that audit committee and have them do their job. </p><p>You know, there are other things about Sarbanes-Oxley that needed to be recalibrated over time. The Jobs Act, I think, did a very good job of recalibrating some of those issues. We've extended some of those Jobs Act provisions-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --To additional companies. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYTON: I think that's been very good. It's actually helped investors and helped companies. And it's not a tradeoff. It is not a tradeoff. It's--investor protection has increased. Investor opportunity has increased. And, you know, the--the company has more costs. </p><p>BRUMMER: Right. </p><p>CLAYTON: And--and so, more flexibility. So, look, I'm--I'm pretty satisfied with--with the Jobs Act. </p><p>BRUMMER: So, good. A question? Maybe you'll want to stand up or identify yourself. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah. So, Aaron Stanley with CoinDesk. Thanks so much for being here. It's really great. </p><p>Just I was hoping you could address the--the Eos settlement that came out a couple of weeks ago. And I know in the kind of the crypto community, there's a lot of kind of confusion as to the--the size of that. It was, like--it was, like, a 23 or $24 million settlement. And when these guys had raised, like, $4 billion over a yearlong ICO and there was some--I mean, I think there's a lot of confusion as to what type of message the SEC was sending by imposing, like, sort of, you know, maybe perhaps, like, such a small penalty for what some people viewed as a very egregious token sale. </p><p>So, I was just wondering maybe--and then, that kind of ties into what I think, Chris, you were kind of hinting at earlier with some of the discrepancies. </p><p>BRUMMER: And we're going to take two questions. So, the--the gentleman right in front of you who's raising his hand as well. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Tim Griffin, avid XRP investor. And you know that Brad's up next. So, I'm going to ask </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>this question for him. I think it's a softball. I think it's--it's an easy question, but we'll see. He might slap me later. Will the SEC rule on XRP? And when, if they will? </p><p>CLAYTON: Wow. So, bo-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah. Softballs. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CLAYTON: Yeah. So--now, so, look, you know, we--we don't--we don't comment on specific enforcement matters or--or--or whether we're--matters that are under review or (INAUDIBLE). It would be--it would be inappropriate to do so. What I will say is on enforcement matters generally, there are a number of factors that go into the assessment of--of any remedial action. One of--one of the--the matters that--you--you think about is how much of the conduct occurred in--in--in--inside or outside of the United States, investor loss, those types of things. </p><p>But, you know, I--I can't comment specifically on any action. And--and in term--terms of, you know, any--any particular product, I'm--I'm just not in a position to comment. But, I--I--I appreciate--I appreciate the sentiment underlying your question, which is--understood. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, I--I want to tell the audience--I mean, Chairman Clayton and his office, they really had to go through an extraordinary effort just to make it here and I know you have a-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Yeah-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --A very important meeting at the commission. But, logistically, it was very, very kind of you-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --No-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --To even just come--come by. </p><p>CLAYTON: Thank you. </p><p>BRUMMER: And I--and I do appreciate-- </p><p>CLAYTON: --Thank you-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --You stopping by. </p><p>CLAYTON: Thank you for including me. I really appreciate it. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you. Thank you. </p><p>NOLAN: Thank you, Chairman Clayton and Chris. Right now, we are going to take about a 10 minute break--10 minute, 15 minute break. So, if you want to grab something to drink or whatever and we'll be back here in about 10, 15 minutes. Thank you. </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>NOLAN: I'm delighted to welcome Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse to the stage, along with Chris. Prior to Ripple, Brad served as the CEO of the file collaboration service Hightail. From 2009 to 2012, he was president of consumer applications at AOL and held--and prior to that, held previous executive positions at Yahoo from 2003 to 2009, including senior vice president. </p><p>Early in his career, Brad helped to--to pioneer the voice over IP industry as CEO of Dialpad Communications. He currently serves on the board of directors of OutMatch and has held board positions at Ancestry.com and Tonic Health. And interviewing Brad is Chris. And I will turn it over to you guys. </p><p>BRUMMER: Great. Great. Brad, thank you so very, very much for coming by to-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Glad to be here-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --To get out of Silicon Valley to D.C.'s-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --The echo chamber of Silicon Valley. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, because we know nothing of that here </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>in--in Washington. No, seriously. Thank you. We know that you're--you're--you're really busy. And--and the fact that we have so many great participants throughout the week from--from industry, from a couple of regulators, and--and--and from really folks who are on the front lines in the crypto space and watching space, it's--it's just a delight to have you. </p><p>So, today, as--as I had mentioned ear--earlier with Chairman Clayton, pretty big day in Washington. We have Mark Zuckerberg, who has been testifying on the Hill and we've been gathering sort of interesting snippets of--of--of information. And I know you've been keeping an--an eye also on--on his remarks. </p><p>I just want to start off with asking you what's your impression of the Libra project and-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --You mean White Paper. </p><p>BRUMMER: This is true. This is true. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Just so we're clear. </p><p>BRUMMER: The--the--the--this is--this--that's absolutely true. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>The--the Libra White Paper and sort of the--the--the buzz of good and bad that--that it's sort of generated and--and the attention-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Yeah-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --That is directed towards--towards the crypto industry. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Well, so, I'll start with--I mean, you just look at even this event, you look at how far this industry has come in really not that long of time. And I--I think it's incredibly positive for the whole industry. You know, Chris and I spoke earlier this morning and one of the things I--we kind of mutually observed is had you predicted that, you know, the CEO and chairman of one of the most valuable companies on the planet would be testifying in front of Congress about crypto and that the president, regardless of what you think of his tweets-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Was tweeting-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Was tweeting about crypto. You know, it's just amazing to me how far the industry has come. You know, look, Libra specifically, the White Paper, I think there's a lot of things still to be figured out. You know, when the White Paper first came out, it was very much kind of positioned more as it was going to be a new fiat currency. They backtracked on that. </p><p>You know, today, in the testimony, they talked about it being in a way to extend America's financial leadership. But, last time I checked, Libra's based in Switzerland. That's a little confusing. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Look, I--I--I think any time you have a White Paper, it's early. </p><p>BRUMMER: And some of-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --And you're figuring stuff out-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Said it was a new global currency. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. </p><p>BRUMMER: Compared to the American currency. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I mean, look, I--I really do--and--and some of you have heard me say this, but at Ripple, we think a lot about--we want the whole crypto ecosystem to thrive. I genuinely believe that--I don't look out there at other projects and think, oh, that's going to--that's bad for Ripple. Most of these projects, like, if they're good--if they're successful, I think that's good for crypto, it's good for blockchain, it's, by extension, good for Ripple. </p><p>You know, Ripple is today if not the leader in this space, one of the leaders without question. And so, I think I want the whole industry to grow. I--I view it as analogous to when I moved to Silicon Valley in 1997 and the internet, as we know it today, was still a little, you know-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>tiny embryo growing. And I think it's kind of analogous to where we see crypto and blockchain today. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, speaking then of--of--of Ripple--and I think it's really useful. You--you know, we have some world famous economists and--and--and lawyers and policymakers scattered in the crowd, but there are lots of cryptocurrencies. And, you know, one of the--the questions that was always sort of was tagged along with the conversations on Libra is, you know, are--are--are people able to just differentiate the different cryptocurrencies? And each one, particularly the more established cryptocurrencies, but even some of the--the--the sort of startup cryptocurrencies have varying, you know, ecosystems with--with the different-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Right-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Features to them. So, maybe you can just walk our audience through, you know, what Ripple does. And to walk through the X--like, the particular cryptocurrency of XRP is designed to do. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. So, in its simplest form, Ripple is an enterprise software company that sells software to banks and financial institutions. We use as part of our tech stack a--a open source digital asset called XRP. We own a lot of XRP. And so, we are certainly interested in the success of that broadly defined. </p><p>But, you know, I think there's a lot of intentional misinformation and sometimes just confusion in the marketplace about what is Ripple versus what is XRP. You know, and that has, I think--the--the misinformation and the FUD that gets spread, I think it's kind of bad for the whole industry and makes it harder. </p><p>I mean, I--you know, Chairman Clayton, who I think it's also just a huge sign of how far--far we've come that the chairman of the SEC is coming here and spending time with us is, I think, a big positive deal. I give him a huge shout out and a round of applause for that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I--I think that the misinformation makes it harder for regulators to do their job. You know, as Chris knows, you know, one of the announcements that Ripple has made this week is we're opening a DC office at a time when I think a lot of companies and space are running away from DC. We're running towards DC. </p><p>We announced the--the creation of the office. And Michelle Bond, who's here, is going to be leading that office. And we announced that Craig Phillips, who formerly was a counselor to Secretary Mnuchin and the Treasury joined our board of directors. I think they're both indications that we are continuing to invest and making sure there's clarity in Washington, clarity, frankly, globally, with how digital assets--you know, the different functions, the different forms. </p><p>I--I think as Chris knows, I--I think it's very dangerous to paint any industry with one broad brush. And I think that's certainly to--true in the crypto community. And when that happens, I think we're doing a disservice to those that are maybe working more constructively with industry as opposed to those who are trying to circumvent regulation and circumvent laws. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and--and again sort of getting to XRP itself, you know, cryptocurrencies, and particular when you get into the world of regulation, it's all a question of--of definitions. Both definitions from a regulatory standpoint, but also definitions from a--a market and industry standpoint. And it--it's--it's fascinating because, you know, if you were to ask your average American, your average American knows, on the one hand, they've maybe heard of Bitcoin. </p><p>And because of what happens on the Hill, they've--they've--know that Facebook has something. Maybe they'll know what the word Libra is. And then, in between, you know, it's--it's anyone's guess--mu--much--much less the--the smaller cryptocurrencies. </p><p>But, with XRP, you describe the--you know, its--its use case as not so much a cryptocurrency, but as a bridge currency. Could you just sort of walk us through what that is supposed to mean as--as a use case? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. Well, I'll first talk--I'll--I'll--I will get to describe what that means as use case. I'll first describe why I don't typically refer to XRP as a cryptocurrency. And frankly, I don't refer to Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency also because I did happen to go to Starbucks earlier today and it's about two doors over. And I used--actually, I used a Visa card to pay for it. I could've used my Starbucks app. I could've used dollars. </p><p>But, the--the--the challenge sometimes in Silicon Valley, the echo chamber I was referring to earlier is you have technologies in search of a problem versus a problem in search of a technology. And I think for tier one economies, let's say the G20, it's not clear to me that the currencies in those markets--you--you--the dollar works well, the yen works well, the Euro--Euro works well. And I don't see these things as penetrating consumer use cases at scale any time soon. </p><p>Now, people often point out, you have economies where you don't have a strong fiat currency and I think that's a different story. The way we are using XRP is really to solve an institutional liquidity problem. So, today, as many of you guys know--well, actually, many of you may not know, but the way banks--the way banks manage money is they'll prefund. And so, they Bank of Chris, you can be the Mexican peso, I'll be the U.S.  dollar. I would--the Bank of Brad would prefund to the Bank of Chris. I'd put, you know, $20 million there. Then, over time, that would get debited. </p><p>BRUMMER: Right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: And then, I would reup. But, that means there's dormant capital sitting in almost the--the engine that is corresponded banking, the engine that is international payments, any engine needs oil. The oil that exists in international payments is that prefunding. That prefunding represents $10 trillion of prefunded just kind of dormant capital sitting there to grease that engine. </p><p>If we as--what Ripple's trying to do is we can make that $10 billion down to $9 billion down to 5, you've massively made the global economic engine more efficient. You can take that $5 trillion--went from $10 trillion to $5 trillion and you could reinvest it in all kinds of stuff, whether it's--you could do dividends, you could do working capital, you could hire more people. You could, you know, fill in blank. That's just good for everybody. </p><p>By reducing the friction on these kinds of payments, I--I think you will find that segments of the population that are under banked or unbanked can now--we can offer products to them. You know, when we talk about the unbanked and under banked, people often, I think, get confused because banks--the Bank of Chris is a profit motivated entity. You're a capitalist. You want to--if--if you could serve a customer and profit-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --But, a fine bank. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: A--a fine bank. A very reputable bank. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Just don't do a tier one capital issue. </p><p>BRUMMER: Couple of--yeah. Right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Sorry. That was a little bank humor. That didn't work. Yeah. Sorry. </p><p>Anyway, the point being, I think we can make the whole industry way more efficient and Ripple's very focused on that. We're trying to use XRP for that purpose. And I think that broad brush of crypto sometimes--you know, people don't understand the different use cases. </p><p>Look, I'll--I'll tell you one other interesting shout out, Congressman Budd today, the representative from North Carolina, asked a question of Mark Zuckerberg. And the point--he was questioned--the construct was roughly, look, there's digital assets like Bitcoin, ether, and XRP, and how do you compare that--and, you know, those are digital assets. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: And it--you know, I--I think the--the regulatory clarity is helpful and, you know, I think it's good that--we need more Congressman Budds educated and educating to have people understand the different use cases and how these should be regulated. </p><p>BRUMMER: Only because it's--it's brought up, Mark--Mark Zu--Zuckerberg. And I--I--one of the issues that--that have--that's come up lately is you do have some members of the Libra association, which was the governing body--which will be the governing body for the--for the Libra system. So, folks have--have opted out of that--that--that system. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I read that. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and--I'm sure. I'm sure you probably did. You may have seen it. And when asked--and I'm paraphrasing, but when asked this morning, Mr. Zuckerberg had responded by saying, well, you know, they--they--they noticed that getting involved is--is--is risky. </p><p>You know, if--if part of the--the job or part of your business is--is building a market infrastructure and--and one that--that is working with legacy financial institutions, right, like, part of that is letting them know exactly what you do. And--and crypto is--is--is very new. And, you know, on--on the market side and on the regulatory side, there's just a--a--a--a ton of un--uncertainty. </p><p>What--you had a--at the end of--of our conversation with--with Clayton, one of your--your--your big XRP advocates had asked there--with hand raised had--had--had asked the--the chairman to make declaratory sort of statements about the--about XRP and its status as--as--as a security or not. But, I'm--I'm interested in how companies--cryptocompanies, crypto firms just more--more generally also navigate un--un--uncertainty, right? And--and particularly this question of--of--of regulatory un--uncertainty. </p><p>As I'd mentioned with--with the chairman, more than a couple of--not--not just sort of sponsors of crypto projects, but also market infrastructure providers have, you know, either commented on or clamored for un--un--more--more clarity. So, how exactly--you know, from--from your seat as--as a CEO, how do you navigate and do your job, you know, in a world of uncertainty in terms of the regulation of--of--of your pro--of one of--or at least of--of XRP, a part that you're dealing in--in or at least involved in? And also, just the infrastructure providers who are looking for clarity them--them--themselves. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. I--I mean, look, I--I think I will borrow a--a comment that Commissioner Peirce--Assessor Peirce made, which I think--I found to be very amusing and instructive. You know, her description--the--the SEC, as many people know, published a--a new updated framework to, I--I guess, a next generation Howey test, which had a whole bunch of information on there. And she commented that seemed about as clear as a Jackson Pollock painting. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And I--I would generally agree with that. And to, Chris, your question, I think, look, anybody in this room who's an entrepreneur, whether you're dealing with digital assets or you're dealing with, you know, whatever it is, there's always uncertainty. You're dealing with something new. You're building something new. </p><p>And I--I think that the plight of any entrepreneurial dream, the plight of any entrepreneur is to, you know, look at the spectrum of uncertainties and figure out what do you know to be true and then what do you--you can't know to be true and then charter a path forward. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: You know, I don't know who said it, but a--a--an entrepreneur who is quoted often in Silicon Valley is if--if you're trying to predict the future, the best thing to do is to create it. I think in a world of uncertainty, the best thing to do is to charge ahead. And, you know, I certainly recognize that the SEC made a decision to declaratively say that Bitcoin's not a security, then ether's not a security. Then, they have, for about 18 months, stopped. </p><p>So, you know, look, I mean, should we stop? No. You know, we--we--we got to keep going. We're building a business. We're fortunate to have more and more people participating as customers of Ripple. We have more and more companies taking advantage of the efficiency of the XRP ledger. </p><p>It's fa--you know, again, I--I'm long on Bitcoin. I am not bearish on Bitcoin. But, I think it--Bitcoin, given its cost per transaction and its speed of transaction, which is quite slow, it's not going to solve a payments problem. You know, Satoshi's white paper may have described it as a payments network, but, look, if each transaction of Bitcoin ledger cost about $1.80 and takes about 10 minutes, you know, if you're going to use Bitcoin to buy your coffee, by the time you get your coffee--well, first, it's going to double the price of the coffee. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Or, at a--actually, Starbucks is more than that. But, it's not--it's still going to add to the price. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: And by the time you get it, it's going to be 10 minutes of cooling off, which doesn't make sense. By comparison, XRP transaction's about 1,000 times cheaper per transaction and 1,000 times faster per transaction. I think that's why a lot of people are starting to use the XRP ledger for things that they had previously used Bitcoin for or perhaps even ether. You're seeing some of the scalability challenges there. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well--well, we were going to have Mr. Nakamoto, but we couldn't find him. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: He's here. Or, she is here. </p><p>BRUMMER: Like--but--but--but, just as a--as a brief aside, because you did say that you were also, you know, bullish on--on--on--on Bitcoin--you know, again, getting back to one of those sort of spectrum questions to again sort of highlight, you know, the--the different use cases for the Bitcoin versus Ripple. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: XRP. </p><p>BRUMMER: XRP. Where you have this idea of do you want to use, you know, a bridge currency for an international transaction, but you have decided to sort of focus--what--what--what--I--XRP is interesting because, as a bridge currency, it--it's not supposed to be used for things like buying coffee, right? Like, and--and--and-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Well-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --And--and--and I guess the asper-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --You--you--you say supposed to, my--my attitude is, like, XRP is an open source technology. Somebody in this room should--could or maybe is working on some incredibly cool XRP use case for consumers and I say Godspeed. I'm saying what Ripple is doing--your--my viewpoint is the challenge of dislocating fiat currency in the G20-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Yeah-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Like, that--that's not what Ripple's focused on. </p><p>BRUMMER: Mm-hmm. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Do I think there are--there are entrepreneurs--I mean, you know, BitPay, which is, like, kind of the leading crypto stripe, if you will, is going to be supporting XRP. And I think that's great. I think--you know, when I think about really getting mass scale, I don't think replacing the dollar at Starbucks down the street is going to happen any time soon. </p><p>BRUMMER: So--so, how do you go to the decision for--for Ripple as to what its business strategy is going to be, right, because-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Well, that's a good question. </p><p>BRUMMER: You--you--you know, because then, the--the--the--the universe of different sort of business strategies must've been--you know, I mean--I mean, even a couple of years ago, it was still pretty considerable. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Broad. Yeah. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and--and so, how did you then focus, you know, on--on--on--on the cross border problem? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: So, if--if I have a piece of advice for entrepreneurs building in the blockchain space, the number one piece of advice I have is to focus. I think there are so many different interesting applications for how you can apply blockchain technologies to increase efficiency of transactions. Any--any industry that has a middle man you can use a blockchain to arguably-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --That's right-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Eliminate that middle man and reduce friction in terms of cost, speed, what have you. So, that means there's a lot of industries. And I think one of the mistakes that some in the industry have made is they go super broad and not very deep. </p><p>Ripple has done the opposite. We have gone extremely deep in how we can use our technologies, how we can use the XRP open source ledger to solve a banking liquidity problem, and it's going really, really, really well. </p><p>We have a--we've announced well over 200 customers. Some of the largest banks in the world are customers. You know, I remember not 18 months ago, there was a New York Times reporter who said that, you know, no one's ever going to use XRP for liquidity. Guess what? You know, the--we are far from that. You know, I got into this Twitter war with him about it, which caused-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --That's always good-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --The PR team got very upset with me. They're around here. Sorry. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRUMMER: You know, which--it's--it's just fascinating, right, because folks both--both on the Hill, tech, academics, this question of--of the use case sort of permeates all of--all of crypto. And--and it's--it's--it's unusual where you can sort of see live examples sort of on the ground be--beyond, as you mentioned, sort of white paper phase. Could you take a second--and--and this is something slightly of an academic--because I am an academic--sort of question. </p><p>When you look at the--the--the ecosystem and--and also when you look at how you're trying to drive sort of Ripple as--as a business entity, like, how do you look at organizations like--like SWIFT? Because when I look at Ripple, I can't ever really tell--you know, on the one hand, like, oh, wow, these guys are kind of going after SWIFT. That's--that's--that's--that's pretty ambitious. But, then, I can also see kind of ways in which there's--there's cooperation and--and you can see some kind of potential collab--collaborations. </p><p>I mean, how is it--what do you think about SWIFT? What--what does your business model sort of look like when you think of an entity like SWIFT and you're really swinging for very, you know, big targets. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Look, I'm--I'm somewhat sympathetic to the plight that SWIFT has. You know, this is a technology framework developed four or five decades ago that really has not evolved to keep up with, you know, technologies--internet based technologies. And one of the challenges they have is it's not a traditionally corporate run structure. I mean, yes, there's a CEO, but it's more of a consortium, a cooperative. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: And you don't have kind of shareholders in a traditional sense. And so, sometimes decision making isn't--it's driven more by, you know, what do the existing cooperative members want to see happen. </p><p>And you know, I--I have compared SWIFT. It's a little bit like if I decided I was going to send you a postcard, I'd write, Chris, put your address on it, stick it in a mailbox. I have no idea what happens after I stick it in the mailbox. Matter of fact, I don't even know if you got it. The only way I know you got it is because you send me a text or send me, hey, it's a nice postcard, whatever. </p><p>I mean, that actually is how SWIFT kind of works today. You send a SWIFT transaction--SWIFT message out there. You don't know if the person--other than someone telling you they received the funds via email or phone or what have you, you don't even know if they got the money. </p><p>I--I think that, look, the--we have moved into a world where we expect the ability--up here on stage, I could go to Door Dash and--or whatever the local one is in Washington, D.C. and probably get ice cream delivered to me before the 20 minutes is up on the screen up here. Sorry you guys can't see that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know, that's a crazy real-time world. Yet, in a--you know, many people have heard me say, it's crazy to me that the fastest way to get money from Washington to London today is to drive to Dulles and fly it there. And that's just, you know, not--that--that's very surprising in 2019 in a world where we--the internet, as we know it today, is very real-time. And I--I think what--at its core, what Ripple is trying to do is to stitch together disparate inoperable--non-interoperable networks for interoperability. </p><p>The other one--there might be somebody here from PayPal, which I apologize in advance. But, look, I--I'm a PayPal customer. I'm a Venmo customer. They're owned by PayPal. If I want to move funds from PayPal to Venmo, go read the FAQs and it describes how you move PayPal money back to your bank and from bank back to Venmo. Like, if that's not the definition of non-interoperable networks by one company, you know, the--but, that's the state of payment networks on planet earth today. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well--well, what do you--or how do you view stablecoins? I mean, because these are also other kinds of solutions that are--that--that people are trying to think through. Many are still, you know, in their white paper stage. I--I guess it's anyone's sort of--there's debate as to whether or not Libras would--would--would have constituted a--a--a real stablecoin or not. It--it sounds like, from what I've heard on the Hill, they--they may be rethinking how they want to operationalize, you know, their--their basket and whether or not they want to have a basket of different currencies. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Well, if it's a basket, it's really an ETF, right? </p><p>BRUMMER: And it is an ETF. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: If--if--if I were Chairman Clayton and I were looking at Libra's first definition of what it was going to be, it would be regulated as an ETF. </p><p>BRUMMER: Right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: It's a basket of currencies that you can buy through one vehicle. That's--that's an ETF. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well--well, certainly some of the terminology that was used very closely resembles the kind of terminology that--that--that you see in an ETF. Do you view--like, how do you view stablecoins? How do you think that stablecoins will impact your--your--your business? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: So, the--the good thing is a stablecoin of the U.S.  dollar, a stablecoin of fill in the blank still needs to drive interoperability to another--across another network into another currency. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yes, sir. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: And so, when--and again, I go back to, like, we're trying to enable friction--as low friction as possible as fast as possible interoperability between these various networks, between these various currencies. And in that context, we think the liquidity of the XRP ledger, the XRP, you know, market allows that to happen extremely efficiently. I think it's interesting to see what's happening to stablecoins. I think in some ways they've exceeded where I thought they were going to be. </p><p>But, to be clear, I think stablecoins are here to stay. I think there are going to be more and more of them. And, you know, I--I--I'm in--intrigued by those that are launching new stablecoins. </p><p>BRUMMER: Have they--have they performed better than you would-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Yes. </p><p>BRUMMER: You-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Yeah. I thought originally when the first stablecoins were being announced, I didn't--I feel like I kind of was, like, this might be just a passing fancy. And I think I was wrong about that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, when you look at, you know, the--the valuation of--of cryptocurrencies--there were some people in--in the au--in the audience. We had, like, a collection and--and a book coming from last year's fintech week where one of the chapters tried to think through the valuation of--of a cryptocurrency. </p><p>Number one, what do you think XRP is--is--is--is worth? And then B, how do you, you know--I mean, you said you hold a lot of it. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, you know, what--what do you think the--the--it's--it's--it's actually worth? And, you know, just in general-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Can I look at my phone? I'll tell you what it's actually worth. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I think-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Not the market value. We're going with the real value here. You know, and then--and then--and then, secondly, you know, how easy or hard do you think it is to--to, you know, put a value or price on--on, you know, some of the more established cryptocurrencies generally? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Look, the--the only thing I know for sure is the total market capital of all crypto is somewhere around 250 billion. I think today Bitcoin's dominance of that is, like, 65 percent. I--I--it is a, I think, kind of a fool's errand to predict where is that going to be higher or lower tomorrow? You know, if I understood what's driving the crypto markets on a day to day basis, I probably wouldn't be sitting here. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I--you know, I-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --That's great. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: It's--it's a mystery to me. There's days when Bitcoin goes up that I'm, like, wow, that--that--that seems like there's very positive macro dynamics unfolding and then, Bitcoin goes down. I don't--you know, I--I think over the long haul--well, there's a famous Warren Buffet saying that in the short term, the markets are a--a voting machine. In the long-term, they're a weighing machine. </p><p>I don't know how long the long-term is in--in the crypto markets. I don't spend a lot of time getting wrapped up in what's happening in the crypto markets over three days or three weeks or even three months. </p><p>BRUMMER: You--speculation is and--and continues to be a driver in lots of the--the--the cryptocurrency markets more generally. When you think about the question of--of creating a use case specifically for any cryptocurrency, you have to, especially when that cryptocurrency is--is--is trading on a market, you know, the--the--it--it creates, I would assume, certain kinds of just practical questions when you're trying to, again, engage with some of your legacy infrastructure providers. </p><p>What does the volatility--how is the volatility of XRP--XRP impacted anyone who's operating in the ecosystem and trying to do something with it? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: So, one of our products as I was describing earlier with, you know, the MoneyGram example, the Bank of Chris going from dollars to pesos and I was describing you use XRP as a--kind of a shuttle, a bridge currency. You know, people often ask, like, wait a minute, I--I could never use that because the volatility of the digital asset in XRP could, you know, obviate--could--could mean that the transaction's not profitable if I'm, you know, selling that to an end user. </p><p>And I--I think this is a red herring issue. This is not a real issue with XRP. It's a real issue with slow transaction time digital assets. But, here--you know, somebody in this room, I'm sure, is more of a math quant than I am and, you know, you can correct me on the details here. But, volatility measurement is both a measure of volatility and duration. </p><p>And so, if you take a SWIFT transaction and a SWIFT transaction--let's say, on average, it's a three day settlement time, that's about 260,000 seconds. Bear with me on that. I did the math. So, if you take a low volatile asset, like a fiat currency, over a long arc of time and you compare that to a highly volatile asset, like XRP, but an XRP transaction is about between three and four seconds. So, you have a high volatile asset over three or four seconds and you have a low volatile asset over 260,000 seconds, it turns out there's more volatility risk in the SWIFT fiat transaction. That's just math. </p><p>Now, what happens, though, when you're doing a SWIFT transaction is someone is selling you to hedge that transaction. They're saying I will settle that transaction in three day's time at this price. </p><p>BRUMMER: Right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: But, I'm selling that to you. That's part of the price of the transaction. Now, you don't really need somebody to hedge the value in a three second transaction. Now, by the way, if you do need someone to, eventually the marketplace will create that--someone will enter that and--and they will provide that. </p><p>BRUMMER: And we're seeing that. Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Now, I don't think an XRP--I'm not sure it's ever needed in an XRP because it's so fast. Like, why do you need it? </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, that's what I was--I was about to ask. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: In Bitcoin, maybe--you know, look, if you want to use Bitcoin for payments and you said, well, the average transaction time is 10 minutes and you said, look, there's been times when the price of Bitcoin's gone up 2 percent or down 2 percent in 10 minutes--by the way, I don't know if that's the case. I don't-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Right. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Somebody smarter than me. Then, you might have some--some market maker saying, I'll--I'll hedge that for you. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, I think--I think--this is just--I mean, I don't want to get too far off, but it's--it's--this is a really interesting point. I mean, you know, you are seeing the finan--financialization, if one will, of--of--of certain cryptocurrencies. Futures contracts for--for Bitcoin. </p><p>We had Heath Tarbert, the chairman of CFTC, at--for FinTech week on--on Monday and he was talking about forward--or--or futures contracts within the next six months for--for--for Ethereum, you know? And--and--and that is an interesting sort of just general question. If one was to create sort of this--this larger hedging or derivatives market for something like XRP, you know--which is weird because you have all these other actors who may not have a direct financial interest sort of--or--or--or stake, you know, how does that speak to speculation and/or, you know, a tradeoff of just making people's lives a little bit more challenging when you're trying to--to navigate and build products off of a--you know, a platform or--or using a--a particular digital asset. </p><p>So, good luck with that if that comes-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>comes--comes your--your--your way. So--so, just a couple of questions. Since you're here in D.C., you have an opportunity. Literally, we have a--oh. They're saying I--someone's telling me to ask Q&amp;A. Okay. That's fine. They're-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --We're opening it up. </p><p>BRUMMER: We will--we will open it up for--for questions. </p><p>QUESTION: Brad, thanks for being here with us today. This is a real easy question for you. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I love the easy questions. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>QUESTION: You might not love this one. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Uh-oh. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>QUESTION: But, I'd pay all my XRP to have you answer it. Maybe not. Not really. With Ripple focused on providing on-demand liquidity and the world facing what's probably the biggest liquidity crisis ever, what role do you see XRP and XRP ledger and similar technologies playing in alleviating such a crisis? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Well, so, if you think about, like, what causes those kinds of crises, I--one of the dynamics--and by the way, there's lots of inputs into a crisis like that. One of them is friction. One of them is time. If you can reduce friction, as measured by time and cost, that's good. That's just a--a good thing to minimizing, you know, the--the--the--the risks of liquidity issues. </p><p>You know, look, I--I--I don't pretend that XRP is a panacea for all of these issues. What I do believe is if we can successfully integrate into the existing system, we're going to more rapidly bring the benefits of these technologies to a much, much, much broader audience than if we try to circumvent the system. </p><p>So, I--I--I've been incredibly pleased by the engagement we've had, you know, ranging from the IMF to, you know, central banks. And, you know, look, Ripple's going to continue to work with those players. That's part of the reason why we made the announcements we made this week about expanding or really creating our presence more concretely here in Washington, DC. And I'm--I'm optimistic that if these technologies continue to propagate across corresponding banking but other industries, that's going to be good for any liquidity crisis. </p><p>BRUMMER: Linda. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. </p><p>BRUMMER: Former Federal Reserve. </p><p>QUESTION: So, congratulations on your 400 new customers. And I want to find out what is the current volumes of payments going through Ripple right now amongst your bank customers? </p><p>And also, my background's in bank regulation. So, I'm trying to understand how Ripple works with banking activities. If--depending on how the SEC comes out whether XRP is determined to be a security or if not, then it would have to be, most likely, an intangible asset. Then, it would have to be deducted from Basel capital requirements. How does this all work with your banking customers when they use your services? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I--I missed that very, very last part of the question. How does this all work with what? </p><p>QUESTION: For your banking customers-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Banking customers, yeah-- </p><p>QUESTION: --When they use your services. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: So, look, there are a few different questions embed in there. I'll--I'll start with I think the kind of--the--the big elephant in the room given how Chairman Clayton's question ended earlier. Look, I believe--I, Brad Garlinghouse, believe it's very clear that XRP's not a security. I think there's a whole bunch of reasons for that. I--I--you know, one of them, quite frankly, is in the hypothetical world, Ripple could shut down, literally. I could fly back to California, send everybody home tomorrow, and there's 140 exchanges around the world that trade XRP and XRP's going to continue trading. </p><p>Now, do I think it's great that if one major player in the XRP ecosystem isn't playing? Yeah, that's not great. However, I think--and I--I was actually trying to pull some data on this this morning and I didn't get it. I think coil is doing more XRP transactions per day right now than Ripple is. And the reason is that the coil transactions are micro transactions. They're very, very, very, very small payments. And so, the volume is, you know, much higher. </p><p>So, look, I--I think the SEC is trying to think through not just for XRP, but a whole bunch of different digital assets, how should we think about these things? I don't pretend it's a simple issue. I think the--the good news is I think that's a constructive conversation. And, you know, I--I--I'm not losing a lot of sleep that our customers aren't going to get--be able to continue to use XRP to--for liquidity based upon, you know, the--the SEC doing something. </p><p>The other part of your question I think was around volume. Look, one of the things--people ask us a lot about volume. And I--one of the things I want this audience to understand, banks don't want me to tell you exactly what their volumes are going. That's a private thing for them. We have shared on--an aggregate. You know, last year, we ended up in the many tens of thousands of transactions. We're growing those transactions to the tune of 10X year over year, kind of doubling almost every quarter. </p><p>So, there's two dynamics that happen there, by the way. We're adding new banks, new financial institutions to the network and that's good because that means there's more members. And they add volume. But, then, there's also more nodes on the network. So, if you are a bank--you know, I hypothetically describe Santander. </p><p>Santander is one of our major customers. They might've gone live with two corridors. And then, next year--you know, next quarter, they add two other corridors and two other currency pairs. And so, you have this exponential kind of growth because you're not just adding new banks and new financial institutions to the network, but they're adding more and more corridors. I mean, even MoneyGram, which has been quite public about their work with us, you know--I got a call from the CEO. I probably shouldn't say this. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I got a-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Please, do. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I got a call from the CEO of MoneyGram two weeks ago and, you know, he's upset with us because we're not moving fast enough. That was an unbelievable, like--that--you don't have a lot of that happen. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: And, you know, look, I--he wants us to launch on demand liquidity, formerly known as xRapid in more markets more quickly because the--they're having such a good experience with Mexico that they're, like, look, we want to be able to spread this more quickly, more aggressively. So, that's great. But, we're not going to launch new markets until we've engaged regulators in those markets, we know that--exchanges on the other end are robust and compliant and all the things that go with that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Another question. Yes. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Jade. </p><p>QUESTION: Yes. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I met you earlier. </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, you did. Thank you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Good afternoon, everyone. So, I know Ripple is expanding and hiring massively through just the people that's been experience in government relation or maybe just in engineering. But, what advice could you give just the students, such as myself, and who are--are not really blockchain experience but want to be able to get involved in this new asset class and just who are hungry and passionate just for the revelation? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. Look, I--I mean, one of the things that Ripple--so, we are about 400 employees now. And, you know, you--if--if I see an employee at Ripple post a job description that says, hey, we want somebody that has 10 years of experience in this industry, you're like, wait a minute, this industry didn't exist 10 years ago. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, the good news you have is you're not competing with somebody who has years and years experience in crypto because the industry is still new. I--I--I guess the best advice I have as you're thinking about getting into this industry is don't worry about what your job is on day one. You just want to be in the door. </p><p>I mean, I can already look at employees who joined Ripple two or three years ago and we've been fortunate because we're growing a lot. But, they started doing X and now, they have been promoted twice and they're doing something totally different because they are ambitious, they're smart, they're hardworking. </p><p>And, you know--so, my advice to some degree is, like, don't worry about how to get in the door. Just get in the door. And, you know, if you--if you learn a skill set around this industry, betting the next 10 or 15 or 20 years of your career on blockchain, regardless of where you start, I think is a good bet. </p><p>And so, when I talk to, you know, young students who are thinking about, you know, which industry they want to bet on, when I came out of business school in 1997, I made a bet that the internet was an interesting space to do that. You know, now, four or five years ago, I made a bet that, look, I think blockchain is here to stay. I think it's going to continue to grow and affect more and more industries. And so, I--I think, you know if you're a student in this space at all, I think dive in with both feet or jump--whatever. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Don't dive. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, yeah. And--and that's a--a--I can't--I--I talk so often to some of my colleagues at the European Commission, I can't remember if I came up with it or--or--or--or some of them. You know, what do you call--you know, what will people be calling fintech five years now? And the answer, finance, you know? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and--but, to get to--to some of the changes, we also have in the audience--I--I--I see the former general counsel for the IMF and you're mentioning them. And, you know, you do have not only a proliferation of sort of stablecoins and new kinds of private sort of currency options or--or--or--but, you also have central banks getting much more actively involved in the digital asset space. And we had a conversation a little bit about that earlier, especially earlier in--in--in the week where we had the heads of fintech from some of the central banks who are sort of toying with different variations of an idea of central bank digital currencies. </p><p>I mean, what--what does that do to your--to--to your business? And how does that shape and impact sort of the--the cryptocurrency space more--more--more generally? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Well--well, look, I think central bank issued digital assets are analogous to stablecoins, but, obviously, issued by the central bank. The--the thing that's confusing for me--and--and I--well, I--I know there was at least one person here earlier from the fed that if--if I'm a bank and I go to--and I have access to and I go to the fed window today for liquidity, I'm not getting a crate of dollars. I'm--I'm--that's--I'm getting a--a ledger entry, a dig--a digital ledger entry. And so, it's a little bit confusing to me. </p><p>You know, there's been a lot of attention, I think--the testimony from Mark Zuckerberg today is, you know, talking in part about what's happening in China and the apparent intended launch of a central bank digital asset in China representing the RMB. What I don't know--I don't know how that--China works in this regard. I know enough about the U.S.  to be dangerous. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But, I don't really understand if--if the fed window is giving me digitized dollars already, what's the difference between issuing a digitized dollar versus iss--issuing a dig--a digital token representing a dollar? It's--you know, I've also made the same point about the JPM coin. I'm sure there's somebody here from JP Morgan. </p><p>BRUMMER: Probably. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I'm just going to offend as many people as I can. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, you know, the JPM coin--the only way you get a JPM coin is if you deposit a dollar into your JP Morgan account. And you can only use the JPM coin intra-JPM. How is that different than a JPM dollar? Like, I don't--I don't get what the J--why we had to tokenize the JPM coin. </p><p>You know, anyway, there's things like that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Which is--which is interesting because, like, I--as far as I understand from some of the--there are conversations when people are thinking about the--this--this--for Libra, what--are you an ETF? Well, okay. If we remove the ba--the currencies from the basket and we just make it into a--a--sort of a purely dollar based basket, then you just get into the question of are--are you just merely digitizing the--the dollar for--for that particular network? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Can I say one other--on--on Libra just because you brought it up. I mean, you didn't ask this question, but I'm just going-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --No. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I'm just going to go. Look, I--I--I think a lot of people assume that I and Ripple are anti-Libra. I'm actually not anti-Libra at all. I--I think it's not competitive with what Ripple's doing and I kind of view it as well, if--if Libra is going to be kind of a--a new payment network, well, it's going to need to be interoperable with other networks. And so, that's what Ripple wants to do. So, hey, Godspeed. </p><p>The reason why I think people perceive me as being anti-Libra is because, one, I think that they have gone out into the marketplace in a way that was not good for crypto because--I mean, it was after Libra was announced that the president of the United States tweets out, like, I don't like cryptocurrencies. It's, like, oh, shit, you know? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know, look-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --I'm sure it was a good day. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Look, I--I think what--what Libra and maybe Facebook got wrong is that any financial service--the foundation of any financial service is trust. It's trust. Facebook, by their own acknowledgement in today's testimony, they have a deficit on trust. We can debate is that fair or unfair or how we got here, but the reality is that's where we are. </p><p>And so, for me, when I saw Facebook leading the effort around the face for the Libra White Paper, I thought, you know, look, had it--had it--PayPal was part of the initial Libra. They must've stepped out. But, had Libra announced--sorry--PayPal announced Libra and not Facebook-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Oh, well, that-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --PayPal announce it and then Facebook joined, wouldn't that be a different world right now? And by the way, maybe Libra is a fabulous thing and we want it to succeed. But, I think Facebook, you know, almost, frankly, an arrogant way decided we want to be on point here. We're going to lead it. And I think they didn't understand the trust deficit they had in the--in--with government, particularly. I see another question out there. Sorry. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yes. One--one--one last question. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Fletcher McCraw with Cognizant. I lead our partnerships in blockchain space. And I'm curious of your approach around the different networks that are forming. Obviously, Ripple is forming in network. There are competitors out there, like the IN and Swiss Exploring. And there's also complementary networks. Maybe things like, you know, TradeIX and We Trade, Marco Polo particularly in the trade finance space since that's very international. </p><p>So, how do you--how do you view strategically some of the competitive networks they're trying to form versus some of the complementary networks and where both fits in. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: First of all, I'll tell you upfront. I mean, he mentioned a handful of networks I've never heard of. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I--I--you know, my--my reaction any k me about kind of competitive networks, I mean, we're trying to create interoperability between time people as networks. We call that Ripple Net. I don't view that as a closed network. Meaning, you know, it isn't--I don't view myself as competitive. PayPal or Alipay or Paytm or fill in blank. </p><p>I think about it as, like, how do we become the TCPIP of an internet of value? You know, our--our whole mission, you know, that you--if you look at internally at Ripple, you know, our--our vision for the company is to enable value to move the way information moves today. </p><p>And so, when I think about these different networks, what I'm thinking to myself and when I hear some of those that I hadn't heard of, what I'm thinking to myself is, okay. Wouldn't it be great if all of them were interoperable? Wouldn't it be great if, you know, a--a--a gentleman here in DC whose mom lives in Mumbai and has a Paytm digital wallet but the gentleman here in D.C. is on BAML. You know, if you want to send $50 from your BAML account to your mom on Mother's Day in India, good luck. </p><p>Like, if--if you get any money there, it won't be $50. It'll be a whole lot less. But, you know, if those are just two interoperable nodes connected through a common framework around technologies, like, why--why isn't that super simple? The vision we see using XRP as that bridge asset is extremely fast and extremely inexpensively, you're shuttling that value from a BAML account to a Paytm account. No big deal. </p><p>BRUMMER: Only because it's 45 seconds, but I see the European Commission has a--has their hand up, speak really fast. </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) Could you speak a little bit as to how do you actually make money yourself in this? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: How does Ripple make profit or not a profit? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: You know, the--I said upfront at the most basic level, we're an enterprise software company. We sell software to banks. So, you know, typically when we sign a contract with one of these players, you know, there's software licensing fees, there's transaction fees, there's professional services fees. </p><p>We also own a lot of XRP. That is a--an asset we own in the same way, you know, look, Exxon owns a lot of oil. Exxon's selling some of that oil and making money from doing that. </p><p>So, we--we think about both of those-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --How much do you own--how--how much XRP do you own? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: We own about 55 or 50--I don't know the exact math. </p><p>BRUMMER: Okay. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Fifty six percent, plus or minus of-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --All XRP is owned by Ripple. </p><p>BRUMMER: Okay. We have to end it. Oh. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: All right. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah. We-- </p><p>QUESTION: --Real quick. No, real quick. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Oh, they turned off the mic. </p><p>BRUMMER: They did turn off the mic. Okay. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We are efficient. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I'll repeat the question. </p><p>BRUMMER: We are an efficient system. </p><p>QUESTION: I'll repeat the question. So, do you ever see Ripple--do you ever see Ripple standing out as a standalone currency other than just a mechanism to transfer fee out currency $50 to Mumbai? Can it stand alone? </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Can it stand alone? I don't under-- </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Can XRP stand alone? </p><p>QUESTION: Talk about transferring value to Mumbai. It's always tied to a fiat currency. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. Oh, right. </p><p>QUESTION: So, it's a transfer mechanism. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Yeah. Do I see-- </p><p>QUESTION: --Are we always going to be tied to fiat currency? </p><p>BRUMMER: Transforming from bridge to currency. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Well, look, for the foreseeable future, my viewpoint is fiat currencies and G20 markets serve the consumer use case very effectively. Why am I going to try to disrupt the rupee? </p><p>QUESTION: So, you just want to be a transfer mechanism. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: What Ripple is focused on right now is to be infrastructure for banks or financial institutions to shuttle value. We're not trying to place--replace any fiat currency. Now, as I said earlier, there may be somebody in this room who's using the open source technology of the XRP ledger and is trying to build a consumer remittance application-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Right-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --Through XRP. There's nothing that I can do about that. It's got-- </p><p>QUESTION: --So, you are not a threat to government structures. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: I am definitely not--yeah. When I go in and explain to ba--to central governments what we work--how we work, they're, like, okay. Good. </p><p>BRUMMER: Okay. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: We're going to get--I'm going to get the hook. </p><p>BRUMMER: This is--this is--this is literally the--the closest we've gotten-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --All right-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --To the hook. But--but-- </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: --We're out. </p><p>BRUMMER: But, let me just say, Brad, thank you so much for coming, man. </p><p>GARLINGHOUSE: Absolutely. Thank you. </p><p>BRUMMER: I appreciate the extra time. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>NOLAN: Yes. Thanks, Brad and Chris. I'm sorry. I am the bad guy. I was off stage. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, just real quick, we're going to do a 10 minute break. So, please, be back in your seats in 10 minutes. I'll do a two minute call before, but please make sure you're back in your seats so we can get started right away. Thank you very much. </p><p>LUBIN: The different kind of use cases for digital assets more--more generally because it's not just the question of a currency or it's not even a payment system it's a kind of programmable-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --Sure-- </p><p>LUBIN: --a system. </p><p>BRUMMER: And, maybe you could sort of walk folks very briefly through what distinguishes you from some of the--the major cryptocurrencies out there like a LIBRA and--and Bitcoin? </p><p>LUBIN: Yeah, so--so Bitcoin sometimes is called programmable money. The (AUDIO GAP) expressible or programmable system out there. When we proposed to build Ethereum a lot of people in the Bitcoin space said it was impossible. We weren't going to be able to build something that complex and keep all those notes all those different computers perfectly in sync, in consensus with one another. You know, the surface area was too big. It will just break over and over--come out to consensus. So--so we were able to define--define a very programmable system, a very powerful system and get it to work and keep it working for a very long time. And, it was sufficiently powerful so that we could experiment with this idea of building decentralized applications. A totally new paradigm experiment with the idea of wrapping companies around these decentralized applications and see if we can commercialize this new kind of decentralized world wide web. </p><p>And, we did our best to make it a scalable as possible. We weren't very focused on making it private and confidential. We were trying to make it work. Ethereum 1.0 has seen different scalability and confidentiality mechanisms but into it and on top of it. And we're--we can handle more use cases that way. And, we're seeing tremendous advances in scalability. So, the base layer can handle somewhere around 20 transactions per second depending on the kind of transaction. But we can anchor technology at layer two into layer one and get, in some cases, 10s of thousands of transactions per second. So we're--we're building out layer one already in terms of the weaknesses that it has had. We still need to--to buff out to beef it up. </p><p>So, Ethereum 2.0 is all about turning that base trust layer into something that is much, much more powerful. That will magnify all the gains made at layer two quite significantly. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's got to be quite a project, right? Because if you particularly if you want to maintain you know, depending on-on how much of a purist what is with regards to the integrity of your blockchain, you know, like how do you want to effectuate or operationalize that--that particular scalability? You know, on the one hand--are you looking--are you looking or considering forking or you're actually going to build? </p><p>LUBIN: No. So, Ethereum 2.0 is being built. There are nine teams, seven major teams nine--nine teams total that have been building it for a while. It's being built in three major phases. The first phase has seven teams in sync with one another coming in consensus with one another. And, it's looking like we're going to be able to launch that in Q1 of next year, so possibly January a very small number of--a very small number of months from now. So, that's the heartbeat of the system. That's the beacon chain, that's the proof of stake system. </p><p>It will run I--in parallel to Ethereum 1.0, which is a proof of work system we can talk about that if you want to. But essentially, like--like Microsoft releasing a new operating system or brand you know, a--a paradigm changing opera6ting system they keep the old one running. Lots of people keep using it and the more advanced software houses built for the new system because they want to take advantage of--of the next great features. And so, Ethereum 2.0 will get going very soon. And, the next two major phases are probably going to be released together because we have a team we actually have six teams working on Ethereum 2.0, but we have got a team that is building out the next two phases simultaneously and we're building it on the first phase. So, there's a decent chance in my opinion that Ethereum 2.0 will be functional before the end of 2020. </p><p>BRUMMER: So, you've moved from a proof of work system to a proof of stake system. And--and maybe you can sort of walk us through that and with some specificity outline sort of how you view you know, how a proof of stake system would operate? Earlier today we had some panels and some interesting debates about some of the pros and cons of both systems and you know, the degree to which either one is capable of scaling up. Maybe you can sort of speak to again, how you are thinking about the proof of stake system and that migration to a proof of stake system and how you judged the competing sort of interest in--in terms of how you design this--this new strategy? </p><p>LUBIN: So, it's a bit esoteric. Start--start with the basics. Essentially, it's a new kind of database technology. We trade a whole lot of scalability for trust. we get trust by having massive decentralization. Many, many computer nodes kept in sync by a consensus algorithm. All consensus algorithms everywhere and there are lots of different examples of these historically, elect a leader in some way and they have everybody else follow in behind the leader. A very energy consumptive and efficient way of electing a leader is by making all of the different computers solve a complex puzzle. And so, Bitcoin invented a decentralized way of electing a leader. And, can have the first really decentralized way in history. </p><p>And, unfortunately, it has become a very inefficient system. It burns an enormous amount of energy and wastes a lot of computation, requires specialized hardware. Way more security cost than is necessary. Proof of stake replaces all of that waste with a cryptoeconomic bond basically. So, if I have a bunch of Ether, I can stake it in a smart connect in a program on the blockchain and that gives me the right to validate transactions and blocks on this network. </p><p>If I behave badly, the software can come along and take away my security bond, essentially. And so, proof of stake is far less wasteful, far more efficient and it's actually more decentralized and more secure. It's more decentralized because the barrier to entry to participating is very low compared to proof of work. And, the efficiencies of scale don't exist. So, if I'm running a Chinese warehouse behind the great firewall, I have tremendous efficiencies of scale there. Messages moving across the firewall are disadvantaged. Messages in my own warehouse are advantaged and you don't get that sort of thing in a proof of stake system. Anybody can put up a not too big amount of ether and participate from probably an inexpensive computer. </p><p>BRUMMER: In terms of ensuring I'll--I'll try this way--when you think about once you move to a proof of stake system, there are questions about concentration of economic power. How does that compare to Bitcoin in terms of how you sort of view decision making on--on that blockchain? </p><p>LUBIN: So, as I said, you don't have efficiencies of scale drive some aspects of centralization and just access to the specialized hardware drives centralization. So Bitcoin turned into a hardware arms race basically. So, it's--unless you are able to access the latest hardware early it's actually not cost effective to mine Bitcoin. </p><p>BRUMMER: Looking forward we had Chairman Tarbert here on Monday. And I don't know, you may have heard some statements recently about--about Ethereum and Ether and he actually elaborated on those comments and was quite--was quite interesting. It made--in case you--you hadn't heard not only is did he sort of affirm that Ether is a commodity you know, there--thereby really sort of firmly making more concrete some statements that actually, I believe Bill Hinman(PH) and Chairman Clayton had made earlier. </p><p>And, also, said that within six months he believed that there could be even sort of futures contracts for Ether trade. What do you think about that particular financialization of--of--of Ether and--and how does that impact the way in which you do your--your--your business and you think about you know, an upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain? </p><p>LUBIN: Sure. So it makes perfect sense to me. It may not be a surprise that we said all those things a pretty long time ago. Essentially, we are seeing the IT industry on the planet transform. We used to have--we still sort of do--essentially large software companies who have heavy salesforces who do their business in a very clunky way and we are seeing the granularization of the delivery of software and software services. So software as a service in many different forms. We are also going to see a similar granularization of the hardware storage and bandwidth aspects of the IT industry where it is not just going to be devices on your desktop, it's going to be devices in your pocket, it's going to be devices in your clothing and the furniture, etcetera. </p><p>And so, we're moving into a world where this smart contract infrastructure sitting on blockchain networks is going to enable us to negotiate for provision and pay for software resources and hardware resources and storage computer and bandwidth. And so, tokenization is going to enable me to provision and pay in real time I may want to get some sort of job done a couple years now--I'll talk to Siri on my phone. I'll ask her to--to run some sort of machine learning she may be able to do some of it on the phone and she'll call some AWS server and--and maybe there will be some stuff that we can do on this table here that has (INAUDIBLE) computation. </p><p>So, all that's going to get very real time and very granular. And, we're going to have all these collaboration networks so that each of us spend some of our time, attention, resources in helping to compute or--or to just participate in these different collaboration networks for work and for leisure. </p><p>And, we're putting up our resources and we will expect to some sort of compensation for that. What we will need as we move the whole IT infrastructure into this granular ecosystem that looks more like the energy ecosystem or the metals ecosystem, we're going to need financial instruments that enable us to manage our risks. So our pricing risks, etcetera, etcetera. So futures and options are going to be absolutely necessary as we provide services to those networks. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's actually quite helpful cause you know what just the more you grow you know there is one thing when it come sot developing new kinds of apps and--and your developer count and even getting some of those products to market and our last panel for days was--was Wall Street one and we have regulators and folks thinking about sort of monetization questions. </p><p>But you know, when you get to financialization--financialization does also introduce all kinds of other actors who have different sort of more indirect interests sort of in--in the marketplace and it's always curious to see to a degree that's greeted or is a little bit more skepticism. </p><p>I know that at one point you had mentioned I--I had read that the active developer count was over 200,000 folks. </p><p>LUBIN: Estimate. </p><p>BRUMMER: Estimate. You know, when do you think that you'll see some of those products or to live products coming--coming to market? When you look at the build out of the ecosystem and--and you see that that network and that ecosystem growing? </p><p>LUBIN: We do have live products. </p><p>BRUMMER: Sorry. </p><p>LUBIN: So, we are a young ecosystem with not very mature technology right now and so the \"shrink wrapped\" products are--are not very mature. We spend a lot of our time using the Ethereum technology that we built for enterprises and governments and banks and central banks. We spend even more of our attention on building out the public Ethereum main (INAUDIBLE) ecosystem. And so, we actually see through the infrastructure that--that our company consensus is built we see days where there are 10 billion queries coming from our ecosystem. So we are building out better wallet systems. We are building out system in the music industry and in journalism and decentralized finance as I said before, it's really exploding. </p><p>We need--so we've got the early stages of this base trust foundation for the planet. And upon that we are building settlement layer. Upon that we are building decentralized finance. I think of it as financial plumbing for the emerging digital economy and once that gets really flushed out and it's moving incredibly quickly--there is composability in that layer so that all these different products or protocols can talk to one another. </p><p>You got wallets talking to the lending systems that are talking to a lottery system. So it's really interesting. Once we have that more and more usable with greater liquidity than more industries can start building on top of that. </p><p>BRUMMER: So, I'm about to turn it to the audience but we are in Washington. We are in the world of regulation. And certainly, we've seen Charlie Tarbard(PH) and others sort of more firmly identify the legal status of--of--of Ether. But you're still operating--I think if you're anybody operating in the digital asset space there is always some legacy of uncertainty out there right? You are dealing with other entities and even though you might be certain as to what you are--you may not necessarily be entirely certain as to how they will be sort of regulated, particularly when you get into DeFi and you get sort of the financial sort of infrastructure space. From your--from your chair you--you know how--it's a question I asked Bradley--how do you navigate, how do you continue to navigate just regulatory un--uncertainty and are there things that when you come to Washington and you talk to policy maker sis there anything that--that you would I mean everyone would like to see more--more clearly--but specifically any kinds of either suggestions or ideas that you think could be useful in--in generating more certainly for that ecosystem to evolve? </p><p>LUBIN: So, we have been paying attention to regulatory issues since the start of Ethereum project. I personally delayed the launch of Ethereum crowd sale by a number of months until we felt like we had significant comfort from a prestigious law firm. At consensus we started the Brooklyn Project, which is a project--so, we got a great group of lawyers at consensus one of them might be out there right now. And, we have brought academics and regulators in the industry together for lot of conversations. We have been very careful when we've issued tokens. I believe we've done a good job staying on the right side of the securities act. </p><p>And, we are comfortable that we can issue both tokenized securities in a regulatorily complement way as well as utility tokens. It's a powerful new technology and e--essentially we need to have lots of dialogues within society, within different jurisdictions because certain thing swill be acceptable to some jurisdictions and not in others. We need to figure out how we want to see this technology used in society. So, it's should not be about regulating the technology itself. It should be about regulating the use of the technology. E--essentially TCIP IP is an agnostic technology or it's a technology that can be used for virtually anything. And the internet at a certain layer I--is largely unregulated. It's what companies and people in different jurisdictions have been doing with it that starts people having those discussions and making rules about that. </p><p>I feel like Ethereum and related technologies are incredibly powerful and we will probably want a permissionless layer at the base. That'll be the base trust layer. But on top of that there will be lots of notified entities that transact according to the laws of their jurisdictions. </p><p>BRUMMER: Excellent. OK. Hands. There is a gentleman right next to you and then afterwards we will come up to the front. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah, I was wondering-- </p><p>BRUMMER: And, feel free to identify yourself. </p><p>QUESTION: My name is Matthew. I'm a web developer. I was wondering what sort of advice you have for web developers and entrepreneurs within this space? </p><p>BRUMMER: How do you get started in build an--an Ethereum blockchain (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>LUBIN: There's a lot of information on the internet. So, I--I feel like a web too, has tremendous capabilities in technology. But in some cases, in many cases it sort of veered off in concerning directions. The internet was sort of advertised as a--as a decentralized network a while ago and because of efficiencies, because of essentially the nature of commerce and owner the web has become a set of walled gardens. And because it didn't really have a native money construct and because it didn't have a native identity construct the default business model for the internet ended up being advertising. And that went reasonably okay for a little while and then I think it's effectively gone off the rails. </p><p>Technology is just too powerful at this point and it's being wielded by very smart people and it's hurting most of us and it's--it is tearing the fabric of societies. So, Web 3.0 represents a new paradigm that's going to take a while for us to--to figure out how to effectively deploy it. But I--I believe it will be much more respectful of people's attention and information that I believe it will enable people to have much greater agency in the networks in which they operate. And I believe it will--I believe it will emphasize collaboration and facilitates collaboration over-over competition. </p><p>BRUMMER: Next two questions. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) cofounder and CEO of (INAUDIBLE). Joe, as a founder of ConsenSys, I'm curious whether you see yourself further focusing on building applications and first developing exclusively a (INAUDIBLE) system or collaborating also with a broader blockchain system as a technology frameworks. </p><p>And in a broader sense, I would be curious to hear about your plans for ConsenSys for the next one to three years? </p><p>BRUMMER: I wanted you to take two questions because there are quite a few and you can answer them both. </p><p>QUESTION: Tom Gross with George Washington University. </p><p>BRUMMER: Good luck. </p><p>QUESTION: So, three days of this conference and I don't think I've heard anyone use the words, quantum computer. So, you know, we Ethereum, ERC20, everything I look at. Everything is based on ERC20. Even though other, better tokens I think have come out. People don't seem to want to switch away to it. And everything seems to be based on SHA256. So is this whole thing going to collapse when quantum computers mature, which in my opinion, is happening a lot faster than people realize? I'm only aware of a small handful of companies addressing these issues. I think Nexus in Scottsdale is one. They are trying to build a--a SHA1024 system. How is this going to play out in your mind? </p><p>BRUMMER: Two very different questions. </p><p>LUBIN: Yeah. So, I can answer the second one first cause it's an easy one. There you need quantum algorithms in order to make use of quantum computers. And we are still a fair distance--despite what Google recently said. We are still a fair distance away from really viable quantum computer systems. And, we already know so many different ways to operate in a quantum safe way, so Ethereum can use shore(SP) signatures or Lamport signatures. It's not a concern it's--it's as much a concern for the banking systems as it is for blockchain systems. And we will, unless the NSA has a--a 20-year head start or 15-year head start, which is possible. We'll get good telegraphing of when we need to change things. That's the way it's been working in cryptography for a very long time. </p><p>I believe the previous questions were about whether we pay attention to work or do work outside of the Ethereum ecosystem--is that the first phase? That was the first part of the question? So, yeah we're not-- </p><p>BRUMMER: The question being (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>LUBIN: We use the best technology available and Ethereum technology is really good for public blockchain infrastructure and it's as good as anything else probably better than anything else for private permissioned network systems. That said, we have people that we've hired from IBM and R3 who are very good with the fabric and the CORTA technology and how we've won project that sort of came out of the R3 space and it is now a project that we are closely associated with that is using the CORTA technology. </p><p>But we do see an Interledger world and are happy to see interoperation between different networks at--at this point we don't see much utility in building new systems using non Ethereum technology. We do anticipate seeing sort of layer two Ethereum networks linked into the base trust layer and sort of like--like the node system it just makes sense to use the same technology at--at multiple layers of a complex architecture that you are building. </p><p>What are we doing in consensus over the next few years? More of the same, more coherent. We have streamlined very significantly into a software product company and so, we will essentially we are building a very coherent software product offering that enables anybody to spin up blockchain. It is sort of a launchpad for blockchain networks. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you so much for coming by, first of all, I'm Shivani(PH) I'm a Master of Law student at the Georgetown University (INAUDIBLE). My question is a little more philosophical. Capitalism I thought strived on the scarcity principal. And with the kind of development that we are having in block--technology that (INAUDIBLE) technology trade, money and assets are going to be available to people sooner or later. How do you think that's going to change the economics of things? </p><p>LUBIN: It was really hard to hear that. How do I think that blockchain economics? </p><p>BRUMMER: What was like u--ultimately to the extent of which you are getting all these new use cases and whether, for example, one of your initial comments was you are not--when you think about either in particular it's not just a money but it's--it's the fuel for (INAUDIBLE) how does that ultimately then sort of end up impacting economics especially when you are operating in multiple jurisdictions cause you have all these new kind of money like I guess I'm interpreting sort of, applications--building new money like products on top of the blockchain? Do you think you can end up changing the way in which economics is operating? </p><p>LUBIN: Yes. Yes, it will change the way economics operates. I think not the deep principals, but yeah, natively digital assets will transform everything. We--we are essentially seeing a digitization of global society and effectively up to this point everything that we do in--in transactions references analog constructs. So, money is effectively analog even if it's digitized in centralized databases. Identities analog, our agreements are analog, our justice system is analog. We at our company and others in our space have--have created natively digital versions of all those things. These are versions that are realized first on decentralized database systems. And because of the trust that you get from that because of the digitization it squeezes all of the delays and the frictions out of every transaction in society. </p><p>So, anything that would have involved money clearing settlement identity has now the clearing settlement that extends over hours, days and weeks in some cases and we're compressing all of that into the instance of the transaction. So, it will get much more efficient and I think the velocity of growth in society is going to be different. </p><p>So, I think that's a qualitative difference but we're all going to have to see how that ramifies. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's very interesting--I mean, the velocity of money itself is cold--could change. As you can see, we have about 33 seconds left for this particular panel. And, I just see some really eager people but unfortunately, we are going to have to keep it here. We will be going into however, the economic question with the heads of like major players as well as New York regulators in our last session on money and monetization. But, Mr. Lubin--Joe, thank you so, so very much for--for taking the time to talk to us about this. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. Thank you, Joe and Chris. We are going to take a quick 10-minute break and then we are going to finish up--five, OK. Change in plans. Make it a five-minute break and then be back in your seats for the last panel. Thank you. </p><p>NOLAN  With our final panel on what does Wall Street want? So, can everyone just quiet down and get to your seats, that'd be great. To lead off today's discussion, Maria Adamjee, founder and principal at Megalodon Capital will get us underway. So, I'll turn it over and-- </p><p>ADAMJEE: Wonderful. So, I know everyone's kind of gearing up to--to wrap the evening up and, you know, we've heard a lot of good content. So, we promise we'll keep it interesting and hopefully share with you information that you don't already have to make this final hour kind of worth it as we get into the home stretch. </p><p>So, the--the panel is called What Does Wall Street Want? And collectively, you know, there's--there's a constant tussle between-- </p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>BECCIA: Financial services companies and helping them innovate. And so, we do a number of different things from business advisory to working more in the weeds and-- </p><p>ADAMJEE: (INAUDIBLE) So, what we hope to kind of accomplish today is address kind of what is it that we actually want from all of our different perspectives and how does the industry evolve from there. </p><p>So, before we get started, you know, I'd like everyone to kind of introduce themselves on the panel, talk about your firms as well just to kind of get some context about your opinion from--from your standpoint. </p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>BECCIA: Well, I spent the majority of my career in the banking space as a lawyer, as a compliance officer. And also did government relations work as a chief regulatory counsel for a large trade association here in D.C. And then, but over the last few years I was a general counsel for an early stage (INAUDIBLE) exchange firm called Circle Internet Financial. And so, spent a lot of time trying to get through and have this new different technology evolve and mature and try to think through these issues that we're gonna talk about today. So, looking forward to the conversation. </p><p>BUCHANAN: Hello. I'm Mary Beth Buchanan. I'm the general counsel to Kraken, which is a global internet--not internet, digital currency exchange. You'll have to excuse me. I just flew back from Abu Dhabi last night 14 hours. And so, I'm a little foggy. But, I will try to stay awake because it is time for drinking there. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TUTEJA: One more hour. </p><p>BUCHANAN: So--so, Kraken is based here in the United States. We trade approximately 25 digital assets and growing every day against six international currencies. And while we're headquartered in San Francisco, we do business with customers all over the world, almost all over the world except in prohibited companies. </p><p>We, because of that, we have to have a very rigorous program to make sure that we know our customers and we know them very well. And that we are offering appropriate assets to customers in countries where--where we can offer them. We also offer over the counter trading. And we're always looking at other innovative products that we can offer our customers. </p><p>Before joining Kraken as a general counsel I was in an international law firm and I represented some other exchanges and coin developers. And prior to that I was with the Justice Department and I served as a United States attorney in Pennsylvania and also spent a little bit time with the United Nations. </p><p>TUTEJA: Hi, everyone. I was gonna complain about how I took a red eye from San Francisco but I won't do that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>She's got me beat. My name is Sunayna. I'm the head of digital assets and DLT at TD Ameritrade. For those of you who may not know TD Ameritrade, we are one of the largest retail brokerages of the United States. You know, giving me the honor of serving over 15 million--15 million retail clients here and in Asia, and also over 7,000 RIAs. So, what my team and I really do at TD Ameritrade is part of a broader mandate that I have, for some reason, they call us the Tiger team. Our CEO started calling us that one day and I'm like okay, I guess Tiger team better than a squirrel team. So, I own it. </p><p>But, really the mandate for my team and I is really how do you lean in and tap into the power frontier technologies ranging from crypto but also inclusive of AI machine learning and VR and kind of the whole basket of new technologies, but very focused with a lens of how do you commercialize these technologies in a way that are helping us solve gnarly problems and cure inefficiencies within financial services. But, at the end of the day deliver value to the end consumer and kind of help break down those barriers so more and more consumers here or in Asia can start to engage with capital markets with greater education and confidence. </p><p>WHITE: Hi, everyone. I always like to see who's sticking around for the last panel of a three-day conference. So, you are all fanatics in my book, which may be a compliment, it may not. Chris White, I'm the founder and CEO of ViableMkts. We are a strategic consulting firm that works with a lot of traditional Wall Street firms. We're located right, literally, a stone's throw from Wall Street. </p><p>We also host an annual conference that's focused on institutional digital asset market structure, really teasing out the main issues that's being discussed by the large investment banks, as well as large asset managers. I think what I can best contribute to this discussion is maybe what the--the investment banks, the cell side, is thinking about this space. Though I don't absolutely represent as speaking for anyone of those banks. They--they all have their own opinions. </p><p>HOMER: My name is Matt Homer. I'm the executive deputy superintendent for research and innovation at the New York Department of Financial Services, which is sometimes called DFS. DFS is responsible for supervising banks, non-depository license holders, insurance companies and companies operating in the virtual currency space in the State of New York. We supervise over $7 trillion in assets across those sectors. </p><p>I joined recently to stand up a new division for research and innovation, which--which (INAUDIBLE) talk about a little bit later. But, one piece of that division is DFS's activities related to virtual currencies. And it's a pleasure to be with all of you. </p><p>ADAMJEE: All right. Thanks, everyone, for those comprehensive introductions. So, we have a wide array of experiences and backgrounds here. So, you know, I'll just right away, throw the baton to Sunayna. </p><p>So, what does Wall Street want? </p><p>TUTEJA: Okay, do we have time. Yeah. So, I'll start with there's a natural view. And I'm sure, you know, we'll double click into (INAUDIBLE) to our hearts content throughout the panel. So, I start with really, you know, whether it's us or, as Chris mentioned, a lot of our peers in financial services, when we think of, you know, frontier technologies, you know, and everything that encompasses, you know, what--what--what predicates our entry into it. And I know we talked about how much we loathe the term digital transformation, but it kind of is kind of apropos </p><p>So, our thesis is really threefold. One is just the variety and velocity of new technologies coming at us is exhilarating. But, also daunting. So, you can't escape from it. You know, if you're an existing finserv, regardless of your size, scale, tenure, you have to start to say what does this mean; how do we apply it? You know, you have to start to leading into it. So, I think just the technologies coming our way. It's kind of like a king green (PH) explosion, right, no escaping it. </p><p>But the thing that we really focus on is the second point which is not so much about the technology, but more so how are these technologies fundamentally altering consumer behaviors and expectations? </p><p>So, let me give you an example. How many of you--of you in the room either have given the advice in your lifetime or received said advice, which is don't ever, ever, ever get into a stranger's car. If a stranger pulls up next to you, you scream, you run, but you never get into a stranger's car. Okay? So, I'm seeing some nods, good. </p><p>Well, what did many of you do today or this week? You went to your favorite smart phone, clicked on your favorite ride sharing app, essentially summoning a stranger. I know I got into it and there was no kicking or screaming. Actually, I went to the lollipop because he had like a little plate of treats, which is very kind. And I was taking a red eye and needed some sugar. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>It's a cheeky anecdote, but what it illustrates is there was a confluence of technologies that had to come together via mobile, GPS, AI, machine learning to enable ride sharing. But, what's it done it's fundamentally altered consumer expectations and behavior, but it's also changing societal norms, right? Within my lifetime we went from saying don't get into a stranger's car to doing it. I was telling Maria I spent a lot of quality time on the Newark flight from Newark to SFO because I live there, but I work in Newark. And you want a bunch of grown adults turn into bratty toddlers; watch that Wi-Fi drop for 10 minutes. And you kind of go, wait, I'm in this tin can at 30,000 feet jetting across the sky at 500 miles an hour and my core expectation is I need Wi-Fi. When just a few years ago seemed unfathomable, just as a few years ago the fact that I would banking or trading on my mobile device seemed unfathomable because I use my mobile device mostly to play Candy Crush and Farmville. I don't know about you. </p><p>So, the point I'm making is the delta that means something being (INAUDIBLE) and nice to have to becoming a necessity or a need to have, happens like that. And those consumers are our consumers. And they don't care that you're a financial services company. They don't care that you're regulated and I say that respectfully as I sit in D.C. They say if I can this with Company XYZ, my experience with a financial services company ought to be the same. </p><p>So, I think all of those things together, and I think for us combined with the fact at TD Ameritrade we very proudly consider our legacy to be that, you know, we were one of the original fintechs. We've always leaned into looking at how do we use the best technology of its times to help make capital markets more accessible. So, I would say those privies really predicate why we do believe digital transformation, as much as I cringe saying it, is very important. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>ADAMJEE: So, Chris, on that note, you know, what--what is digital transformation? Like, what does that mean for Wall Street? I mean, let's kind of make Sunayna feel better about using that buzz word when we're not supposed to today. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WHITE: I mean it really depends on your perspective. Again, I think I'll give the perspective from what--what a Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan or CitiGroup would view digital transformation to be. I think for--for a lot of--the lot of feedback we get from our event is regulatory clarity is needed. In fact, in New York the word crypto is a dirty word. You will not get people coming from those institutions attending events with the crypto title in it because there--there is sort of this the negative connotations associated with it. </p><p>So, to--to further your point, I think that what we're looking at right now is a cultural transformation that's being accelerated by technology. So, you can no longer do things the same way. You have to think forward as to where do we need to anticipate the--the puck is going to go. But, at the same time you have to do it in such a way that it doesn't create reputational risk. So, that's why a lot of the large institutions are--are waiting to hear from the SEC and the SATC (PH) what they think about certain things before they are aggressively pursuing some of these ideas. </p><p>I'd say that actually brings up another theme where I think inherently we are embracing what the digital asset market structure community is promising, which is swift, swift and rapid evolution. But, there's a tradeoff there because if you want speed in terms of evolution there are going to be some mistakes. And some of those mistakes are going to hurt and cause problems. So, how do we balance out speed with proper regulation, which will inevitably slow down the pace of change? </p><p>So, I think really first and foremost what we hear consistently is just clarity on what the rules are. And then we can figure out how to build a strategy around those rules. </p><p>ADAMJEE: And, John, your experience is very, you know, unique and outstanding in this panel because it marries fintech and regulation. So, how do you see these innovations managing the unique challenges that come with regulation that's often coming after the fact, after the disruption has happened and after adaptation has already occurred? </p><p>BECCIA: Right, right. When I think of the terms innovation and regulation they don't seem to always connect or the two don't marry, right? And so, the technology is always gonna move faster than the regulation. And so, you know, what we've seen now play out over the last few years is a lot of continued uncertainty. So, when you ask the question of what does Wall Street want I think, obviously, it's clarity and certainty and also maturity within the institutions as they develop ways, not only on the technology side, but how do we comply or how do we build a regulatory framework around some of these things. </p><p>So, you see, not only in the U.S. where there's a patchwork--patchwork of regulations, both at the federal and state level, but you see a lot of arbitrage from a global perspective as well in terms of the way they treat and it's not just crypto currency, a lot of these emerging business models, on the payment side and the lending side, and, frankly, you know, there are as many benefits as they have, there's also a lot of risks. And so, we need to think through those. And some of them could be clearer and some could be unintended consequences. If you think about on the lending side and the ability to make credit decisions using algorithms and a different underwriting sources it could be a good thing. It could be access to credit for new people. But, it could also potentially discriminate against certain users. </p><p>And so, all those things need to be thought out. So, what does that mean for someone who's starting in the industry and the approach and how do you overcome that? I've been through this. So, with a startup in a new space, you know, I started at Circle, was one of the first hires in 2013. And it was okay, what is the regulatory framework? How do we get licensed? What's the roadmap? And how do we build a compliance program around these things where there's not a lot of answers for--from a regulatory perspective. But, it's--it really comes down to being both activities based and risk based. And so, you have to look what are you doing as a business model and then what are the risks and, you know, it's never a risk elimination exercise. It's a risk mitigation exercise. </p><p>And on the other side of it, we've seen from a regulator's perspective the question always lies where do you draw the line? How do you allow innovation to flourish without tempering it, but also protecting us of the risks? And, you know, the mission of a regulator is to protect against things like safety and soundness or, you know, the buckets of risks that we talk about on the AML side, consumer protection, securities issues, and how do you bring those--all those things together in an environment where technology is just moving so quickly. </p><p>And so, you know, we've seen some examples of this, you know, we have our friend from the DFS here and I went through the process at Circle. We were the first to get the bit license. And, you know, say what you want about the bit license, but it was a good kind of litmus around how do you build a new regulatory regime and framework in this environment? And some of the things they got right. And some of the things, just because of the way the technology is moving, probably need to be reconsidered now. And so, the question lies, do we need a principles-based framework? Do we need some other way to, again, allow--get these two things--two sides to marry? And that's--that's really a key consideration. </p><p>And, you know, frankly, you're also seeing areas--there's a whole lot of examples and we can get into it, around where there is continued uncertainty, whether it's on, you know, on the securities tokens in the crypto space, whether there's gaps around, on the AML side, around complying with things like the travel rule. All these issues need to be thought--thought through. And that really--I think what the real question for me is is what is the framework for--for thinking these things through? I think now we see most regulatory agencies have offices of innovation, which is a great thing. You know, there's forums for discussions around these things. But you can build all the guidance you want, but at the end of the day you still--every fact and circumstance is different. And, you know, it's hard to--to be able to build a business when you don't have the certainty that what you're building fits within the regulatory space or you're in a safe space from a regulatory perspective. </p><p>So, you know, as we integrate on this is there a better way to do that? You know, certainly there is areas where we can get more regulatory clarity and a regulatory or a legislative fix, but things like no action letters and other requests for regulatory clarity are difficult because that process is so slow. I mean these tech companies, you know, they move fast. They want to get into beta. They want to get a product to market. And it becomes--it becomes really difficult. </p><p>And, the last thing on the flip side of that is, you know, from a--I mentioned maturity. From an industry perspective there's also a need for the industry to up the game to coordinate the develop best practices. I think we're not in a--you know, certain industries we're not ready for an SRO, you got to, you know, walk before you can run or even stand before you can walk. But we are ready for having more best practice going to the regulators with a framework, with solutions. You know, you've seen some of this now where there's been attempts, you know, there's a bunch of crypto exchanges came up at a crypto ratings council. You know, there's other industry associations trying to develop things around, you know, addressing some of these gaps and the risks in the regulation. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah, and it sounds like, you know, there is possibly a disparity between how innovation from the east coast approaches regulators versus innovation coming out of the west coast, right? It seems like west coast innovation might be more reactive as opposed to proactive. Would you agree with that? </p><p>BECCIA: Yeah, well, I think just in general there's a wide spectrum of companies in this space and how they approach regulation. And, you know, some are the ones that are gonna be proactive and want to go in and be transparent. And the other ones are gonna, you know, ask for--want to ask for forgiveness on the back end, right. And, you know, I think--I think traditionally Silicon Valley was more on the spectrum of well, we're just gonna get to market. We're gonna get to market. But I think that's changed quite a bit. And I think you're seeing at--a quite big investment in, you know, regulatory engagement. You're seeing more folks being engaged in D.C. on the government relations front. You know, we're working with more and more companies in this space. </p><p>You're seeing, you know, even in investments, in investment rounds, you know, when people are raising capital they're building in. they're baking in, you know, the need for infrastructure around compliance, around security protocols, around all these things to make sure that they're building the products in the most efficient--from a much efficient standpoint. And I think at the end of the day, you know, the winners are gonna be the ones that see the compliance and the regulatory pieces a competitive advantage. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Sure. </p><p>BECCIA: And the ones that are, you know, going in and I could--I always give this example, but, you know, when we were at Circle, no one, at those days, wanted to, you know, they really thought crypto was crazy. And, you know, because we were built--you know, bank like compliance program because we spent a lot of time with regulators, with law enforcement, you know, inviting them to our office, showing them our systems, discussing all these issues, it really ended up helping us in terms of getting bank partners, getting investors, getting licensing. And so, those are all good examples in terms of where are you gonna lie on the spectrum and how much you're gonna actually engage from a public policy standpoint. I think there is--there is a benefit to it. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Sure. So, Matt, you know, from a completely East Coast perspective, you know, what is the DFS doing to help fintechs with said innovation? And then, you know, the finserv community in general bringing in some of that innovation? </p><p>HOMER: Sure, yeah, thanks for the question. And I'll make some general comments about fintech and then happy to dive into sort of the crypto space as well. I think, you know, one of the reasons I'm very excited to be at DFS is that we have kind of a very broad mandate, as I was mentioning earlier, but also because our--our statute is relatively recent. DFS is the result of a merger between the banking and insurance divisions. And, as a result of that, we have a mandate that I think allows us to lean into innovation really strongly. </p><p>So, our mandate includes an economic development mandate, a jobs creation mandate, a regulatory modernization mandate and a competitiveness mandate. And I think that that gives us a really strong foundation upon which to--to foster innovation. So, when I think about that mandate and then I look at the global landscape I think about what--you know, where does New York State sit in the global landscape post Brexit. And I really think this is sort of an opportunity, frankly, for New York to really become--I mean it's already a leader in the space, but to really be kind of the undisputed, leading fintech hub in the world. And I think that's something that is not just--I mean it's something that the DFS can help foster, but it obviously takes an ecosystem to accomplish that. </p><p>I think, you know, I'm--I'm only been at the job for a little over a month and I'm trying to figure out exactly which sectors to focus on, how to move forward and which interventions make sense. But, I think, you know, one foundational thing I think is quite important is that we enable a two-way flow of information between the innovators and us. And that we have an open door for innovators. I feel very strongly that we need to democratize access, make it easier for anyone to come in and have a conversation with us. </p><p>So, we'll--you know, I think we'll--we'll probably be doing things like that in the near-term. And then I think on top of that, you can build all sorts of other interesting interventions that other regulators have used like tech sprints (PH), off--you know, challenge priced competitions, pilot programs. I think we'll probably, you know, also be looking at those types of tools as well. And just with a general comment with these innovation offices I think, you know, the tools the regulators typically have in their toolkit are tools to stop things from happening that they don't like. </p><p>And there are very--there are fewer tools to encourage things that you want to see that's not happening in the market. I mean CRA is sort of one legacy example of a tool like that. and I think, you know, what we'll be trying to do and what many regulators are trying to do I think is figure out what are kind of those tools to help the nudge the market in directions where consumers aren't being served. And that's a general comment not specific to crypto but if you look at insuretech, fintech, all over, kind of the, you know, the entire financial services landscape. </p><p>ADAMJEE: And do you see kind of an uptick in, you know, different types of companies kind of knocking on the DFS's door with solutions? </p><p>HOMER: Yeah, I mean, well--I mean we haven't sort of launched a formalized program to structure this, but I mean absolutely I think there's a lot of interest in and eagerness and, frankly, probably pent up demand for people to have these type of conversations. </p><p>ADAMJEE: So, if you were to kind of advise and almost prioritize, you know, what should finserv in New York be looking at? Is it--is it--should they be talking about crypto right now or should they be talking about, you know, maybe other lower hanging fruit like payments or something like this? </p><p>HOMER: I mean, I think there's--there's innovation to be had across the board. I mean we, you know, we--we--we have a regulatory regime for crypto because we see that there's a market there and there are consumers who want to engage in that space. I think that--I'm very excited about the insuretech space. I'm kind of totally new to that space. And the reason I'm excited about it is because I just feel like there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah. </p><p>HOMER: But, you know, I think over the coming months part of what I'm trying to do and with the help of others in the ecosystem is identify what problems should be focused on? What are the most important problems facing consumers. What are the most important problems facing companies from a compliance perspective? What are the most challenging--important challenges facing community banks and credit unions to partner with fintech? </p><p>So, I'm kind of in the process now of just collecting problems. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah. </p><p>HOMER: And then figuring out how we--we start to address those. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Sure. So, Mary Beth, let's keep that flight around the world going. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You just came back from Abu Dhabi. So, I'm curious to hear, you know, what's--what's happening there that differs from kind of what's been happening stateside? </p><p>BUCHANAN: Sure. Abu Dhabi is extremely forward thinking with regard to crypto currency and how this will grow within Abu Dhabi and really the Middle East region. And I believe that the regulatory body didn't even exist five years ago. But, what they saw was that citizens of the emirates were using cryptocurrency or buying it and holding it. And if this was going to happen they wanted to create a framework so that retail customers could be protected, so that banks would understand what this is, that it's not, you know, some new scary thing. And that there would be, you know, a framework so that all of the companies that were going to operate within the region would be operating under the same set of regulations. </p><p>So, about a year ago they put out a draft framework. And they were very collaborative with the industry to allow anyone interested to comment on it. And when I say anyone I mean not just, you know, emirate companies, but companies from all over the world. And they actually listened. And they--they took the comments from would be participants. So, these are from people who hadn't even applied yet. And they took some of those comments. They listened. And they made revisions to the framework. They came out with the framework I would say probably six months ago. Companies have applied and they have issued some initial approvals. And now it's really in the final phases for companies to, you know, get over the--that last step. </p><p>They have developed a completely comprehensive framework that covers everything from custody to the operation and exchange to the operation of a broker dealer. They have brought in the other entities that might touch upon this activity. They brought in the Central Bank to take a look at this and basically if you were gonna have any objections, you know, tell us what those are so that we can address them. </p><p>We recently saw the Abu Dhabi security exchange come out with some draft guidelines of how the exchange activity with regard to tokens that could be securities, how this would be regulated under the exchange. And they've also been very proactive in meeting with financial institutions and explaining to them, you know, what this whole new--this whole new financial area is all about so that the banks are not afraid to bank these companies. So, really they wanted to make sure that if, you know, emirates were going to use this that they were gonna be protected. That there would be market surveillance systems in place that would achieve that goal. But, they wanted to do it in a way that was reasonable, common sense and what was necessary but not over the top. So, they wanted to put in place what they really needed and not more. And I think that's one of the things that really drew us to--to the UAE. </p><p>And I do think that exchanges want reasonable regulation. You know, there--there may be some that, you know, hide in the corners of the world where, you know, there's no regulation and no one is looking. But, really the reputable ones we want some reasonable regulation. And so, we are going to those places. And--and it's, you know, if it's not the United States right now, you know, it's Japan. It's the UAE and we want to go to places that are establishing comprehensive regulatory frameworks. </p><p>ADAMJEE: So, I, you know, Mary Beth said regulation and your eyes lit up Sunayna, so, you know, 15 million clients kind of what--what types of kind of--what types of regulation are they looking for? What types of kind of products or safety nets are they looking for in order to--to operate in and, really, you know, how to cultivate these--these markets? </p><p>TUTEJA: Yeah, no, as I was listening to it, you know, it's--I think that's a great precedence, first of all, I think the level of engagement, and I think it reminds me, again, I wasn't in the room when this was happening, but you hear anecdotes of, you know, when the U.S. did something similar and we got it right, that was the internet, right? I know there's lots of jokes, you know, oh, Al Gore invented the internet or whatever, right? But, I think one place where he gets a lot of credit is, you know, he was instrumental in helping making some big leap changes to the commerce law, which, again, I'm not an expert in any of this, but there was a time where moving money on the internet was essentially a crime. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah. </p><p>TUTEJA: Right? And like--like serious intel level crime, right, not like you busted your car level crimes. So, but and now, like, I mean, we were joking, I'm not why do we still it ecommerce when 90 percent of the commerce kind of happens, E, just like why do we say email when everything is email, like, you know. You know that taxonomy, obviously, hasn't evolved. But, you know, I--I kind of reflect on that because we got it right. We struggled through it. But, we got it right. And look at the benefits that have reaped within the United States. I mean, listen, I live in the heart of Silicon Valley, so I witness it. But, you know, across the United States and across the globe. And I think with this when I hear stories of other jurisdictions almost using our template to this new paradigm I don't know, it creates a little bit of a mix of anxiety and urgency at least because, you know, innovation's no longer bottled up in certain ZIP codes and in certain jurisdictions especially with digital asset this technology is special in a way because it can proliferate anywhere in the world and it is. And if we don't get that side of the sheet right, you know, what I worry most about is, if you will, the talent and the ITs start to leave and once that leaves, it's hard to get it back. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah. </p><p>TUTEJA: So, kind of bringing it back to kind of the--the, you know, the voice of retail client, I agree with Mary Beth and other panelists is, you know, I think when I think of regulations, four Cs, right, I think we're all looking for clarity, consistency. It can't be, you know, every state and every county has its own thing, right. It's always the lawyers that win and I get to say that because I am a lawyer. I don't practice, but it's always the lawyers that win. But, I think commonsense, and I'm glad you said commonsense because, you know, we want smart regulation. You know, I was using this analogy the other day, you know, if you use the hotel in your--if you use the iron in your hotel and I noticed there was a tag that says do not iron clothes while wearing clothes, I'm like, dude, if I got to tell you that, you cannot be handling this, right? So, I think it's smart regulation. </p><p>And then I think the last thing is consumer protection, right. I mean, again, we look at it--everybody gets excited. One of the institutions is gonna come in and bring the scale and, you know, me and my colleagues who work for these institutions, we're just as excited about it. but, we also look at it from a great deal of responsibility and prudence because when you're gonna put this new asset class or technology in front of these consumers and, you know, and there's an important point because the next on ramp that will happen into digital assets and those consumers are going to look very different then us who got in maybe early, right? I often say the clients that I'm building product and experiences for are different than me and, you know, my friends or my colleagues because the majority of my--our clients they're coming into for very pragmatic reasons of hey, this was a good asset allocation, good, you know, diversification strategy. They may or may not be interested in nerding out on crypto Twitter or reading every white paper that comes out. </p><p>So, that's another challenge you have to think about is how do you take this technology and asset class that is inherently complex in nascent and package it in a way--deliver it in a way that's accessible, both from a UIUX perspective, but also from--from a vantage point that they feel educated and inform and confident so they can make the best decisions. And I think those 4 C's become important. </p><p>HOMER: Yeah, I just want to make a couple points on the regulatory space and global regulation and some of the regulatory arbitrage because, you know, we've seen if you're in the crypto space obviously there's a wide ranging set of regulations, you know, there's some that's more friendly regulatory regimes such a Switzerland and Malta and Bermuda and others and some have chosen to ban certain aspects of this. If it's outside of the crypto space, you know, obviously we have a different regime in Europe, for example, on open banking and use of data than we have in the U.S. And, you know, I think this really underscores the need for, as you mentioned, because this is so prolific and so these--these--these companies are being built are global, the ability to scale and build is not just a U.S. problem or a Europe problem or an Asia problem. It's a global problem. And there needs to be an ability to coordinate and collaborate on a global basis. </p><p>And you've seen this on some discreet areas, for example, on the AML space we have the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, you know, coming up with some guidance from on crypto currency, which is more global in nature, a baseline type of regulations are guidelines. And, you know, I think we see now, you know, with companies like Facebook and others and Libra Association are really a catalyst for having this discussion because these things can be so, you know, so large and have such a systemic impact. And so, there's a need, again, to address these on a larger basis. </p><p>And then I would just underscore, again, you know, whether it's global or whether it's, you know, within a certain jurisdiction there really needs to be collaboration in this process. And so, you know, having all the stakeholders at the table, having a process around, you know, some of the guidance we've had in certain areas there has been that, you know, I mentioned the bit license, you know, you was a comment process and what not. But, other areas we haven't. So, I think about what we have now with like the travel rule or with some of the guidance that came up with FinCEN and the Treasury this guidance was delivered. There was no advance notice, you know, rulemaking and the rulemaking process, no opportunity to comment. Same thing with some of the recent like tax guidance that just came out from the IRS. </p><p>And so, you know, some of this stuff because there needs--there needs to be an education on both ends of it. And I think there's a learning that can be done. and that's why I also think like things like sandboxes and other ways to have these testing environment or experiment as the technology evolve are all good things because otherwise we're not gonna get to that certainty that we need. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah, I think beyond tech, you know, Chris you're--you're a capital markets guy, right? </p><p>WHITE: Yeah. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Like, you know, it's--so, the fragmentation across like what every region is doing for venues and things like this is disseat. But, there's also a lot of confusion on the different products that have been released for crypto, right. </p><p>WHITE: True. </p><p>ADAMJEE: So, there's spot, there's futures, there's like multiple derivatives, there's like an a while options market. And then there's all sorts of other stuff that people are just kind of creating, right, like because it's--it's not necessarily regulated to the degree where people cannot innovate. So, people are innovating different products. </p><p>You know, what are kind of the advantages of trading one product over the other and do you think that there's just so much confusion and that's kind of part of the reason there hasn't been as much liquidity drive as, you know, we expected? </p><p>WHITE: Well, there are a couple things going on. One thing I do want to point out and it's something that we don't like to accept. But, in order for there really to be urgency around regulation somebody's got to get hurt and get hurt very badly because if we look at the way that modern markets have evolved major regulation, especially in the United States, is always preceded by crisis. The securities acts of 33 and 34, preceded by the crash of 29. Most recently, Dodd-Frank preceded by the crisis in 2008. If you really want to get to minutia the--the acts taken by the SEC towards the equity market after the crash of '87 that led to the modern day equity market. So, that's because it seems to me that in order for regulators to actually do something they have to have the political capital to do so. </p><p>Nobody wants to accept the liability of being wrong here. So, there are lots of times where rules come into a market and then something goes wrong. And then we blame the rule makers. So, you do get more political capital as a regulator if you're fixing a problem as opposed to putting in regulations in anticipation of a problem. </p><p>I hope that we can have a coherent discussion as an industry so that we can start putting in rules that make sense before somebody gets hurt. But, that doesn't seem to be the pattern for any meaningful, widespread regulation. </p><p>Now, when it comes to trading what I find really kind of fascinating is just how small the digital asset market is compared to other markets. You know, a number I like to talk to people about is a trillion. So, a dollar is to a million what a million is to a trillion. So, the U.S. government bond market is about $16 trillion market. And that's a market that has very little regulation right now. When we compare the size of that market let's say to even bit coin. I think somebody up here said that bit coin was maybe $250 billion, is that right? Am I working on the right numbers? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Roughly, yeah. </p><p>WHITE: So, it's infinitesimal. It's like when you go to the planetarium and you see earth and then you see some like red giant, and you're like, my God, we're insignificant. So, just from an outstanding size standpoint I don't know whether we're there yet. So, when we're talking about things like liquidity we're talking about really a retail market by definition in terms of its size. What we have seen is that when institutions do enter into digital asset markets they are finding that the infrastructure that they need to move large positions is not there. </p><p>And I don't--I know that a lot of people are working on certain products that help with moving risk like index products like ETFs, but here we are again the situation where there's really not a lot of clarity is around, am I allowed to produce this product? Am I allowed to sell it to individuals? And so, we're sort of deadlocked here. </p><p>There are certainly opportunities. I don't--in terms of trading I just don't know whether those opportunities are just due to maybe regulatory arbitrage or infrastructure arbitrage and so they're not really sustainable over a long period of time. But, I do know that, you know, if I'm giving advice to someone who's coming out of college and they're saying what should I get into? Looking into sort of the capital market applications of digital asset technology and digital asset products I think there's absolutely a future. There's--it's just gonna be messy and it probably won't move as fast as any of us on this panel want it to move. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah, but it's a great opportunity for, you know, people coming out of school today to kind of get in from the ground up, right, and get it on the internet before it becomes the internet, right? </p><p>I was very envious that I wasn't around and I complained to my dad I'm like what's my generation gonna do? All the good things have been done. So, I'm so glad crypto came along. So, so on that--on that same theme, you know, Mary Beth, is winter over? Are we gonna like--is everything gonna ramp up again? Is 2017 coming back we're all gonna make it rain? </p><p>BUCHANAN: Yeah, I think so. You know, I think that we are coming out of the winter. And we're seeing things picking up again. Before I move into springtime I'd like to offer a few comments to what Chris said. It really is a shame that the U.S. regulators wait until something bad happens because when they do that they also overreact. I mean think Sarbanes-Oxley. And it would be great if they could actually, you know, for once, try to help this fledgling market grow and help this innovation grow. And try to, you know, set some reasonable regulation. And do what they tell us to do all the time with compliance, you know, monitor, constantly monitor, you know, change it when you need to change it. And maybe our regulators need to lead more by example and be a little bolder and come out with some regulation, you know, before it's some danger point so that this technology and innovation can grow in the United States. </p><p>So, getting back to springtime. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Yes, I do think that we are coming out. And we have seen the, you know, the prices, you know, move up over the last couple of months. You know; unfortunately, though I think that we have seen that, you know, the markets do react to the mainstream press, you know, think about the Libra announcement and what that has done. And the corrections do seem to be a little exaggerated in the negative. And so, we'll see a, you know, a downward trend and then an upward movement again. </p><p>Decentralization is definitely something that the market seems to want. It is a good thing. There is an appetite, I believe, for innovative monetary products. Think about Wyoming. I don't know if any of you have been following what's going on there, but, you know, who knew Wyoming is gonna be a leader in some monetary policy creating a special depository institution. And hopefully that--we're gonna see a lot of new things coming out of Wyoming. And really we're seeing it because it isn't happening anywhere else. And they have really taken the initiative to do something innovative there. </p><p>I think that we have seen this time where institutional investors have maybe taken the winter to maybe stock up and store up. And it looks like when prices were low, we did see a lot of buying in those prices. And so, hopefully we're gonna start seeing more movement and hopefully more institutional movement. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Sure, go ahead. </p><p>TUTEJA: Can I (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah. </p><p>TUTEJA: And so, I think kind of tying to winter and the regulatory piece. So and process contrary and (INAUDIBLE) feel free to jump on me I actually think that crypto winter was very good for us, right? I think A, from a new entrance, perhaps, coming in and you see that's a buying option. But, I'm also kind of--part of my job is also product development and making, you know, investments in this arena. And I know we significantly saw the quality of projects that start to come out of that crypto winter become stronger. Because in a way the winter kind of drove away a lot of (INAUDIBLE), right, because like, oh, well, this is harder than it seemed like when I saw. And I think the people who stuck on are the ones that are really committed to it. </p><p>And I think the second thing is the people who stuck on are really focused on solving gnarly problems that need to be solved, whether it's on the infrastructure front, whether, you know, they get some of the--some of the basic things we take for granted in traditional capital markets that we have to kind of build and iterate for crypto market. So, I think the people who've stuck on it, at least from my vantage pew, I feel like, you know, I'm not being bombarded by like 900 white papers. And I have to like find that one thing. Like the people I'm meeting they're smart. </p><p>And I think the other thing there's a saying, it's not mine it's (INAUDIBLE) who says follow where some of the smartest people are going and what they're doing on nights and weekends, right, because that's gonna be the next big thing. And you see really wicked smart people leaving like really good paying job and saying no, I'm going all around crypto and I believe I can solve this problem. So, I think the winter in a way was good in that way. </p><p>And I think the other reason the winter is good and not to get all (INAUDIBLE) on you is I think there's this level of responsibility we the industry have too because the more good behavior we demonstrate the more we cull the bad news stories associated with crypto. And it's more the good news stories of (INAUDIBLE). Look, they did this right or, you know, what Mary Beth and Kraken are doing or what we're trying to do or others in our category. So, I also feel like, you know, focusing on the problem and doing things that's worth doing combined with good actors. I mean, let's be honest storytelling is a big part of anything but especially something that nascent, so the more we can wrap this around that that--I think that helps all of us. </p><p>BECCIA: One quick point, I think when we talk about the crypto winter I think, you know, we're tend to be focused not on the right things. So, I think everybody is--you know, we have 2,500 over 2,500 cryptocurrencies. Everyone's always focused on the price of bit coin or a name your cryptocurrency and the volumes and things like that on--and the exchange side. But, really is more interesting to me is the use of distributed laser technology and the block chain, you know, within financial services and beyond. And even in financial services we haven't hit that tipping point of the true use cases and the things that can be built and used on that. And I think that's really where--where I see the spring and I see a lot of investment money going into these developments and new products and services. And, you know, when I see people come to me and say I'm starting another exchange I say that's all right, but, I--you know, do we need another exchange? I don't know. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yeah. </p><p>BECCIA: But when I see these new models and I think we're seeing obviously, you know, stable coins, the tokenization of things, which is really compelling and can be really pervasive in a lot of different use cases. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Sure. Yeah, Matt, you know, kind of on that same theme you probably get inundated with the 900 or so white papers that are not going to (INAUDIBLE) desk anymore and they're probably (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>What are some of the use cases that you're seeing coming out of those white papers and what people are trying to produce? </p><p>HOMER: Yeah, it's a good question. I mean we are seeing--and, you know, fortunately I don't know that I can talk to specificity around kind of what we're--we're seeing sort of kind of applications. But I'd say we have a very healthy pipeline of companies that--that want to license or existing companies that want to, you know, provide their consumers new types of experiences and products. And there is a huge diversity of things and very sophisticated and, yeah, so. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Sure, sure. So, you know, since everyone looks like they're kind of dozing off, I'll just throw a question to the audience and, you know, just anyone can answer those. But, we hit a major milestone in BTC last week. They're only roughly about like 3 million left to mine. What happens to the market as we approach the finish line? Does anyone have an opinion on that? </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, thank you, by the way. And I love New York. And my question when she asks, you asked about West Coast and East Coast? </p><p>HOMER: Yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: What I like about New York is revelation actually is not blocking the technology. They're very proactive because they like to make money. And they know technology makes money. So, I give you guys credit. I love the city. Regarding the winter, the winter has come. It came for the bankers. So, winter should have been always hit the consumer, you know. Banks are now charging fees, (INAUDIBLE) free checking account. They're giving the red carpet. So, winter has come (INAUDIBLE) I would say paradigm, is a new paradigm shift. And you can judge this paradigm that is coming existing principal economics that has been running along past 50 years. I would say since World War II actually. So, the winter has come, but it didn't came for consumer as with this time. </p><p>And I don't agree with you that everybody that were involved they're (INAUDIBLE). There were lots of innocent people lost money. They were not (INAUDIBLE). And with the cryptocurrency beginning of it, 2013, (INAUDIBLE) when we had a first meeting. I don't know you remember or not, during that time (INAUDIBLE) technologies. Like everything else when there's money involved and profit heavy, a lot of profit involved, so bad people would come. But not everybody that lost were (INAUDIBLE). I just want you correct that. I appreciate it. </p><p>TUTEJA: So, yeah, I can add to it. I think--I mean, I'm not painting everybody with a brush. I'm just commenting on the quality of projects that we've seen, you know, and I think the shift. I think the two points I would make is like listen, would any technology--it's not--I think somebody made the point it's not the technology that's good or bad, it's how you chose to apply it, right? And with every technology that's existed the--you know, sometimes the criminals they'll figure out how to use it first before like the same people do, right? So--so, you know, so I think--and anywhere there's a profit motive like, yeah, go figure it out. So, I think my point was more some of that hyper ally and hype kind of settled, which is okay because it kind of gives rise to more quality projects, was my point. </p><p>And I think, you know, the second point I'll make to it and you hit on the head is the place where we really, really focused on is education, because, again, you think about if you want to bring something new that evolving and it has a sense of complexity to mom and dad mainstream consumers and you're conscious about consumer protection we are starting with education. We've spent a lot of our time building up a rich repository of credible content explaining from basics to intermediary to high level. We're not in the advice-giving business. But, we want to say to the consumers if you're interested--and we know they're interested because they ask us about it all the time, here are the facts. Here's credible information from credible people. You make the decision. And I think that education in our space--I mean we still talk about the need for education in traditional capital markets, right? With crypto it's even more paramount. So, I think that's--that's a key area of focus. </p><p>WHITE: So, I take your point. I do think that there's been--that people who've been speculating in digital asset markets have been vilified. But, I'm gonna repeat something that I actually said at the D.C. Fintech conference, so for some of you this will be repetitive. But, the analogue here is really of the commodities market. The commodities market, if you knew the history of commodities in the United States, the railroads and new storage facilities changed the agricultural industry. So, that you could actually get, you know, your potatoes or your cotton from one destination to another within days instead of months. And then when they started storing these goods, it now created the need for financial market innovation. </p><p>The analogue here with digital currency markets is the internet and the cloud have created the railroad and storage facilities for being able to now change the way we move money around because somebody said, and I forget who it was, he said it's easier for you to move money to England by--or London by hopping on the plane and going to Heathrow then it is to actually press the button. So, now we have the infrastructure in place. </p><p>Now, what have we seen in commodities? We needed regulation around defining what the contracts are and making sure that people weren't playing games with what they were delivering. But once that came into play the people who trade commodities today are not farmers. These are people who are speculating. They've actually allowed the market to grow and to be viable. So, the speculators in the digital asset markets play a major role in innovation. And we should respect them. </p><p>I think that the--but, there have been some people out there who, quite frankly, were looking for a get rich quick scheme. And this isn't it. We certainly saw a shift in the people that gathered for our first conference that we ran and our second one. And it happened to be 2017 or 2018; 2018 wasn't nearly as a big. However, the--the quality of the conversation was elevated because I think people were actually talking about how do we make this a sustainable market? And I was less people maybe looking for an angle. But, those people are useful. We need them. Just like we need them in the commodities market today. </p><p>ADAMJEE: So, look I want to--oh, sorry, do you have a question, go ahead? </p><p>QUESTION: Bill Cunningham of Creative Investment Research. This is for DFS. So, and the question concerns how you're gonna balance the issues. You appear to be protecting incumbents. If you look at your regulatory track record you had Bernie Madoff, you had S&amp;P, you had Moody's, Goldman Sachs, the Lehman Brothers. I could go on. It caused a $22 trillion loss to the economy. And actually caused black wealth to fall by 60 percent. And with your lack of support for the fintech charter it looks like you guys are committed to protecting incumbents in the--and I get it. I get it. You have a lot of financial institutions in your state, you know, I get it. </p><p>The last thing, I should also warn you. We filed a number of amicus briefs in the SD&amp;Y in the appeals court, so your answer might actually wind up in one of our emesis briefs. But, it said balancing, thank you. </p><p>HOMER: Yeah, so--I mean, look, I think as a regulator you're balancing a lot of things. And I think, you know, you're also--you know, we were talking earlier I think about kind of one of the central things that regulators are increasingly trying to figure out which is how do you balance innovation with protecting consumers, right? I think, as you point out, I mean there's also, you know, how do you think about kind of, you know, the role of innovators more broadly. I mean I can't really speak to kind of historical DFS. I mean what I can say is that the fact that--you know, under the new superintendent's leadership she chose to kind of elevate innovation as its own division I think as a signal that we do care about innovation from wherever it comes from, including from companies that are not incumbents. </p><p>And, yeah, I mean, look, I mean I think we have to prove that. We have to show that. And I think we'll do that. </p><p>WHITE: I just want to respond to what you're saying because I think that there's a lot of credibility to sometimes the people that are making the rules maybe are making them for themselves as opposed to the rest of the industry. That's why I think that it's incredibly important that we gather at events like this. You know, what Chris Brumer (PH) and the rest of the team have done here is quite amazing. You got a lot of different opinions but respect is in the same room. </p><p>But, there's a next step that we have to take if we want to see a better market. And the next step that we have to take is we have to create a mission statement for this market. Has anybody here ever written a mission statement for a business? Right, you kind of--you're like do I really have to do this? Sort of I--but, it is actually quite cathartic because if we can create a mission statement that codifies what we are looking for as an industry then it becomes a lot easier for us to look at new ideas and new rules or rule proposals and see whether they map to the industry mission statement or do not. </p><p>I think that what all of us would agree is we want a market that has greater integrity. That's probably a part of the mission statement. Well, then, when we're starting to consider rules around transparency, trade reporting and some of the things that I know that Kraken has to make sure are a part of their--their exchange in order for it to be something that meets the standards of what people would want from an overall performance standpoint. I think they can knock it back to what we as an industry have talked about as what are--what's the goal here? Because I do think that even with the argument around centralization or decentralization is it mapping back to the mission statement? We don't know because we haven't, as an industry, made a commitment towards actually defining what we want. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah, I just--you know, I think, you know, it's important for everyone to understand that and I think in general what Chris was hitting is really important that was a community we all, being a diverse group, and you all being a diverse group, you know, bring out those statements, right, like think--think through those problem statements and think through like what are always trying to solve? Like, what is the point of what we are doing, right? Are we just trying to create, you know, recreate market structure? Or is there a tangible problem, something that's broken, that we're trying to fix? One of the things that we all talked about collectively and we all hit on this separately was the problem of inclusion, right? </p><p>And what crypto products do or what payments do or what insuretech is doing, it is making these industries more inclusive. Technology is helping kind of expand its audience per se. And I think, you know, each one of the panelists can probably kind of address that, you know, and how, you know, inclusion and innovation and these kind of words that we use in everyday language is actually like helping to solve use cases that have landed on our desk at one point or the other. You know, so--so kind of all I'll ask that last--last question, right, because we talked about so many different things today. You know, where--what are we going to be investing in the next five years, right? so, so and I ask that with the lens that a lot of companies have been exposed in the last, you know, several weeks that, you know, it didn't have governance, that didn't have, you know, solid business cases and things like that. And, you know, the market catastrophe as it ensued. </p><p>And so, how do we as consumers kind of protect ourselves from investing, but, moreover, what kind of questions do investors need to ask in order to make sure that their investments are going to the right places? So, you know, I'll start with you, John, but then, you know, Sunayna, I'd love to hear that lens from an institutional perspective as well. </p><p>BECCIA: Yeah, when I think about investing in fintech space it's really, you know, coming up and looking at investments that are, you know, businesses that are coming up with really compelling consumer use cases. And there's a lot out there. There's a lot of copycats type stuff. There's stuff that, you know, similar to the services of banking but done in a different way and just disrupting the traditional financial services. And there's stuff that's really, really innovative. And I think from an investor standpoint, we're seeing this movement into, you know, really focusing on these disrupting type of models, but also the second question that comes up was what's the--what are the risks? And what is, you know, execution risk obviously, you know, there's--where is this ton of benefits because of, you know, the different delivery of financial services and the demographic change with the younger people and Millennials thinking about financial services in a whole different way. But, on the flip side, can we get to market, especially with this whole arc of regulatory uncertainty. How does that fit into it? and so, you know, having these discussions is really, back to my earlier comments at the front end, you know, during an investment process or a funding round and understanding how are you gonna deal with this--these risks are important in terms of determining whether this is viable--viable thing to move on. </p><p>BUCHANAN: You're up next. </p><p>TUTEJA: Yeah, I think I'll double click on what I've kind of shared. I think I've always believed education is the silver bullet. You know, personally and professionally, I mean, it's been a cornerstone for everything we've done for over 40 years as TD Ameritrade part of given the ethos of our business, but secondly, it's, you know, whether you're investing in a startup as a credit investor, whether you're investing in traditional markets and all the (INAUDIBLE), whether you're investing in digital assets, I think at the end of the day, you know, you have to make sure that you're learning about it, right? And, you know, when it comes to digital assets, of course, when you work in this field and everybody has an opinion and they want to share it with you. I was joking when my announcement became public that I was taking on this role, 50 percent of the emails I got were congratulatory and 50 percent were condolences. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But, you know, and everyone's got an opinion and that's cool. But the line I always tell people was it could be (INAUDIBLE), I don't really believe in it and then they'll apologize. I'm like it's okay to be skeptical. But, it's not okay to be ignorant, right? And, I mean, I remember getting into this space in late 2011, early 2012 and I compare that to today, where the number of resources for you to self-learn were so different than today. Today, there's a proliferation of experts who are on podcasts on YouTube channel. I know a lot of these sessions are being live streamed. Like, you know, there's so much credible reading material. And, yes, sometimes it's drama filled. Crypto Twitter can be. It's also very informative. And I always tell people you make up your mind. It's up to you. </p><p>You know, and also I think the cool thing with crypto is, it's very multidisciplinary. Everybody comes into it for their own different ethos and reasons. You know, Wall Street, has a different opinion, technologists have a different opinion. I think that diversity of thought is--I mean, I was on a fork last year where I was deciding of what I should do my PhD, I was gonna either go the AI route or the crypto route. One of the reasons I chose the crypto route was I actually found the crypto community much, much more inclusive and accepting of all different varieties of ethos and diversity. So, you know, I'll end my (INAUDIBLE) with saying there's a lot of information at your fingertips. And, again, kudos to Chris and his team for putting this together. Just scan the book of folks who've attended here today or spoken at, follow them on Twitter. Start with that. And just, you know, invest in your crypto quotient and then make your own decisions. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah, that's great. Chris? </p><p>WHITE: Look, I think the most valuable thing from this entire exercise in innovation is just changing the rules around access to capital. When you change the rules around access to capital that's when we've seen major shifts in world history. Napoleon changed the rules around access to capital and was able to mobilize the biggest army that Europe had ever seen. Prior to that, financing an army was totally different. And we--what we--what's possible is being able to give more people access to actual capital and instead of having to depend on the traditional banking system. </p><p>What I would most like to see is the actual central banking system think about using blockchain and all of this fabulous technology as a part of the way they control the money supply because we have a banking system that's almost 100 years old that literally is using the same workflow of ease the access to capital for the major events and somehow it will get to the individuals. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yeah. </p><p>WHITE: And that has been abused for quite a long time. And so, I'm hopeful that maybe in certain areas of the world central banks can start setting an example where if you want to help the economy in your country start to use crypto and DLT to actually get the money to the people who are actually can start small businesses and hire people instead of just creating a cycle in which like what we've seen in the United States where certain banks can borrow zero and then invest in interest bearing instruments that have no risk. And the taxpayer pays for that. So, that's what I would really like to see from this. I think that's a big change to the way the world works. </p><p>There are other things that are nice, but that's what I think is the most valuable? </p><p>ADAMJEE: Matt? </p><p>HOMER: Yeah, I mean I would--and just picking up on that. So, I'm a big believer that as a supervisor, as a regulator, you can only effectively regulate and supervise these markets when you use some of this technology yourself. And when you--when you kind of really rustle with it and use it in your day to day life and work responsibilities. So, I think from a DFS perspective, I mean, yes, kind of what we'll be investing in. I mean I think that that will be a focus going forward is how do we improve our own technology. How do we use the type of technology that people are talking about here to do our jobs more effectively? </p><p>The other thing I'd say very--you know, very self servantly, is that I'm--you know, I think we'll also be investing in talent and trying to hire people to like, you know, grow our team. I think that it's a very exciting time to be a regulator around this issue. You know, it's a nascent space and we're kind of building the regulatory framework as the market evolves. So, I think it's an exciting time to be a part of that. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Great. Do you have any other questions? I think we probably just have time for one. Yeah? </p><p>QUESTION: I just had a comment. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: Mike Chan (PH), NWC Consulting (PH), the comment about 3 million Bitcoins left to be mined and what are thoughts on that. I think the monetary policy of bit coin (INAUDIBLE) millions of dollars (INAUDIBLE) is one of the most compelling things about Bitcoin making it deflationary. But I think that when miners--at the end when there's very few bit coins left to mine, then the compensated mostly in transaction fees instead of actual bit coin can be a problem with their--with their incentives to continue to maintain the security of the bit coin network. So, just a comment. I know there's a lot of different views about that. So, I would love to just have a-- </p><p>TUTEJA: --We can debate over cocktails. </p><p>ADAMJEE: Let's continue that conversation upstairs. No, all right, that's a wrap. Okay. Thanks. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: This now--so, it's over. Thanks. No, I'm just kidding. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know, everyone, you know, who has been around all week long this has been a huge success to people like those on stage. I do want to thank deeply our host, our co-host; CQ Roll Call has done an amazing job with this venue. Some of these events will be on the podcast. We've been livestreaming.

Traditional media outlets are expecting a suite of measures that will level the playing field and allow them to better monetise their content</p><p>The digital players fear the government will pursue intrusive and \"unworkable\" regulation over the algorithms behind their platforms. They are concerned that global regulators and authorities will be inspired by Australia's measures.</p><p>A source close to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the minister viewed the tech giants as an \"existential\" threat to media companies.</p><p>While Mr Frydenberg will embrace the report's findings, the government is expected to take time to detail its full response. The wide-ranging implications and complexity of the ACCC report's contents may require extensive consultation.</p><p>Tough measures on competition and privacy would open up a new front in the government's fight with the tech sector, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has already taken to task over its role in the dissemination of violent and extremist material online.</p><p>Labor MP Ed Husic said the global industry would be preparing for the report given its potential implications. \"Big tech knows that a lot of regulators have taken a great interest in this and will be wondering if the tremors flying out of the pages of this report will be felt elsewhere,\" he said.</p><p>\"The sector should be rightly worried because they have snubbed their noses at calls to deal with these issues and now it's time for competition law to deal with their failure to act.\"</p><p>Accepting that sweeping changes are inevitable, the tech companies are preparing to mount a concerted effort to manage the report's findings to achieve the best possible outcome for their business interests. The tech lobby has warned that many businesses would be harmed by measures designed to take on Facebook and Google. Smaller businesses and start-ups may not have the capacity to comply with sweeping new regulations.</p><p>The ACCC's preliminary report released in December recommended a range of changes including a new regulatory authority investigating algorithms and the ranking of news, an ombudsman to handle complaints and new rules requiring opt-in consent for data collection.</p><p>The additional oversight has seen existing regulators jostling for territory, with media sources believing the Australian Communications and Media Authority will be given an expanded role in managing the digital platforms. ACMA currently polices the television and radio broadcasters.</p><p>The report also suggested a further review of the regulations currently affecting traditional media companies, a news literacy program and tax-deductible news subscriptions for all Australians.</p><p>Traditional media companies have called on the competition watchdog to crack down on the market power of the tech giants, in particular Google and Facebook, to help them negotiate better rates and terms when using the businesses to share content online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc76dfgq1qa1l1atyembix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN6-3XD1-JD34-V4M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

If Facebook, Google and Apple are all found to be restricting competition with monopolistic behavior, they could face disciplinary actions with one option in the extreme case, forced breakup. </p><p>California's booming economy and government revenue has come to rely heavily on the tech industry. Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said in a statement, 'Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.' The Justice Department review is just the first step and much has to happen before actions could take a bite out of the state's economy. But the step toward trust busting is no surprise. I've reported in the last couple of years of a growing concern over the power centered in a few tech companies. The old trust busting efforts hailed in the early 20th century could make a comeback. While undoing the monopolies over 100 years ago centered on monopolistic control of commodities, like Standard Oil's command of oil, tech controls massive amounts of data. And with their economic power, some Silicon Valley companies are moving into other industries. The trouble for the tech firms is that their popularity is on the wane. Both Democrats and Republicans have raised concerns about the big companies' dominance. In fact, in her list of policy solutions, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has spoken of breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon. Now the Trump Justice Department is following a path that could lead to breakup. Investors have indicated their unhappiness with these developments. If regulations and breakup come what damage would be done to the state economy and revenue gathering? The state would feel a pinch. The potential for less pay for tech's top executives would undoubtedly be reflected in the state's income tax take. Remember that the top 1% of California income tax payers account for about half of the state's income tax revenue which is around 70% of the General Fund. A hit on the incomes of rich tech executives could be felt in the state budget. On the other hand, if a breakup leads to other or new California businesses filling the gap, newly created or increased state revenue could come from taxpayers added to the state's rolls. Further, while Apple and Google's parent company Alphabet are in the top 5 publically traded companies in California, the state's economy relies on other sectors of the economy to flourish. Finance, real estate, agriculture and manufacturing are all bulwarks of the state's economy. Still, the tech industry has been a strong sector partly responsible for the state's rise to the fifth largest economy in the world. Damage to that sector would be felt. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-FXHO1182831564060033096251761300128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FXHO-118283</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-0VP1-JB4V-812W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Fox Hounds( California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Damage to that sector would be felt. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FXHO1182831564060033096251761300128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FXHO-118283</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-40G1-JCMN-Y0V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fox Hounds</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If Facebook, Google and Apple are all found to be restricting competition with monopolistic behavior, they could face disciplinary actions with one option in the extreme case, forced breakup. California's booming economy and government revenue has come to rely heavily on the tech industry.</p><p>Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said in a statement, \"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>The Justice Department review is just the first step and much has to happen before actions could take a bite out of the state's economy.</p><p>But the step toward trust busting is no surprise.</p><p>I've reported in the last couple of years of a growing concern over the power centered in a few tech companies. The old trust-busting efforts hailed in the early 20th century could make a comeback. While undoing the monopolies over 100 years ago centered on monopolistic control of commodities, like Standard Oil's command of oil, tech controls massive amounts of data. And with their economic power, some Silicon Valley companies are moving into other industries.</p><p>The trouble for the tech firms is that their popularity is on the wane. Both Democrats and Republicans have raised concerns about the big companies' dominance.</p><p>In fact, in her list of policy solutions, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has spoken of breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon. Now the Trump Justice Department is following a path that could lead to breakup.</p><p>Investors have indicated their unhappiness with these developments.</p><p>If regulations and breakup come what damage would be done to the state economy and revenue gathering?</p><p>The state would feel a pinch. The potential for less pay for tech's top executives would undoubtedly be refected in the state's income tax take. Remember that the top 1% of California income tax payers account for about half of the state's income tax revenue which is around 70% of the General Fund. A hit on the incomes of rich tech executives could be felt in the state budget.</p><p>On the other hand, if a breakup leads to other or new California businesses filling the gap, newly created or increased state revenue could come from taxpayers added to the state's rolls.</p><p>Further, while Apple and Google's parent company Alphabet are in the top 5 publically traded companies in California, the state's economy relies on other sectors of the economy to flourish. Finance, real estate, agriculture and manufacturing are all bulwarks of the state's economy.</p><p>Still, the tech industry has been a strong sector partly responsible for the state's rise to the fifth largest economy in the world. Damage to that sector would be felt.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBREC-2272173954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTD-R121-DY0W-445P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Desert Publication, Inc. and Sharon Apfelbaum Jul 30, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Public Record, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0744205X</issn><volume>Vol. 44</volume><issueNumber>No. 61</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We see this in the history of retail a lot, large vendors go and create retail brands or in-house brands based on the insights that they are only marginally entitled to, and this is just not the right move.\"</p><p>Lutke said that a good example of how Shopify likes to use data is the recently announced Shopify Fulfillment Network which will handle warehousing and shipping for merchants on the platform.</p><p>\"We can, based on historics of their sales (and) demand course and so on, we can predict - right now we're at about 85 per cent accuracy - from which region the next order is going to come, and where demand is going to be needed,\" he said.</p><p>Shopify revenue was up by 48 per cent to US$362 million, and the company posted adjusted net income of US$4.8 million for the quarter. At the same time, the company raised its guidance for the fiscal year.</p><p>Shopify stock shot up by 10 per cent when the market opened, before falling back to close the day at $451.58 up 7.67 per cent on the TSX.</p><p>According to Suthan Sukumar, analyst covering the company for Eight Capital, one thing really caused the markets to move was the guidance that the company will maintain the same level of profitability, even as they make major investments in expanding their product offering. \"This is still a growth story. There's still significant runway and room for continued investment to make sure that they maintain their competitive position.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

We see this in the history of retail a lot, large vendors go and create retail brands or in-house brands based on the insights that they are only marginally entitled to, and this is just not the right move.\"</p><p>Lutke said that a good example of how Shopify likes to use data is the recently announced Shopify Fulfillment Network which will handle warehousing and shipping for merchants on the platform.</p><p>\"We can, based on historics of their sales (and) demand course and so on, we can predict - right now we're at about 85 per cent accuracy - from which region the next order is going to come, and where demand is going to be needed,\" he said.</p><p>Shopify revenue was up by 48 per cent to US$362 million, and the company posted adjusted net income of US$4.8 million for the quarter. At the same time, the company raised its guidance for the fiscal year.</p><p>Shopify stock shot up by 10 per cent when the market opened, before falling back to close the day at $451.58 up 7.67 per cent on the TSX.</p><p>According to Suthan Sukumar, analyst covering the company for Eight Capital, one thing really caused the markets to move was the guidance that the company will maintain the same level of profitability, even as they make major investments in expanding their product offering. \"This is still a growth story. There's still significant runway and room for continued investment to make sure that they maintain their competitive position.\" Financial Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jmcleod@nationalpost.com\">jmcleod@nationalpost.com</email>Twitter: jamespmcleod !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in an interview with the Financial Post on Thursday.</p><p>On the company's Q2 earnings call for Thursday, Forte asked Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke about the \"four horsemen of big technology\" and how things could shake out if the U.S. government moves to regulate or even break up companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>\"First of all, I think it's a very, very healthy debate for every country and society to just, you know, at least meditate on how the largest companies fit into society, and what roles they should play,\" Lutke said.</p><p>\"When I talk with politicians - and I do - the thing that we get to pretty quickly is that the future needs millions and millions of small businesses creating good jobs for 10 to 50 people, or maybe beyond in certain circumstances. So I do feel comfortable with how Shopify fits within this picture.\"</p><p>The backlash against the world's biggest technology companies, sparked by the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, has been building for more than a year. Last week, the U.S. Justice Department announced a broad antitrust investigation of big tech.</p><p>Forte said that there's a perception that Shopify depends on Facebook, because the platform does a lot of e-commerce social media advertising, especially on Instagram. But Forte doesn't really buy that.</p><p>\"Shopify is less dependent on Facebook than many investors think,\" he said.</p><p>\"I would argue that tomorrow the company could disassociate with Facebook, and it would have a material negative impact, but it would not have a large material negative impact.\"</p><p>The discussion of Shopify's role in the big tech ecosystem also came up when Lutke was asked on the earnings call about Shopify's use of data to drive value for the business.</p><p>Lutke didn't mention Amazon by name, but he specifically talked about one of Amazon's most controversial practices - creating inhouse brands to compete with the small merchants who sell on their platform.</p><p>\"It's an interesting time for data.</p><p>Like, I want to be careful, because there's a really, really strong principle at this company that the data is the merchant's, and we use it to their exact benefit,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's important to say that what Shopify won't do is sort of take the aggregate total and act on the leanings to our benefit. We see this in the history of retail a lot, large vendors go and create retail brands or in-house brands based on the insights that they are only marginally entitled to, and this is just not the right move.\"</p><p>Lutke said that a good example of how Shopify likes to use data is the recently announced Shopify Fulfillment Network which will handle warehousing and shipping for merchants on the platform.</p><p>\"We can, based on historics of their sales (and) demand course and so on, we can predict - right now we're at about 85 per cent accuracy - from which region the next order is going to come, and where demand is going to be needed,\" he said.</p><p>Shopify revenue was up by 48 per cent to US$362 million, and the company posted adjusted net income of US$4.8 million for the quarter. At the same time, the company raised its guidance for the fiscal year.</p><p>Shopify stock shot up by 10 per cent when the market opened, before falling back to close the day at $451.58 up 7.67 per cent on the TSX.</p><p>According to Suthan Sukumar, analyst covering the company for Eight Capital, one thing really caused the markets to move was the guidance that the company will maintain the same level of profitability, even as they make major investments in expanding their product offering. \"This is still a growth story. There's still significant runway and room for continued investment to make sure that they maintain their competitive position.\" Financial Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jmcleod@nationalpost.com\">jmcleod@nationalpost.com</email>Twitter: jamespmcleod !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in an interview with the Financial Post on Thursday.</p><p>On the company's Q2 earnings call for Thursday, Forte asked Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke about the \"four horsemen of big technology\" and how things could shake out if the U.S. government moves to regulate or even break up companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>\"First of all, I think it's a very, very healthy debate for every country and society to just, you know, at least meditate on how the largest companies fit into society, and what roles they should play,\" Lutke said.</p><p>\"When I talk with politicians - and I do - the thing that we get to pretty quickly is that the future needs millions and millions of small businesses creating good jobs for 10 to 50 people, or maybe beyond in certain circumstances. So I do feel comfortable with how Shopify fits within this picture.\"</p><p>The backlash against the world's biggest technology companies, sparked by the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, has been building for more than a year. Last week, the U.S. Justice Department announced a broad antitrust investigation of big tech.</p><p>Forte said that there's a perception that Shopify depends on Facebook, because the platform does a lot of e-commerce social media advertising, especially on Instagram. But Forte doesn't really buy that.</p><p>\"Shopify is less dependent on Facebook than many investors think,\" he said.</p><p>\"I would argue that tomorrow the company could disassociate with Facebook, and it would have a material negative impact, but it would not have a large material negative impact.\"</p><p>The discussion of Shopify's role in the big tech ecosystem also came up when Lutke was asked on the earnings call about Shopify's use of data to drive value for the business.</p><p>Lutke didn't mention Amazon by name, but he specifically talked about one of Amazon's most controversial practices - creating inhouse brands to compete with the small merchants who sell on their platform.</p><p>\"It's an interesting time for data.</p><p>Like, I want to be careful, because there's a really, really strong principle at this company that the data is the merchant's, and we use it to their exact benefit,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's important to say that what Shopify won't do is sort of take the aggregate total and act on the leanings to our benefit. We see this in the history of retail a lot, large vendors go and create retail brands or in-house brands based on the insights that they are only marginally entitled to, and this is just not the right move.\"</p><p>Lutke said that a good example of how Shopify likes to use data is the recently announced Shopify Fulfillment Network which will handle warehousing and shipping for merchants on the platform.</p><p>\"We can, based on historics of their sales (and) demand course and so on, we can predict - right now we're at about 85 per cent accuracy - from which region the next order is going to come, and where demand is going to be needed,\" he said.</p><p>Shopify revenue was up by 48 per cent to US$362 million, and the company posted adjusted net income of US$4.8 million for the quarter. At the same time, the company raised its guidance for the fiscal year.</p><p>Shopify stock shot up by 10 per cent when the market opened, before falling back to close the day at $451.58 up 7.67 per cent on the TSX.</p><p>According to Suthan Sukumar, analyst covering the company for Eight Capital, one thing really caused the markets to move was the guidance that the company will maintain the same level of profitability, even as they make major investments in expanding their product offering. \"This is still a growth story. There's still significant runway and room for continued investment to make sure that they maintain their competitive position.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jmcleod@nationalpost.com\">jmcleod@nationalpost.com</email>Twitter: jamespmcleod !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Davidson analyst Tom Forte said on Thursday.</p><p>On the company's Q2 earnings call for Thursday, Forte asked Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke about the \"four horsemen of big technology\" and how things could shake out if the U.S. government moves to regulate or even break up companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>\"First of all, I think it's a very, very healthy debate for every country and society to just, you know, at least meditate on how the largest companies fit into society, and what roles they should play,\" Lutke said.</p><p>\"When I talk with politicians - and I do - the thing that we get to pretty quickly is that the future needs millions and millions of small businesses creating good jobs for 10 to 50 people, or maybe beyond in certain circumstances. So I do feel comfortable with how Shopify fits within this picture.\"</p><p>The backlash against the world's biggest technology companies, sparked by the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, has been building for more than a year. Last week, the U.S. Justice Department announced a broad antitrust investigation of big tech.</p><p>Forte said there's a perception Shopify depends on Facebook, because the platform does a lot of e-commerce social media advertising, especially on Instagram. But Forte doesn't really buy that.</p><p>\"Shopify is less dependent on Facebook than many investors think,\" he said.</p><p>The discussion of Shopify's role in the big tech ecosystem also came up when Lutke was asked on the earnings call about Shopify's use of data to drive value for the business.</p><p>Lutke didn't mention Amazon by name, but he specifically talked about one of Amazon's most controversial practices - creating in-house brands to compete with the small merchants who sell on their platform.</p><p>\"It's an interesting time for data. Like, I want to be careful, because there's a really, really strong principle at this company that the data is the merchant's, and we use it to their exact benefit,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's important to say that what Shopify won't do is sort of take the aggregate total and act on the learnings to our benefit.

YouTube was found to have censored conflict documentation in Syria, Yemen, and Ukraine.</p><p>The report comes at a time when social media companies are under heavy pressure to weed out terrorists, white nationalists, and other extremist content. In April, the European Parliament voted to require internet companies to remove terrorist content within one hour of receiving an order from authorities. The European Parliament will negotiate with the Council of Ministers on the final form of the regulation.</p><p>Also in April, during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on white nationalism, witnesses from the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Anti-Defamation League called on social media platforms to improve their efforts to flag white nationalist content.</p><p>Social media is a \u201cdriving force\u201d for a recent rise in white nationalist activity and violence in the United States, said Eileen Hershenov, senior vice president for policy at the Anti-Defamation League. Fringe social media sites such as 8chan and Gab \u201cact as echo chambers for the most virulent anti-Semitism and racism and act as active recruiting grounds for potential terrorists,\u201d she added. \u201cThese platforms are like round-the-clock, digital white supremacist rallies.\u201d</p><p>Gab took issue with Hershenov\u2019s description of the site. \u201cGab is an around-the-clock, digital version of the United States of America,\u201d said founder Andrew Torba. \u201cOur policy is to protect all political speech that is protected by the First Amendment. We protect American conservatives, Chinese and Pakistani dissidents, and anyone else who has something to say that powerful interests or lobby groups want silenced.\" </p><p>\u201cIf the ADL has an issue with something a very small subset of our nearly 1 million users are saying, they should create a Gab account and try winning the argument instead of closing the venue,\u201d he added.</p><p>Efforts by social media companies to counter \u201cvitriolic\u201d racist content have fallen short, committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said at the April hearing.</p><p>Just weeks later, YouTube announced in early June that it would ban white supremacist and other discriminatory content.</p><p>One day after the House hearing, Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee complained big tech companies were silencing the voices of conservative commentators online. \u201cOver and over again, I\u2019ve heard from Americans concerned about a consistent pattern of political bias and censorship on the part of Big Tech,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.</p><p>Cruz said Congress should consider repealing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives websites protections from lawsuits for content posted by users. The federal government should also consider taking antitrust actions against the largest tech companies, he said.</p><p>Social media companies should also be subject to fraud charges when they fail to present content in an unbiased manner, Cruz added.</p><p>But government pressure on social media companies can lead to unintended consequences, said Jillian York, co-author of the recent Electronic Frontier Foundation report. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely concerned about the pushes from policymakers in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cAll too often, regulation aimed at extremist content is constructed in such a way that it deputizes platforms to make determinations about who is or isn't an extremist, and as we've seen, companies aren't equipped to do this consistently or fairly.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2239466008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC3-2R91-JBHT-D1WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

The shooters were tracked down and killed later in the day, and FBI agents wasted no time trying to understand the motivations of Farook and to get the fullest possible sense of his contacts and his network. But there was a problem: Farook's iPhone 5c was protected by Apple's default encryption system. Even when served with a warrant, Apple did not have the ability to extract the information from its own product.</p><p>The government filed a court order, demanding, essentially, that Apple create a new version of the operating system that would enable it to unlock that single iPhone. Apple def nded itself, with CEO Tim Cook framing the request as a threat to individual liberty.</p><p>\"We have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy,\" he said in a press conference. Then-FBI chief James Comey reportedly warned that Cook's attitude could cost lives. \"I just don't want to get to a day where people look at us with tears in their eyes and say, 'My daughter is missing and you have her cell phone-what do you mean you can't tell me who she was texting before she disappeared?' \" The controversy over Farook's iPhone reignited a debate that was known in the 1990s as the Crypto Wars, when the government feared the world was \"going dark\" and tried-and ultimately failed-to impede the adoption of technologies that could encode people's information. Only this time, with supercomputers in everybody's pockets and the endless war on terror, the stakes were higher than ever.</p><p>A few months after the San Bernardino shooting, President Obama sat for an interview at the South by Southwest conference and argued that government officials must be given some kind of shortcut-or what's known as exceptional access-to encrypted content during criminal and antiterrorism investigations. \"My conclusion so far is that you cannot take an absolutist view on this,\" he said. \"If the tech community says, 'Either we have strong, perfect encryption or else it's Big Brother and an Orwellian world'-what you'll find is that after something really bad happens, the politics of this will swing and it will become sloppy and rushed, and it will go through Congress in ways that have not been thought through. And then you really will have dangers to our civil liberties.\"</p><p>In typical Obama fashion, the president was leaning toward a compromise, a grand bargain between those who insist that the NSA and FBI need all the information they can get to monitor potential terrorists or zero in on child abusers and those who believe building any sort of exceptional access into our phones would be a fast track to a totalitarian surveillance state. And like so many of Obama's proposed compromises, this one went nowhere. To many cryptographers, there was simply no way that companies like Apple and Google could provide the government with legal access to customer data without compromising personal privacy and even national security. Exceptional access was a form of technology, after all, and any of its inevitable glitches, flaws, or bugs could be exploited to catastrophic ends. To suggest otherwise, they argued, was flat wrong. Flat-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Earth</emphasis> wrong. Which was, as any good engineer or designer knows, an open invitation for someone to prove them wrong.</p><p>This past January, Ray Ozzie took a train from his home in Massachusetts to New York City for a meeting in a conference room of the Data Science Institute at Columbia University. The 14th-floor aerie was ringed by wide windows and looked out on a clear but chilly day. About 15 people sat around the conference table, most of them middle-aged academics-people from the law school, scholars in government policy, and computer scientists, including cryptographers and security specialists-nibbling on a light lunch while waiting for Ozzie's presentation to begin.</p><p>Jeannette Wing-the host of the meeting and a former corporate VP of Microsoft Research who now heads the Data Science Institute-introduced Ozzie to the group. In the invitation to this \"private, informal session,\" she'd referenced his background, albeit briefly. Ozzie was once chief technical officer at Microsoft as well as its chief software architect, posts he had assumed after leaving IBM, where he'd gone to work after the company had purchased a product he created, Lotus Notes. Packed in that sentence was the stuff of legend: Notes was a groundbreaking product that rocketed businesses into internet-style communications when the internet was barely a thing. The only other person who ever held the chief software architect post at Microsoft was Bill Gates, and Ozzie had also helped create the company's cloud business.</p><p>He had come to Columbia with a proposal to address the impasse over exceptional access, and the host invited the group to \"critique it in a constructive way.\" Ozzie, trim and vigorous at 62, acknowledged off the bat that he was dealing with a polarizing issue. The cryptographic and civil liberties community argued that solving the problem was virtually impossible, which \"kind of bothers me,\" he said. \"In engineering if you think hard enough, you can come up with a solution.\" He believed he had one.</p><p>He started his presentation, outlining a scheme that would give law enforcement access to encrypted data without significantly increasing security risks for the billions of people who use encrypted devices. He'd named his idea Clear.</p><p>It works this way: The vendor-say it's Apple in this case, but it could be Google or any other tech company-starts by generating a pair of complementary keys. One, called the vendor's \"public key,\" is stored in every iPhone and iPad. The other vendor key is its \"private key.\" That one is stored with Apple, protected with the same maniacal care that Apple uses to protect the secret keys that certify its operating system updates. These safety measures typically involve a tamper-proof machine (known as an HSM or hardware security module) that lives in a vault in a specially protected building under biometric lock and smartcard key.</p><p>That public and private key pair can be used to encrypt and decrypt a secret PIN that each user's device automatically generates upon activation. Think of it as an extra password to unlock the device. This secret PIN is stored on the device, and it's protected by encrypting it with the vendor's public key. Once this is done, no one can decode it and use the PIN to unlock the phone except the vendor, using that highly protected private key.</p><p>So, say the FBI needs the contents of an iPhone. First the Feds have to actually get the device and the proper court authorization to access the information it contains-Ozzie's system does not allow the authorities to remotely snatch information. With the phone in its possession, they could then access, through the lock screen, the encrypted PIN and send it to Apple. Armed with that information, Apple would send highly trusted employees into the vault where they could use the private key to unlock the PIN. Apple could then send that no-longer-secret PIN back to the government, who can use it to unlock the device.</p><p>Ozzie designed other features meant to reassure skeptics. Clear works on only one device at a time: Obtaining one phone's PIN would not give the authorities the means to crack anyone else's phone. Also, when a phone is unlocked with Clear, a special chip inside the phone blows itself up, freezing the contents of the phone thereafter. This prevents any tampering with the contents of the phone. Clear can't be used for ongoing surveillance, Ozzie told the Columbia group, because once it is employed, the phone would no longer be able to be used.</p><p>He waited for the questions, and for the next two hours, there were plenty of them. The word <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">risk</emphasis> came up. The most dramatic comment came from computer science professor and cryptographer Eran Tromer. With the flair of Hercule Poirot revealing the murderer, he announced that he'd discovered a weakness. He spun a wild scenario involving a stolen phone, a second hacked phone, and a bank robbery. Ozzie conceded that Tromer found a flaw, but not one that couldn't be fixed.</p><p>At the end of the meeting, Ozzie felt he'd gotten some good feedback. He might not have changed anyone's position, but he also knew that unlocking minds can be harder than unlocking an encrypted iPhone. Still, he'd taken another baby step in what is now a two-years-and- counting quest. By focusing on the engineering problem, he'd started to change the debate about how best to balance privacy and law enforcement access. \"I do not want us to hide behind a technological smoke screen,\" he said that day at Columbia. \"Let's debate it. Don't hide the fact that it might be possible.\"</p><p>The first, and most famous, exceptional-access scheme was codenamed Nirvana. Its creator was an NSA assistant deputy director named Clinton Brooks, who realized in the late 1980s that newly discovered advances in cryptography could be a disaster for law enforcement and intelligence agencies. After initial despair, Brooks came up with an idea that he envisioned would protect people's privacy while preserving government's ability to get vital information. It involved generating a set of encryption keys, unique to each device, that would be held by government in heavily protected escrow. Only with legal warrants could the keys be retrieved and then used to decode encrypted data. Everyone would get what they wanted. Thus &amp;#230; Nirvana.</p><p>The plan was spectacularly botched. Brooks' intent was to slowly cook up an impervious technical framework and carefully introduce it in the context of a broad and serious national discussion about encryption policy, where all stakeholders would hash out the relative trade-offs of law enforcement access to information and privacy. But in 1992, AT&amp;T developed the Telephone Security Device 3600, which could scramble phone conversations. Its strong encryption and relatively low price unleashed a crypto panic in the NSA, the FBI, and even the tech-friendly officials in the new Clinton administration. Then the idea came up of using Brooks' key escrow technology, which by that time was being implemented with a specialized component called the Clipper Chip, to combat these enhanced encryption systems. After a few weeks, the president himself agreed to the plan, announcing it on April 16, 1993.</p><p>All hell broke loose as technologists and civil libertarians warned of an Orwellian future in which the government possessed a backdoor to all our information. Suddenly the obscure field of cryptography became a hot button. (I still have a T-shirt with the rallying cry \"Don't Give Big Brother a Master Key.\") And very good questions were raised: How could tech companies sell their wares overseas if foreign customers knew the US could get into their stuff? Wouldn't actual criminals use other alternatives to encrypt data? Would Clipper Chip technology, moving at government speed, hobble the fast-moving tech world?</p><p>Ultimately, Clipper's death came not from policy, but science. A young Bell Labs cryptographer named Matt Blaze discovered a fatal vulnerability, undoubtedly an artifact of the system's rushed implementation. Blaze's hack led the front page of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>. The fiasco tainted all subsequent attempts at installing government backdoors, and by 1999, most government efforts to regulate cryptography had been abandoned, with barely a murmur from the FBI or the NSA.</p><p>For the next dozen or so years, there seemed to be a Pax Cryptographa. You seldom heard the government complain about not having enough access to people's personal information. But that was in large part because the government already had a frightening abundance of access, a fact made clear in 2013 by Edward Snowden. When the NSA contractor revealed the extent of his employer's surveillance capabilities, people were shocked at the breadth of its activities. Massive snooping programs were sweeping up our \"metadata\"-who we talk to, where we go-while court orders allowed investigators to scour what we stored in the cloud. The revelations were also a visceral blow to the leaders of the big tech companies, who discovered that their customers' data had essentially been plundered at the source. They vowed to protect that data more assiduously, this time regarding the US government as one of their attackers. Their solution: encryption that even the companies themselves could not decode. The best example was the iPhone, which encrypted users' data by default with iOS 8 in 2014.</p><p>Law enforcement officials, most notably Comey of the FBI, grew alarmed that these heightened encryption schemes would create a safe haven for crooks and terrorists. He directed his staff to look at the potential dangers of increasing encryption and began giving speeches that called for that blast from the past, lingering like a nasty chord from '90s grunge: exceptional access.</p><p>The response from the cryptographic community was swift and simple: Can't. Be. Done. In a landmark 2015 paper called \"Keys Under Doormats,\" a group of 15 cryptographers and computer security experts argued that, while law enforcement has reasons to argue for access to encrypted data, \"a careful scientific analysis of the likely impact of such demands must distinguish what might be desirable from what is technically possible.\" Their analysis claimed that there was no foreseeable way to do this. If the government tried to implement exceptional access, they wrote, it would \"open doors through which criminals and malicious nation-states can attack the very individuals law enforcement seeks to defend.\"</p><p>The 1990s Crypto Wars were back on, and Ray Ozzie didn't like what he was hearing. The debate was becoming increasingly politicized. Experts in cryptography, he says, \"were starting to pat themselves on the back, taking extreme positions about truisms that weren't so obvious to me.\" He knew that great achievements of cryptography had come from brilliant scientists using encryption protocols to perform a kind of magic: sharing secrets between two people who had never met, or creating digital currency that can't be duplicated for the purposes of fraud. Could a secure system of exceptional access be so much harder?</p><p>So Ozzie set out to crack the problem. He had the time to do it. He'd recently sold a company he founded in 2012, Talko, to Microsoft. And he was, to quote a friend, \"post-economic,\" having made enough money to free him from financial concerns. Working out of his home north of Boston, he began to fool around with some ideas. About two weeks later, he came up with Clear.</p><p>The strength of Ozzie's system lies in its simplicity. Unlike Clinton Brooks, who relied on the government to safeguard the Clipper Chip's encrypted keys, Ozzie is putting his trust in corporations, a decision that came from his experience in working for big companies like Lotus, IBM, and Microsoft. He was intimately familiar with the way that tech giants managed their keys. (You could even argue that he helped invent that structure, since Lotus Notes was the first software product to get a license to export strong encryption overseas and thus was able to build it into its products.) He argues that the security of the entire mobile universe already relies on the protection of keys-those vital keys used to verify operating system updates, whose compromise could put billions of users at risk. (Every time you do an OS update, Apple certifies it by adding a unique ID and \"signing\" it to let your device know it's really Apple that is rewriting your iPhone's code.) Using that same system to provide exceptional access, he says, introduces no new security weaknesses that vendors don't already deal with.</p><p>Ozzie knew that his proposal danced on the third rail of the crypto debate-many before him who had hinted at a technical solution to exceptional access have been greeted with social media pitchforks. So he decided to roll out his proposal quietly, showing Clear to small audiences under an informal nondisclosure agreement. The purpose was to get feedback on his system, and, if he was lucky, to jar some people out of the mindset that regarded exceptional access as a crime against science. His first stop, in September 2016, was in Seattle, where he met with his former colleagues at Microsoft. Bill Gates greeted the idea enthusiastically. Another former colleague, Butler Lampson-a winner of the Turing Award, the Nobel Prize of computer science-calls the approach \"completely reasonable &amp;#230; The idea that there's no way to engineer a secure way of access is ridiculous.\" (Microsoft has no formal comment.)</p><p>Ozzie went on to show Clear to representatives from several of the biggest tech companies-Apple, Google, Facebook-none of whom had any interest whatsoever in voluntarily implementing any sort of exceptional access. Their focus was to serve their customers, and their customers want security. (Or, as Facebook put it in a statement to WIRED: \"We have yet to hear of a technical solution to this challenge that would not risk weakening security for all users.\") At one company, Ozzie squared off against a technical person who found the proposal offensive. \"I've seen this happen to engineers a million times when they get backed into a corner,\" Ozzie says. \"I told him 'I'm not saying you <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> do this. I'm trying to refute the argument that it can't be done.' \"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Ozzie got an enthusiastic reception from the law enforcement and intelligence communities. \"It's not just whether his scheme is workable,\" says Rich Littlehale, a special agent in the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. \"It's the fact that someone with his experience and understanding is presenting it.\" In an informal meeting with NSA employees at its Maryland headquarters, Ozzie was startled to hear that the agency had come up with something almost identical at some point. They'd even given it a codename.</p><p>During the course of his meetings, Ozzie learned he was not alone in grappling with this issue. The names of three other scientists working on exceptional access popped up-Ernie Brickell, Stefan Savage, and Robert Thibadeau-and he thought it might be a good idea if they all met in private. Last August the four scientists gathered in Meg Whitman's boardroom at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Palo Alto. (Ozzie is a board member, and she let him borrow the space.) Though Thibadeau's work pursued a different course, Ozzie found that the other two were pursuing solutions similar to his. What's more, Savage has bona fides to rival Ozzie's. He's a world-renowned expert on security research, and he and Ozzie share the same motivations. \"We say we are scientists, and we let the data take us where they will, but not on this issue,\" Savage says. \"People I very much respect are saying this can't be done. That's not why I got into this business.\"</p><p>Ozzie's efforts come as the government is getting increasingly desperate to gain access to encrypted information. In a speech earlier this year, FBI director Christopher Wray said the agency was locked out of 7,775 devices in 2017. He declared the situation intolerable. \"I reject this notion that there could be such a place that no matter what kind of lawful authority you have, it's utterly beyond reach to protect innocent citizens,\" he said.</p><p>Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, in a speech at the Naval Academy late last year, was even more strident. \"Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety,\" he said. What's needed, he said, is \"responsible encryption &amp;#230; secure encryption that allows access only with judicial authorization.\"</p><p>Since Apple, Google, Facebook, and the rest don't see much upside in changing their systems, only a legislative demand could grant law enforcement exceptional access. But there doesn't seem to be much appetite in Congress to require tech companies to tailor their software to serve the needs of law enforcement agencies. That might change in the wake of some major incident, especially if it were discovered that advance notice might have been gleaned from an encrypted mobile device.</p><p>As an alternative to exceptional access, cryptographers and civil libertarians have begun promoting an approach known as lawful hacking. It turns out that there is a growing industry of private contractors who are skilled in identifying flaws in the systems that lock up information. In the San Bernardino case, the FBI paid a reported $900,000 to an unnamed contractor to help them access the data on Farook's iPhone. Many had suspected that the mysterious contractor was an Israeli company called Cellebrite, which has a thriving business in extracting data from iPhones for law enforcement agencies. (Cellebrite has refused to confirm or deny its involvement in the case, and its representatives declined to comment for this story.) A report by a think tank called the EastWest Institute concluded that other than exceptional access, lawful hacking is the only workable alternative.</p><p>But is it ethical? It seems odd to have security specialists promoting a system that depends on a reliable stream of vulnerabilities for hired hackers to exploit. Think about it: Apple can't access its customers' data-but some random company in Israel can fetch it for its paying customers? And with even the NSA unable to protect its own hacking tools, isn't it inevitable that the break-in secrets of these private companies will eventually fall into the hands of criminals and other bad actors? There is also a danger that forces within the big tech companies could enrich themselves through lawful hacking. As one law enforcement official pointed out to me, lawful hacking creates a marketplace for so-called zero-day flaws-vulnerabilities discovered by outsiders that the manufacturers don't know about-and thus can be exploited by legal and nonlegal attackers. So we shouldn't be surprised if malefactors inside tech companies create and bury these trapdoors in products, with hopes of selling them later to the \"lawful hackers.\"</p><p>Lawful hacking is techno-capitalism at its shadiest, and, in terms of security alone, it makes the mechanisms underlying Clear (court orders, tamper-proof contents) look that much more appealing. No matter where you stand in the crypto debate, it makes sense that a carefully considered means of implementing exceptional access would be far superior to a scheme that's hastily concocted in the aftermath of a disaster. (See Clipper.) But such an approach goes nowhere unless people believe that it doesn't violate math, physics, and Tim Cook's vows to his customers. That is the bar that Ozzie hopes he can clear.</p><p>The \"Keys Under Doormats\" gang has raised some good criticisms of Clear, and for the record, they resent Ozzie's implication that their minds are closed. \"The answer is always, show me a proposal that doesn't harm security,\" says Dan Boneh, a celebrated cryptographer who teaches at Stanford. \"How do we balance that against the legitimate need of security to unlock phones? I wish I could tell you.\"</p><p>One of the most salient objections goes to the heart of Ozzie's claim that his system doesn't really increase risk to a user's privacy, because manufacturers like Apple already employ intricate protocols to protect the keys that verify its operating system updates. Ozzie's detractors reject the equivalence. \"The exceptional access key is different from the signing key,\" says Susan Landau, a computer scientist who was also a coauthor of the \"Doormat\" paper. \"A signing key is used rarely, but the exceptional access key will be used a lot.\" The implication is that setting up a system to protect the PINs of billions of phones, and process thousands of requests from law enforcement, will inevitably have huge gaps in security. Ozzie says this really isn't a problem. Invoking his experience as a top executive at major tech firms, he says that they already have frameworks that can securely handle keys at scale. Apple, for example, uses a key system so that thousands of developers can be verified as genuine-the iOS ecosystem couldn't work otherwise.</p><p>Ozzie has fewer answers to address criticisms about how his system-or any that uses exceptional access-would work internationally. Would every country, even those with authoritarian governments, be able to compel Apple or Google to cough up the key to unlock the contents of any device within its jurisdiction? Ozzie concedes that's a legitimate concern, and it's part of the larger ongoing debate about how we regulate the flow of information and intellectual property across borders. He is also the first to point out that he doesn't have all the answers about exceptional access, and he isn't trying to create a full legal and technological framework. He is merely trying to prove that something could work.</p><p>Maybe that's where Ozzie's plan plunges into the choppiest waters. Proving something is nigh impossible in the world of crypto and security. Time and again, supposedly impervious systems, created by the most brilliant cryptographers and security specialists, get undermined by clever attackers, and sometimes just idiots who stumble on unforeseen weaknesses. \"Security is not perfect,\" says Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins. \"We're really bad at it.\"</p><p>But as bad as security can be, we rely on it anyway. What's the alternative? We trust it to protect our phone updates, our personal information, and now even cryptocurrencies. All too often, it fails. What Ozzie is saying is that exceptional access is no different. It isn't a special case singled out by the math gods. If we agree that a relatively benign scheme is possible, then we can debate whether we should do it on the grounds of policy.</p><p>Maybe we'd even decide that we don't want exceptional access, given all the other tools government has to snoop on us. Ozzie could return to his post-economic retirement, and law enforcement and civil libertarians would return to their respective corners, ready to slug it out another day. Let the Crypto Wars continue.</p><p>A Brief History of the Crypto Wars 1976: Scientists introduce public key cryptography, in which private and public complementary keys are used to encrypt and unlock data. 1982: RSA becomes one of the first companies to market encryption to the business and consumer world. 1989: Lotus Notes becomes the first software to obtain a license to export strong encryption overseas. 1993: The Clinton administration announces a plan to use the so-called Clipper Chip. 1994: A computer scientist finds a critical vulner-ability in the Clipper Chip.

The shooters were tracked down and killed later in the day, and FBI agents wasted no time trying to understand the motivations of Farook and to get the fullest possible sense of his contacts and his network. But there was a problem: Farook's iPhone 5c was protected by Apple's default encryption system. Even when served with a warrant, Apple did not have the ability to extract the information from its own product.</p><p>The government filed a court order, demanding, essentially, that Apple create a new version of the operating system that would enable it to unlock that single iPhone. Apple def nded itself, with CEO Tim Cook framing the request as a threat to individual liberty.</p><p>\"We have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy,\" he said in a press conference. Then-FBI chief James Comey reportedly warned that Cook's attitude could cost lives. \"I just don't want to get to a day where people look at us with tears in their eyes and say, 'My daughter is missing and you have her cell phone-what do you mean you can't tell me who she was texting before she disappeared?' \" The controversy over Farook's iPhone reignited a debate that was known in the 1990s as the Crypto Wars, when the government feared the world was \"going dark\" and tried-and ultimately failed-to impede the adoption of technologies that could encode people's information. Only this time, with supercomputers in everybody's pockets and the endless war on terror, the stakes were higher than ever.</p><p>A few months after the San Bernardino shooting, President Obama sat for an interview at the South by Southwest conference and argued that government officials must be given some kind of shortcut-or what's known as exceptional access-to encrypted content during criminal and antiterrorism investigations. \"My conclusion so far is that you cannot take an absolutist view on this,\" he said. \"If the tech community says, 'Either we have strong, perfect encryption or else it's Big Brother and an Orwellian world'-what you'll find is that after something really bad happens, the politics of this will swing and it will become sloppy and rushed, and it will go through Congress in ways that have not been thought through. And then you really will have dangers to our civil liberties.\"</p><p>In typical Obama fashion, the president was leaning toward a compromise, a grand bargain between those who insist that the NSA and FBI need all the information they can get to monitor potential terrorists or zero in on child abusers and those who believe building any sort of exceptional access into our phones would be a fast track to a totalitarian surveillance state. And like so many of Obama's proposed compromises, this one went nowhere. To many cryptographers, there was simply no way that companies like Apple and Google could provide the government with legal access to customer data without compromising personal privacy and even national security. Exceptional access was a form of technology, after all, and any of its inevitable glitches, flaws, or bugs could be exploited to catastrophic ends. To suggest otherwise, they argued, was flat wrong. Flat-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Earth</emphasis> wrong. Which was, as any good engineer or designer knows, an open invitation for someone to prove them wrong.</p><p>This past January, Ray Ozzie took a train from his home in Massachusetts to New York City for a meeting in a conference room of the Data Science Institute at Columbia University. The 14th-floor aerie was ringed by wide windows and looked out on a clear but chilly day. About 15 people sat around the conference table, most of them middle-aged academics-people from the law school, scholars in government policy, and computer scientists, including cryptographers and security specialists-nibbling on a light lunch while waiting for Ozzie's presentation to begin.</p><p>Jeannette Wing-the host of the meeting and a former corporate VP of Microsoft Research who now heads the Data Science Institute-introduced Ozzie to the group. In the invitation to this \"private, informal session,\" she'd referenced his background, albeit briefly. Ozzie was once chief technical officer at Microsoft as well as its chief software architect, posts he had assumed after leaving IBM, where he'd gone to work after the company had purchased a product he created, Lotus Notes. Packed in that sentence was the stuff of legend: Notes was a groundbreaking product that rocketed businesses into internet-style communications when the internet was barely a thing. The only other person who ever held the chief software architect post at Microsoft was Bill Gates, and Ozzie had also helped create the company's cloud business.</p><p>He had come to Columbia with a proposal to address the impasse over exceptional access, and the host invited the group to \"critique it in a constructive way.\" Ozzie, trim and vigorous at 62, acknowledged off the bat that he was dealing with a polarizing issue. The cryptographic and civil liberties community argued that solving the problem was virtually impossible, which \"kind of bothers me,\" he said. \"In engineering if you think hard enough, you can come up with a solution.\" He believed he had one.</p><p>He started his presentation, outlining a scheme that would give law enforcement access to encrypted data without significantly increasing security risks for the billions of people who use encrypted devices. He'd named his idea Clear.</p><p>It works this way: The vendor-say it's Apple in this case, but it could be Google or any other tech company-starts by generating a pair of complementary keys. One, called the vendor's \"public key,\" is stored in every iPhone and iPad. The other vendor key is its \"private key.\" That one is stored with Apple, protected with the same maniacal care that Apple uses to protect the secret keys that certify its operating system updates. These safety measures typically involve a tamper-proof machine (known as an HSM or hardware security module) that lives in a vault in a specially protected building under biometric lock and smartcard key.</p><p>That public and private key pair can be used to encrypt and decrypt a secret PIN that each user's device automatically generates upon activation. Think of it as an extra password to unlock the device. This secret PIN is stored on the device, and it's protected by encrypting it with the vendor's public key. Once this is done, no one can decode it and use the PIN to unlock the phone except the vendor, using that highly protected private key.</p><p>So, say the FBI needs the contents of an iPhone. First the Feds have to actually get the device and the proper court authorization to access the information it contains-Ozzie's system does not allow the authorities to remotely snatch information. With the phone in its possession, they could then access, through the lock screen, the encrypted PIN and send it to Apple. Armed with that information, Apple would send highly trusted employees into the vault where they could use the private key to unlock the PIN. Apple could then send that no-longer-secret PIN back to the government, who can use it to unlock the device.</p><p>Ozzie designed other features meant to reassure skeptics. Clear works on only one device at a time: Obtaining one phone's PIN would not give the authorities the means to crack anyone else's phone. Also, when a phone is unlocked with Clear, a special chip inside the phone blows itself up, freezing the contents of the phone thereafter. This prevents any tampering with the contents of the phone. Clear can't be used for ongoing surveillance, Ozzie told the Columbia group, because once it is employed, the phone would no longer be able to be used.</p><p>He waited for the questions, and for the next two hours, there were plenty of them. The word <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">risk</emphasis> came up. The most dramatic comment came from computer science professor and cryptographer Eran Tromer. With the flair of Hercule Poirot revealing the murderer, he announced that he'd discovered a weakness. He spun a wild scenario involving a stolen phone, a second hacked phone, and a bank robbery. Ozzie conceded that Tromer found a flaw, but not one that couldn't be fixed.</p><p>At the end of the meeting, Ozzie felt he'd gotten some good feedback. He might not have changed anyone's position, but he also knew that unlocking minds can be harder than unlocking an encrypted iPhone. Still, he'd taken another baby step in what is now a two-years-and- counting quest. By focusing on the engineering problem, he'd started to change the debate about how best to balance privacy and law enforcement access. \"I do not want us to hide behind a technological smoke screen,\" he said that day at Columbia. \"Let's debate it. Don't hide the fact that it might be possible.\"</p><p>The first, and most famous, exceptional-access scheme was codenamed Nirvana. Its creator was an NSA assistant deputy director named Clinton Brooks, who realized in the late 1980s that newly discovered advances in cryptography could be a disaster for law enforcement and intelligence agencies. After initial despair, Brooks came up with an idea that he envisioned would protect people's privacy while preserving government's ability to get vital information. It involved generating a set of encryption keys, unique to each device, that would be held by government in heavily protected escrow. Only with legal warrants could the keys be retrieved and then used to decode encrypted data. Everyone would get what they wanted. Thus &amp;#230; Nirvana.</p><p>The plan was spectacularly botched. Brooks' intent was to slowly cook up an impervious technical framework and carefully introduce it in the context of a broad and serious national discussion about encryption policy, where all stakeholders would hash out the relative trade-offs of law enforcement access to information and privacy. But in 1992, AT&amp;T developed the Telephone Security Device 3600, which could scramble phone conversations. Its strong encryption and relatively low price unleashed a crypto panic in the NSA, the FBI, and even the tech-friendly officials in the new Clinton administration. Then the idea came up of using Brooks' key escrow technology, which by that time was being implemented with a specialized component called the Clipper Chip, to combat these enhanced encryption systems. After a few weeks, the president himself agreed to the plan, announcing it on April 16, 1993.</p><p>All hell broke loose as technologists and civil libertarians warned of an Orwellian future in which the government possessed a backdoor to all our information. Suddenly the obscure field of cryptography became a hot button. (I still have a T-shirt with the rallying cry \"Don't Give Big Brother a Master Key.\") And very good questions were raised: How could tech companies sell their wares overseas if foreign customers knew the US could get into their stuff? Wouldn't actual criminals use other alternatives to encrypt data? Would Clipper Chip technology, moving at government speed, hobble the fast-moving tech world?</p><p>Ultimately, Clipper's death came not from policy, but science. A young Bell Labs cryptographer named Matt Blaze discovered a fatal vulnerability, undoubtedly an artifact of the system's rushed implementation. Blaze's hack led the front page of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>. The fiasco tainted all subsequent attempts at installing government backdoors, and by 1999, most government efforts to regulate cryptography had been abandoned, with barely a murmur from the FBI or the NSA.</p><p>For the next dozen or so years, there seemed to be a Pax Cryptographa. You seldom heard the government complain about not having enough access to people's personal information. But that was in large part because the government already had a frightening abundance of access, a fact made clear in 2013 by Edward Snowden. When the NSA contractor revealed the extent of his employer's surveillance capabilities, people were shocked at the breadth of its activities. Massive snooping programs were sweeping up our \"metadata\"-who we talk to, where we go-while court orders allowed investigators to scour what we stored in the cloud. The revelations were also a visceral blow to the leaders of the big tech companies, who discovered that their customers' data had essentially been plundered at the source. They vowed to protect that data more assiduously, this time regarding the US government as one of their attackers. Their solution: encryption that even the companies themselves could not decode. The best example was the iPhone, which encrypted users' data by default with iOS 8 in 2014.</p><p>Law enforcement officials, most notably Comey of the FBI, grew alarmed that these heightened encryption schemes would create a safe haven for crooks and terrorists. He directed his staff to look at the potential dangers of increasing encryption and began giving speeches that called for that blast from the past, lingering like a nasty chord from '90s grunge: exceptional access.</p><p>The response from the cryptographic community was swift and simple: Can't. Be. Done. In a landmark 2015 paper called \"Keys Under Doormats,\" a group of 15 cryptographers and computer security experts argued that, while law enforcement has reasons to argue for access to encrypted data, \"a careful scientific analysis of the likely impact of such demands must distinguish what might be desirable from what is technically possible.\" Their analysis claimed that there was no foreseeable way to do this. If the government tried to implement exceptional access, they wrote, it would \"open doors through which criminals and malicious nation-states can attack the very individuals law enforcement seeks to defend.\"</p><p>The 1990s Crypto Wars were back on, and Ray Ozzie didn't like what he was hearing. The debate was becoming increasingly politicized. Experts in cryptography, he says, \"were starting to pat themselves on the back, taking extreme positions about truisms that weren't so obvious to me.\" He knew that great achievements of cryptography had come from brilliant scientists using encryption protocols to perform a kind of magic: sharing secrets between two people who had never met, or creating digital currency that can't be duplicated for the purposes of fraud. Could a secure system of exceptional access be so much harder?</p><p>So Ozzie set out to crack the problem. He had the time to do it. He'd recently sold a company he founded in 2012, Talko, to Microsoft. And he was, to quote a friend, \"post-economic,\" having made enough money to free him from financial concerns. Working out of his home north of Boston, he began to fool around with some ideas. About two weeks later, he came up with Clear.</p><p>The strength of Ozzie's system lies in its simplicity. Unlike Clinton Brooks, who relied on the government to safeguard the Clipper Chip's encrypted keys, Ozzie is putting his trust in corporations, a decision that came from his experience in working for big companies like Lotus, IBM, and Microsoft. He was intimately familiar with the way that tech giants managed their keys. (You could even argue that he helped invent that structure, since Lotus Notes was the first software product to get a license to export strong encryption overseas and thus was able to build it into its products.) He argues that the security of the entire mobile universe already relies on the protection of keys-those vital keys used to verify operating system updates, whose compromise could put billions of users at risk. (Every time you do an OS update, Apple certifies it by adding a unique ID and \"signing\" it to let your device know it's really Apple that is rewriting your iPhone's code.) Using that same system to provide exceptional access, he says, introduces no new security weaknesses that vendors don't already deal with.</p><p>Ozzie knew that his proposal danced on the third rail of the crypto debate-many before him who had hinted at a technical solution to exceptional access have been greeted with social media pitchforks. So he decided to roll out his proposal quietly, showing Clear to small audiences under an informal nondisclosure agreement. The purpose was to get feedback on his system, and, if he was lucky, to jar some people out of the mindset that regarded exceptional access as a crime against science. His first stop, in September 2016, was in Seattle, where he met with his former colleagues at Microsoft. Bill Gates greeted the idea enthusiastically. Another former colleague, Butler Lampson-a winner of the Turing Award, the Nobel Prize of computer science-calls the approach \"completely reasonable &amp;#230; The idea that there's no way to engineer a secure way of access is ridiculous.\" (Microsoft has no formal comment.)</p><p>Ozzie went on to show Clear to representatives from several of the biggest tech companies-Apple, Google, Facebook-none of whom had any interest whatsoever in voluntarily implementing any sort of exceptional access. Their focus was to serve their customers, and their customers want security. (Or, as Facebook put it in a statement to WIRED: \"We have yet to hear of a technical solution to this challenge that would not risk weakening security for all users.\") At one company, Ozzie squared off against a technical person who found the proposal offensive. \"I've seen this happen to engineers a million times when they get backed into a corner,\" Ozzie says. \"I told him 'I'm not saying you <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> do this. I'm trying to refute the argument that it can't be done.' \"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Ozzie got an enthusiastic reception from the law enforcement and intelligence communities. \"It's not just whether his scheme is workable,\" says Rich Littlehale, a special agent in the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. \"It's the fact that someone with his experience and understanding is presenting it.\" In an informal meeting with NSA employees at its Maryland headquarters, Ozzie was startled to hear that the agency had come up with something almost identical at some point. They'd even given it a codename.</p><p>During the course of his meetings, Ozzie learned he was not alone in grappling with this issue. The names of three other scientists working on exceptional access popped up-Ernie Brickell, Stefan Savage, and Robert Thibadeau-and he thought it might be a good idea if they all met in private. Last August the four scientists gathered in Meg Whitman's boardroom at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Palo Alto. (Ozzie is a board member, and she let him borrow the space.) Though Thibadeau's work pursued a different course, Ozzie found that the other two were pursuing solutions similar to his. What's more, Savage has bona fides to rival Ozzie's. He's a world-renowned expert on security research, and he and Ozzie share the same motivations. \"We say we are scientists, and we let the data take us where they will, but not on this issue,\" Savage says. \"People I very much respect are saying this can't be done. That's not why I got into this business.\"</p><p>Ozzie's efforts come as the government is getting increasingly desperate to gain access to encrypted information. In a speech earlier this year, FBI director Christopher Wray said the agency was locked out of 7,775 devices in 2017. He declared the situation intolerable. \"I reject this notion that there could be such a place that no matter what kind of lawful authority you have, it's utterly beyond reach to protect innocent citizens,\" he said.</p><p>Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, in a speech at the Naval Academy late last year, was even more strident. \"Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety,\" he said. What's needed, he said, is \"responsible encryption &amp;#230; secure encryption that allows access only with judicial authorization.\"</p><p>Since Apple, Google, Facebook, and the rest don't see much upside in changing their systems, only a legislative demand could grant law enforcement exceptional access. But there doesn't seem to be much appetite in Congress to require tech companies to tailor their software to serve the needs of law enforcement agencies. That might change in the wake of some major incident, especially if it were discovered that advance notice might have been gleaned from an encrypted mobile device.</p><p>As an alternative to exceptional access, cryptographers and civil libertarians have begun promoting an approach known as lawful hacking. It turns out that there is a growing industry of private contractors who are skilled in identifying flaws in the systems that lock up information. In the San Bernardino case, the FBI paid a reported $900,000 to an unnamed contractor to help them access the data on Farook's iPhone. Many had suspected that the mysterious contractor was an Israeli company called Cellebrite, which has a thriving business in extracting data from iPhones for law enforcement agencies. (Cellebrite has refused to confirm or deny its involvement in the case, and its representatives declined to comment for this story.) A report by a think tank called the EastWest Institute concluded that other than exceptional access, lawful hacking is the only workable alternative.</p><p>But is it ethical? It seems odd to have security specialists promoting a system that depends on a reliable stream of vulnerabilities for hired hackers to exploit. Think about it: Apple can't access its customers' data-but some random company in Israel can fetch it for its paying customers? And with even the NSA unable to protect its own hacking tools, isn't it inevitable that the break-in secrets of these private companies will eventually fall into the hands of criminals and other bad actors? There is also a danger that forces within the big tech companies could enrich themselves through lawful hacking. As one law enforcement official pointed out to me, lawful hacking creates a marketplace for so-called zero-day flaws-vulnerabilities discovered by outsiders that the manufacturers don't know about-and thus can be exploited by legal and nonlegal attackers. So we shouldn't be surprised if malefactors inside tech companies create and bury these trapdoors in products, with hopes of selling them later to the \"lawful hackers.\"</p><p>Lawful hacking is techno-capitalism at its shadiest, and, in terms of security alone, it makes the mechanisms underlying Clear (court orders, tamper-proof contents) look that much more appealing. No matter where you stand in the crypto debate, it makes sense that a carefully considered means of implementing exceptional access would be far superior to a scheme that's hastily concocted in the aftermath of a disaster. (See Clipper.) But such an approach goes nowhere unless people believe that it doesn't violate math, physics, and Tim Cook's vows to his customers. That is the bar that Ozzie hopes he can clear.</p><p>The \"Keys Under Doormats\" gang has raised some good criticisms of Clear, and for the record, they resent Ozzie's implication that their minds are closed. \"The answer is always, show me a proposal that doesn't harm security,\" says Dan Boneh, a celebrated cryptographer who teaches at Stanford. \"How do we balance that against the legitimate need of security to unlock phones? I wish I could tell you.\"</p><p>One of the most salient objections goes to the heart of Ozzie's claim that his system doesn't really increase risk to a user's privacy, because manufacturers like Apple already employ intricate protocols to protect the keys that verify its operating system updates. Ozzie's detractors reject the equivalence. \"The exceptional access key is different from the signing key,\" says Susan Landau, a computer scientist who was also a coauthor of the \"Doormat\" paper. \"A signing key is used rarely, but the exceptional access key will be used a lot.\" The implication is that setting up a system to protect the PINs of billions of phones, and process thousands of requests from law enforcement, will inevitably have huge gaps in security. Ozzie says this really isn't a problem. Invoking his experience as a top executive at major tech firms, he says that they already have frameworks that can securely handle keys at scale. Apple, for example, uses a key system so that thousands of developers can be verified as genuine-the iOS ecosystem couldn't work otherwise.</p><p>Ozzie has fewer answers to address criticisms about how his system-or any that uses exceptional access-would work internationally. Would every country, even those with authoritarian governments, be able to compel Apple or Google to cough up the key to unlock the contents of any device within its jurisdiction? Ozzie concedes that's a legitimate concern, and it's part of the larger ongoing debate about how we regulate the flow of information and intellectual property across borders. He is also the first to point out that he doesn't have all the answers about exceptional access, and he isn't trying to create a full legal and technological framework. He is merely trying to prove that something could work.</p><p>Maybe that's where Ozzie's plan plunges into the choppiest waters. Proving something is nigh impossible in the world of crypto and security. Time and again, supposedly impervious systems, created by the most brilliant cryptographers and security specialists, get undermined by clever attackers, and sometimes just idiots who stumble on unforeseen weaknesses. \"Security is not perfect,\" says Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins. \"We're really bad at it.\"</p><p>But as bad as security can be, we rely on it anyway. What's the alternative? We trust it to protect our phone updates, our personal information, and now even cryptocurrencies. All too often, it fails. What Ozzie is saying is that exceptional access is no different. It isn't a special case singled out by the math gods. If we agree that a relatively benign scheme is possible, then we can debate whether we should do it on the grounds of policy.</p><p>Maybe we'd even decide that we don't want exceptional access, given all the other tools government has to snoop on us. Ozzie could return to his post-economic retirement, and law enforcement and civil libertarians would return to their respective corners, ready to slug it out another day. Let the Crypto Wars continue.</p><p>A Brief History of the Crypto Wars 1976: Scientists introduce public key cryptography, in which private and public complementary keys are used to encrypt and unlock data. 1982: RSA becomes one of the first companies to market encryption to the business and consumer world. 1989: Lotus Notes becomes the first software to obtain a license to export strong encryption overseas. 1993: The Clinton administration announces a plan to use the so-called Clipper Chip. 1994: A computer scientist finds a critical vulner-ability in the Clipper Chip.

They include railways, coal mining, electricity, gas, iron and steel and civil aviation industries, telecommunications, the Bank of England and of course healthcare, which led to the formation of the NHS. All of this was done by the Attlee Labour government in the late 1940s. </p><p>Critics of nationalisation say that it stifles innovation and investment in research, while driving up prices to consumers compared to the open marketplace.</p><p>They point to frequent strikes by public-sector, unionised workers - the scars of the Miners' Strike in 1984-5 are still visible in communities across the North. </p><p>People who grew up with BT as a public utility point to a lack of choice and poor customer services - including waiting weeks for lines to be installed.</p><p>British Rail was also notorious for being badly run and not friendly to commuters. </p><p>Publicly owned firms can also swallow up large amounts of taxpayers' money, as loss-making industries are not allowed to fail, often being propped up for political reasons because Governments get blamed for job losses.</p><p>Sell-offs have happened at various points but they sped up after Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979 promising deregulation. </p><p>Her government privatised British Telecom, British Aerospace, British Airways, British Gas and the British Steel Corporation among others. </p><p>Her successor John Major privatised British Rail. </p><p>But by the time Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997 not many remained in public hands. </p><p>Most recently the Government sold its last shares in Royal Mail as recently as 2015, having floated it it in 2013. </p><p> Markets also panicked at the prospect of the nationalisation of private assets in which millions of people have shares, TalkTalk immediately put the sale of its full fibre broadband business, FibreNation, on hold.</p><p>Shares in BT dived around 2 per cent this morning as traders digested the implications. And the CBI warned that business would be thinking 'who is next' for being taken into public ownership. </p><p>Mr Johnson branded the plan a 'crackpot scheme' that will 'involve many many billions of taxpayers' money nationalising a British business'. </p><p>Critics also pointed out that Labour was holding up South Korea as an example of how the scheme could work - but in fact while the government in Seoul did carry out central planning, private firms were involved in provision. </p><p>Former Labour frontbencher Chris Leslie jibed that the party was pursuing 'mass nationalisation for ideological reasons'. 'Why not throw in free Sky TV? Free iPhones?' he said. </p><p>At an event in Lancaster today, Mr Corbyn said British Broadband could be a 'treasured public institution for the 21st Century'. He said 'only the government has the planning ability and the economy of scale to take this on'. </p><p>Mr McDonnell accepted that the sweeping project - which confirms the clearest electoral dividing lines between Labour and the Tories since the 1980s - was 'visionary'.</p><p>But he insisted it could be achieved, saying he would impose a new tax on big tech multinationals to meet running costs. </p><p>He also shrugged off claims he wants to go even further in taking powers for the state - after he said previously that nationalising rail, water and power was the 'limit of my ambitions'. </p><p>Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The proposal is to take over OpenReach from BT, establish British Broadband, within that have an infrastructure group as well as a broadband service group, and in that way we then start out the roll out itself.'</p><p>Mr McDonnell continued: 'Yes, it is ambitious, but we have to be ambitious if we're going to compete in the global economy.' </p><p>Mr McDonnell said BT shareholders would be given government bonds in return for OpenReach being nationalised - with Parliament setting the price.</p><p>When it was pointed out that government bonds currently have a 2 per cent return rather than the 7 return for BT shares, he said they were more stable.</p><p>                     TalkTalk puts broadband sale on hold after Labour shock                    </p><p> TalkTalk has put the sale of its full fibre broadband business, FibreNation, on hold after the Labour Party announced plans to turn broadband into a free public service.</p><p>The company's half-year results were delayed on Tuesday as it was close to completing a deal for FibreNation, but the sale was paused on Friday after Labour announced plans to nationalise parts of BT.</p><p>'Not surprisingly, when news of that sort lands, everybody's reviewing, pausing for breath, and considering what that means, and that's what happened here,' chief executive Tristia Harrison told the PA news agency.</p><p>'We are in extremely advanced discussions and negotiations,' she added. 'We're just pausing and reconsidering.'</p><p>Ms Harrison said her team has been pleased with the level of interest in the business and is still speaking to several potential buyers, though she declined to name them.</p><p>'There's a lot to consider, lots to digest, I think the whole industry is just considering what happens next; from our point of view we've been very focused on the (company) results,' Ms Harrison said.</p><p>In those results, TalkTalk revealed that more customers are plumping for its higher broadband speeds as it added nearly 300,000 new fibre accounts to the business over the last six months.</p><p>Almost a quarter - 23 per cent - of TalkTalk customers chose a deal which gives them 80 megabits per second in the second quarter of the year, up from 17 per cent in same period last year.</p><p>'I don't believe anyone will lose out on this,' he said. </p><p>Asked what would happen to firms like Virgin Media, Sky and TalkTalk - which have invested large sums in broadband provision - Mr McDonnell suggested they would be nationalised if they did not bow to the new arrangements.</p><p>'We will come to an agreement with them. It will either be an agreement of access arrangements, or working alongside us, or yes if necessary they can then come within the ambit of British Broadband,' he said.</p><p>'I think we can come to an agreement, but if necessary - they are only 10 per cent of the market.' </p><p>Mr McDonnell made clear that would also involve Parliament setting the price and swapping shares for government bonds.</p><p>'Yes, if necessary there will be elements of compensation, but that will be subject to negotiation,' he said. </p><p>BT Chief Executive Philip Jansen told the BBC: 'These are very, very ambitious ideas and the Conservative Party have their own ambitious idea for full fibre for everyone by 2025 and how we do it is not straight forward.</p><p>'It needs funding, it is very big numbers, so we are talking \u00a330-to-\u00a340billion ... and if you are giving it away over an eight year time frame it is a another \u00a330 or \u00a340billion. You are not short of \u00a3100billion.'</p><p>James Lusher, Virgin Media's head of external communications, made his views on Labour's broadband policy clear by tweeting a gif of a raccoon stealing food from a cat bowl, captioned with the words: 'This mine now.' </p><p>TalkTalk chief executive Tristia Harrison said: 'Not surprisingly, when news of that sort lands, everybody's reviewing, pausing for breath, and considering what that means, and that's what happened here.</p><p>'We are in extremely advanced discussions and negotiations,' she added. 'We're just pausing and reconsidering.' </p><p>Matthew Fell, the CBI's Chief UK Policy Director, said fast reliable broadband was an 'absolute priority for people and firms and does need improving'. </p><p>But he cautioned that Labour's plan was 'not the way to do it'. </p><p>                     What did South Korea do on broadband?                    </p><p> Improving broadband coverage and speeds has become a big priority for both the Tories and Labour.</p><p>Only 8 per cent of UK premises are connected to full-fibre broadband, compared to 98 per cent in South Korea.</p><p>John McDonnell hailed Seoul as an example of how his 'vision' could work today,</p><p>But in fact, while the South Korea government played a very active role in planning and investing in broadband upgrades, it used private firms to implement changes, </p><p>According to a World Bank factsheet on the scheme, the government there 'actively supports the businesses building the network by creating the regulatory framework and making a lead investment'. </p><p>'The roll out of full fibre broadband across the country is underway, and all renationalisation will achieve is to slow down a process that needs speeding up,' he said.</p><p>'It is private sector investment that has driven connectivity, massively widened internet access and put faster speeds within reach for most UK households. This progress will be stopped in its tracks and the bill passed to pensioners and savers.</p><p>'With so many challenges facing the UK, blinkered ideologies must be left behind and replaced by forward-looking public-private partnerships that deliver rather than delay.</p><p>'As the scope of Labour's radical renationalisation plans expands almost daily, firms around the world lose confidence in the UK as a place to invest safely. Some will be asking if they are next. This threat damages the livelihoods of communities across the country.' </p><p>Mr McDonnell was forced to deny claims that the bold move could fall foul of EU rules against subsidising industries. </p><p>Meanwhile, there are concerns about the taxpayer taking on the burden of BT's estimated \u00a34.5billion pension deficit.</p><p>Three years ago Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, cited the pensions deficit as a reason not to break up BT and it could mean 'very significant costs'. </p><p>Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan mocked the 'fantasy plan' to roll-out fibre for all by 2030.</p><p>'Corbyn is clearly so desperate to distract from his party's divisions on Brexit and immigration that he will promise anything, regardless of the cost to taxpayers and whether it can actually be delivered. What reckless idea will be next?' Ms Morgan said. </p><p>Chief Executive Philip Jansen told the Financial Times that 'free broadband for all' was superficially attractive but needed to be thought through.</p><p>Neil McRae, the chief network architect at the firm, tweeted: 'Labour plans broadband communism!'</p><p>The splurge rivals a comparatively modest pledge by Boris Johnson to spend \u00a35billion to get fibre optic broadband into every home.</p><p>According to a report by Ofcom only around seven percent of homes in the UK have access to fibre.</p><p>The average household pays roughly \u00a330 per month for their broadband, around \u00a3360 each year that Labour say they will do away with.</p><p>Launching the policy at Lancaster University, Mr Corbyn vowed not to transfer the costs to the public, 'who have already forked out far too much for rip-off broadband'.</p><p>'Instead, a Labour government will close down tax tricks used by giants like Google and Facebook, who make millions in this country while paying next to nothing to the public services which they benefit from,' he said.</p><p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed Mr Jansen's figure, saying Labour's numbers had come from the Government's own digital infrastructure review.</p><p>'So we have taken that figure, a Government figure, independently assessed, and that's the basis of which we will be delivering the project itself,' Mr McDonnell said.</p><p>'They think they can get away with not paying their share, well I've got news for them - not any more.'</p><p>Mr Corbyn pledged the move would end internet dropouts, improve national security, form part of its 'green industrial revolution' to tackle climate change by reducing the need to commute and save the average person \u00a330.30 a month.</p><p>Mr McDonnell said the maintenance costs of the network - around \u00a3230 million yearly - would be paid for by a new approach to taxing multinationals as a share of their global activity.</p><p>If they have 10% of their 'sales, workforce and operations' in the UK then they would pay \u00a310 of their global profits, Mr McDonnell explained.</p><p>He denied the nationalisation plan was a return to the 1970s, instead hailing it as 'public ownership of the future'.</p><p>Boris Johnson has previously planned to give every home in the UK full-fibre internet by 2025 with a \u00a35 billion spend but on Friday he downgraded this to 'gigabit broadband' without a deadline, and he called Labour's scheme 'crackpot'.</p><p>Mr McDonnell criticised the Tory's plans as a 'fat subsidy to existing operators like Virgin'.</p><p>The Shadow Chancellor claims this is nowhere near enough infrastructure and said he was inundated with complaints about the state of the internet while travelling throughout the country. </p><p>                     What is fibre-optic broadband?                   </p><p>Fibre optic cables involve tiny tubes that are about as thick as a human hair and are reflective on the inside.</p><p>They transfer information by sending flashes of light through the tubes.</p><p>This bounces off the reflective walls and along the cable. </p><p>These flashes of data are then received and interpreted at the other end. </p><p>'Apart from some parts of London, and some of our major cities, everywhere I go they're saying: 'Oh, we've either not got broadband at the speeds that we need, it's holding our economy back.'' He told the BBC.</p><p>Labour has already announced it will nationalise water and rail, but Mr McDonnell said they would draw the line at broadband.</p><p>'It is the the limit of our ambitions,' he told the broadcaster.</p><p>The new company, British Broadband, would cost \u00a3230million to run, Mr McDonnell claimed, and that cost would be covered by Labour's multinationals tax.</p><p>The party will also announce plans for a new Charter of Digital Rights, describing it as 'the strongest protection of data and online rights ever enacted'.</p><p>They said they will consult on its contents, which could include powers for individuals and collectives to challenge algorithmic injustice, powers for individuals and collectives to prevent the use of digital infrastructure for surveillance, and rights for individuals to protect access to and ownership of their data. </p><p>The UK lags behind some of our European counterparts in terms of infrastructure, a gap which has been acknowledged by both of the main parties. </p><p>                     Boris Johnson offers \u00a3500m to reopen rail lines closed by Beeching and \u00a3150m to revitalise high streets in bid to woo voters in northern Leave-backing seats who feel 'left behind'                   </p><p>                     Boris Johnson will today promise to spend \u00a3500million on reopening rail lines axed in the notorious Beeching closures of the Sixties.</p><p>The 'Beeching reversal fund' will be spent on reconnecting branch lines to towns cut off from the rail network.</p><p>It forms part of a package of support aimed at communities that Mr Johnson said had been 'left behind.'</p><p>The pledge will also be seen as a pitch to parts of the Midlands and the North, where the Tories believe they can win over Leave voters from Labour at next month's election.</p><p>British Rail chairman Dr Richard Beeching was commissioned in the early Sixties to review the loss-making railways. As a result, a third of Britain's 18,000 miles of track were axed. </p><p>Mr Johnson said: 'Too many towns and villages across Britain have been overlooked and left behind.</p><p>'When the UK voted to leave the EU, many communities felt their voices had been heard for the first time in decades. We will invest in these communities and help people put the heart back into the places they call home. </p><p>'We need to get Brexit done so that we can unleash the potential of all our towns, cities and villages.</p><p>'We will be able to save our high streets, keep pubs and post offices open and re-connect places to the rail network half a century after they were cut off.'</p><p>The Prime Minister announced a package of measures, including cutting business rates for shops, cinemas and pubs, designed to help places which have not always benefited from economic growth. </p><p>Towns are to be promised a share of a \u00a3150million pot that will include a 50 percent discount on business rates for small businesses. </p><p>The millions will back community groups who want to buy their local pubs and post offices and give a nine month ban on sale to other bidders. </p><p>The Tories said up to half a million businesses will benefit, with the discount extended to all cinemas and music venues. </p><p>The average corner shop will get a \u00a31,400 cut in their business rates from the extension in the retail discount.</p><p>Mr Johnson is also pledging \u00a31,000-a-year discount to pubs as part of the package. </p><p>There are also plans to invest in cycling and walking with the aim of making it easier for people to cycle and walk around their local areas. </p><p>Andrew Gwynne, Labour's shadow communities secretary, said: 'The Tories are destroying our high streets and towns.</p><p>'A decade of vicious cuts to the services that people in our communities rely on, has taken 60p in every \u00a31 from council budgets.</p><p>'There is a clear choice in this election on December 12: more of the same with Boris Johnson's Tories or real change and investment under Labour.' </p><p>                     Brussels sues UK and threatens enormous daily fines as Boris Johnson refuses to name an EU Commissioner despite Brexit being delayed                    </p><p> Brussels launched legal action against the UK last night over Boris Johnson's failure to nominate a British member of the next European Commission.</p><p>It came after the UK's ambassador to Brussels, Sir Tim Barrow, told incoming EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that Mr Johnson would not be appointing one because of the General Election.</p><p>He cited a British convention that 'the UK should not normally make nominations for international appointments' during an election campaign.</p><p>But Brussels hit back, saying Britain was 'in breach of its EU treaty obligations' by not nominating a commissioner because it is still a member state.</p><p>It has given the UK until November 22 to respond.</p><p>Each EU country is supposed to nominate a member to sit on the EU Commission's ruling college.</p><p>Mrs von der Leyen wants the new commission to begin on December 1, two weeks before Britons go to the polls.</p><p>In theory, if the UK continues to refuse to appoint a commissioner, it could be hauled before the European Court of Justice and be fined. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-57873738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH8-RVT1-F021-62RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3308\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

NEW YORK () -- Retail sales are terrible. Buy retailers.Regional Federal Reserve numbers show a slowdown in manufacturing. </p><p>Buy manufacturers.Inflation, a killer of everything financial, has begun to accelerate. Buy the financials.Oil's stalled with too much supply according to OPEC. Buy the oils.Europe's slowing down. Buy the tech stocks, which happen to have more exposure to Europe than just about any other group.China's still braking its economy with threats of raisings rates. Buy the transports, which do huge business with China.How can it be so counterintuitive and crazy? How can we do the opposite of what all the data points say? What the heck is that all about?Okay, I will tell you. There are many, many crosscurrents at work and they are more powerful than individual sectors or stocks. Consider this market like a giant ocean with tides and riptides. When the tide is with you, you look like the greatest swimmer ever -- Mark Spitz or <person><nameText>Michael Phelps. </nameText></person>When the tide goes against you, or if there's a riptide, you are going down, even if you are a Spitz or a Phelps.What makes this moment so hard is that the ocean these swimmers inhabit is not an economic ocean, it is a political ocean where tides are determined by politicians, some of whom are well known and some of whom are unknown.Let's look at the political forces that are dominating trading.First, the retailers. How can they be up, with<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kohl's</emphasis>(KSS:NYSE), (M:NYSE)<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ralph Lauren</emphasis>(RL:Nasdaq) and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VF Corp.</emphasis>(VFC:NYSE) roaring? What's that about? It's because even though many parts of the president's job bill probably will not get passed, he might have enough votes to extend unemployment benefits. Despite tremendously downbeat employment numbers, including today's jobless claims, which were truly terrible, federal unemployment benefits have been a mainstay behind good retail sales numbers. Presidential politics comes to the rescue of the retail sector, so those stocks are going higher.We know that the Federal Reserve data from various regions show that manufacturing is slowing, and that we can't look to that sector for any real strength, even though it was one of the bright spots in the recovery from the Great Recession. But the group has priced in not just a slowdown, but also an actual recession. Many of these stocks are down 15%, 20% and 25%. Even if we don't get a recession, they are too low. In other words, as bad as things may seem, people are expecting worse, and when we don't get it -- like when we heard from<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cummins</emphasis>(CMI:NYSE) earlier in this week that things are still gangbusters -- it's really hard to stay short. How hard? The other day a firm cut numbers for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Caterpillar</emphasis>(CAT:NYSE) and it went higher anyway. That's the tide taking CAT up even as you would expect CAT to go down because the numbers are going lower. How can the financials be going up when we know they are making very little on loans, they are being hamstrung by federal and state lawsuits and their estimates are being sliced, as<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan's</emphasis>(JPM:NYSE) were yesterday? How can we ignore the budding inflation that the Consumer Price Index showed this morning and buy the stocks that almost always get hammered on any inflation scare?Simple. Two words: Tim Geithner.Yesterday, he told me that there will not be a European Lehman Brothers. While these stocks have been punished for their sins, with constant new regulations and prosecutions, the last 20% drop had to do with an expectation that the collapse of European banks will crush our banks. When Geithner took that off the table, whether you believe him or not, you had to figure that the big move down is done for now. So why not cover the shorts? (I don't actually think anyone is starting new positions in these miserable stocks.) Why stay short if the big catalyst, the collapse of some French bank, may not occur?Sure, oil's doing nothing. But what happens if Europe doesn't go off line? What happens if there is no recession? Then it is going to turn out that Brent Crude is not done going up. If that's the case, you can own every oil and every driller, as they were pacing as if Brent was going to drop like West Texas Intermediate. Hmmm, maybe Tim Geithner was right when he told me that the price of oil is more fundamentally driven than I thought.No one denies that Europe's getting weaker, even if systemic risk is off the table, and that means the European portion of tech earnings should get hurt. Every time that has happened, shorts have coined money betting against this group. Why is it different now? It's simple -- tech's seasonality, which tends to go up each year, easily trumps European weakness. Take the SOX. It has had extraordinary outperformance this week, which it tends to do every year as the big tech companies gear up for the holiday season build. You can actually bet that the seasonal tide can take up even the lowliest of techs like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMD</emphasis>(AMD:NYSE) and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Micron</emphasis>(MU:NYSE). You can't bet against it. Mineral and mining without China? That's not been the case for a long time. But understand that the U.S. dollar's losing against the euro, and traders purchase mineral and mining stocks when the dollar's weak. Given that the intervention by Western governments is designed in part to save the euro, this trend can overtake even the Chinese negativity.You see, the politicians who are meddling in every single bit of capitalism are most surely in charge. We are in one of those moments where the politicians are trumpeting agendas that are viewed positively by the stock market. The politicians are the tide, our companies are surfing, and we've caught a wave stronger than just about anyone expected -- but not so strong as to cause a tsunami.Enjoy the ride, but remember: Politicians are fickle and, in this era, they often fail; this run only reflects the success, not the failure, that has accompanied almost every single political initiative since the year began.At the time of publication, Cramer was long CAT and CMI, although positions may change at any time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-11250451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53TB-1C31-JCMB-G069-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><timeReceived>15:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Investors who have major tech stocks in their portfolio should brace for potential volatility this earnings season, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.      \"If you want to own these stocks right now, you've got to be willing to take some pain. You're going to have to watch the rest of the market catch up a bit to them while they decline in value,\" the \"Mad Money\" host predicted. \"But at some point, they'll make a comeback, because these are indeed the best companies on Earth.\"   Cramer's comments come ahead of a jam-packed earnings schedule next week, with tech giants Apple , Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet  all scheduled to report. E-commerce giant Amazon also is set to report.    All of this will take place against the backdrop of  this week's reports from Microsoft and Tesla , which both saw selling pressure after releasing their quarterly numbers, Cramer said. A similar situation ensued for Netflix , he added.    \"All these Big Tech stocks trade together, and when you kick off earnings season with such disappointing action, well, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the group,\" Cramer said.   But Cramer said long-term investors in these stocks should not be too concerned about any potential selling in these stocks. It just might be that they're coming into the quarter \"too hot,\" he said. Plus, he said, the CEOs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook are set to testify before Congress early next week .    Wall Street reacted poorly to Netflix's quarter, primarily as a result of the weak guidance for new subscribers , Cramer said. Some analysts raised concerns about Microsoft's Windows forecast, he said, while other people  broached concerns about Tesla's revenue from the sale of regulatory carbon-emissions credits to other automakers.    No matter the qualms that may have contributed to those two stocks experiencing downside pressure, Cramer said he did not believe they rose to the indication of the companies having a fundamental problem.    \"The stock's just got too hot for the moment. The fundamentals had nothing to do with this sell-off,\" Cramer contended. \"Unfortunately, they also had nothing to do with the last 10 to 15 percentage points of upside, which is why [these] names are so vulnerable.\"     Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet.

That's pretty much the only question worth asking after you put in a bottom, as we did after the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bear Stearns</emphasis> (BSC:NYSE) collapse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody's talking about a new bull market. In fact, Doug Kass <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/10412868/1/kass-wave-goodbye-to-the-rally.html?puc=newshome\">sees an swift end to the rally ahead</url>. But let me give you some thoughts about what has happened in the past few weeks to make it so that you could become more positive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, we went down so much because the systemic risk in the biggest part of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P</emphasis>, the financials, was overwhelming. It is why we \"overcorrected\" because the market feared -- and shorts pressed their bets -- that the following institutions could go under: Bear Stearns, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Washington Mutual</emphasis> (WM:NYSE), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wachovia</emphasis> (WB:NYSE) -- yes, Wachovia, because of the miserable buy of what turned out to be a really reckless lender, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Golden West</emphasis> -- <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lehman Brothers</emphasis> (LEH:NYSE), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Merrill Lynch</emphasis> (MER:NYSE), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup</emphasis> (C:NYSE), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National City</emphasis> (NCC:NYSE), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Capital One</emphasis> (COF:NYSE) and even <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wells Fargo</emphasis> (WFC:NYSE). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fannie</emphasis> (FNM:NYSE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Freddie</emphasis> (FRE:NYSE), too.</p><p>We also felt that the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fed</emphasis> and Treasury would not be engaged, or might not even care.</p><p>Bear changed all of that because the regulation of the banks shifted from the Fed to Treasury, and Bob Steel at the Treasury wasn't going to let the whole shebang go under on his watch, as it very well could have under the Federal Reserve. Steel spoke the language, knew the players. Bernanke knew none of them and was totally reliant on the New York Fed, which had failed repeatedly to create programs that could turn around the situation. The move by Treasury was a total surprise given Hank Paulson's inept handling of the implicit guarantee of agency paper, which of course broke the back of Bear and almost broke the bank of Lehman, as suddenly you needed real collateral for paper that had been considered sacrosanct.</p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"408\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cramer: Why We're Headed for More Gains</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">var config = new Array(); config[\"videoId\"] = 1514326301; config[\"playerTag\"] = \"TSCM Embedded Video Player\"; config[\"autoStart\"] = false; config[\"preloadBackColor\"] = \"#FFFFFF\"; config[\"useOverlayMenu\"] = \"false\"; config[\"width\"] = 265; config[\"height\"] = 255; config[\"playerId\"] = 1243645856; createExperience(config, 8);</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Once you had Bear saved, you knew you had a backstop for all the rest. The fact that we didn't go down, let alone crash, after that Sunday shotgun wedding between Bear and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan</emphasis> (JPM:NYSE) was the bottom, and that's what people are grasping.</p><p>Now we have taken off the table the collapse of Lehman with the bond issue, although the bears don't want to believe that; Wachovia and Washington Mutual with cash infusions (soon National City, too); Citigroupwith a breakup (we all see that happening) and better-than-expected revenues; and Wells because it is an obvious choice for Treasury's next anointed acquirer. Merrill Lynch doesn't need capital, there was only so much damage that could be done by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Franklin</emphasis>. Meanwhile, the leveraged loan market is being freed up, allowing banks to raise more capital even if they take realized losses. In previous tough times, many of these last deals would have already blown up. The worst, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Freescale</emphasis>, is still alive and kicking (even though maybe it shouldn't be).</p><p>Other outfits, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CIT</emphasis> (CIT:NYSE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">E*Trade</emphasis> (ETFC:Nasdaq), proved more resilient. Capital One may still be considered a good short, but the defaults aren't that high, especially for credit cards, and the bears can do their best to raid it with lies but they can't do much to destroy it. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank of America</emphasis> (BAC:NYSE)? It got pantsed when it paid too much for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Countrywide</emphasis> (CFC:NYSE), which probably would have been a casualty otherwise, but it will muddle through and at one point will be a buy. And it was obviously an awful quarter. But they ain't going out of business -- it's just a bad place right now, nothing more.</p><p>Retail's terrible, but if the worst that happens is a failure of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Linens 'n Things</emphasis>, which was ridiculously levered, and a couple of bank lines pull from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Talbots</emphasis> (TLB:NYSE), who cares? We haven't had retail bankruptcies galore, and that's surprising too, given that we used to have them even when the economies were good. Restaurants stink, but they hang in. Again, even in good times we have lost restaurants; if the worst is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruby Tuesday's</emphasis> (RT:NYSE), who the heck cares? It was never that hot a place to eat anyway.</p><p>Homebuilders? Sorry -- no bankruptcies there, either. That's a preposterous thing, given what has happened, but it is a reality. The banks didn't close them down. They could have; they didn't. They are all going to make it, and some will prosper beyond what we think possible because all of the mom and pops are out of business; that's how bad this moment is. It's a good group, we all know it. We are worried about silly things like HGX resistance. Give me a break.</p><p>Those are the only segments of the S&amp;P that are bad, and because of endless shrinkage of their capitalization, they are turning out to be less important to the overall direction of the market than ever before. More important? Industrials, oils and gases -- by leaps and bounds -- ag, foods and drugs (weak dollar and I expect large gains in drugs post-election). The utilities and transports are big. The latter is in the midst, ex-airlines, of a simply miraculous run and it isn't ending, I think it will broaden to shipping now that the world is not going into a recession and those stocks reflected it. I like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frontline</emphasis> (FRO:NYSE). Others, more-risky dry shipping players, now seem like good bet, too.</p><p>Tech proved more resilient and has already had the stuffing kicked out of it. (Most of the big tech stocks have been at the same prices for years, so big deal.) <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel</emphasis> (INTC:Nasdaq), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco</emphasis> (CSCO:Nasdaq), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> (MSFT:Nasdaq), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis> (ORCL:Nasdaq): They've done nothing for years. They could do nothing and it won't matter much; or they could drift higher and their multiples will still be cheap. More an opportunity than a challenge.</p><p>We have some phone companies that yield too much to be worried about. Defense keeps growing as a percentage of the S&amp;P. Basically, there is too much good, and not that much expensive.</p><p>So, the logical issue is where do we go from here? I say we go up. Not in a straight line, because we had things like expiration last week that ramped up things unnaturally, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Schlumberger</emphasis> (SLB:NYSE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> (GOOG:Nasdaq), and then all that were associated with it.</p><p>But the bottom line is that things are simply better in the market, not the economy.</p><p>That's good; they lead. Economy follows. Every time, including this time.</p><p>At the time of publication, Cramer had no positions in the stocks mentioned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-10412842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SBG-7FD0-TXDP-S1C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1103\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 TheStreet.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ: AAPL[1]) will be broken up.Cramer: 'I Get Where The Regulators Are Coming From'CNBC's Jim Cramer recalled during his daily \"Mad Money\" show[2] a story from20 years ago, when he was running his financial website TheStreet.com. Cramer held a meeting with then-internet giant America Online, which he saidoffered Cramer a $2-million deal in exchange for content to be posted on its internet portal. </p><p>AOL's power over the internet at that time was \"ludicrous,\" and it was nearly impossible for anyone to make it big on the internet without the backing of AOL, he said. Legendary media pioneer and AOL Networks CEO Bob Pittman presented apartnership under which his financial website couldthrive under AOL, Cramer said. The only catch: instead of AOL paying Cramer's company $2 million, Pittman wanted Cramerto pay AOL $2 million. If Cramer didn't agree to the new terms, he was obviously free to take his business elsewhere, Cramer said \u2014 but there wasn't anywhere else to go. That firsthand experience is relevant to big tech companies today, Cramer said. For example, a company isn't forced to advertise its products on Google's search engine \u2014 which Cramer saidis known to tilt search results to favor its own businesses. \"You don't have to advertise on Google,\" the CNBC host said. \"You are free to find another gigantic search engine. Just don't hold your breath.\" As an investor who wants to see stock prices move higher, it is difficult to be \"thrilled\" with recent rhetoric from lawmakers, he said. But as someone who was \"on the other end of this dynamic\" when AOL was dominating the internet, Cramer saidhe gets \"where the regulators are coming from.\"Are Amazon, Google, Apple Monopolies?Apple CEO Tim Cook could make the case that his company's iPhone faces competition from rival smartphone makers, and the App Store faces direct competition from the likes of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG[3]) (NASDAQ: GOOGL[4]), the American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukistold CNBC[5]Wednesday. While it is \"OK to be big and dominant\" under existing antitrust law, what is not acceptable is to hurt consumers through \"bad practices,\" he said. It will be very difficult to make the case that Apple is engaged in activities that hurt consumers, since it offers free services that consumers \"greatly value,\" the AEI policy analyst said. The odds of breaking up some of the world's largest companies are \"unlikely,\" although new laws related to security or privacy could be written, he said.Could A Breakup Benefit Stocks?Assuming Apple is guilty of operating as a monopoly, a potential remedy would be splitting the Services business from the legacy hardware business, Larry Haverty of LJH Investment Advisors told CNBC. The end result would be a new company that would trade at a much higher valuation given its superior growth profiles and margins prospects, he said. \"The parts are worth more than the whole.\" Related Link:  Antitrust Investigation Of Big Tech Ordered By Trump Would 'Act As A Cover' For Election Loss, Says Height Capital Markets[6] Trump: US Committed To 'Phenomenal Trade Deal' With Britain[7]  2019 Benzinga.com.

Today's tech leaders like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are \"some of the most profitable companies in history,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.  But Cramer said government regulation, geopolitical tensions and controlling the coronavirus do present risks to tech's role in powering stocks higher.   CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday that the stock market's rally from coronavirus crisis lows shouldn't be compared with the speculation in tech stocks that preceded the bursting of the dot-com bubble.    Unlike the 1990s speculation in unproven internet firms, tech companies with demonstrated track records of success \u2014 like Apple , Amazon , Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet \u2014 are helping power today's market higher,  the \"Mad Money\" host said.    \"If you look at the top 20 companies in the Nasdaq  in 1999, not one of them looked like today's winners,\" Cramer said, calling them \"some of the most profitable companies in history.\"    However, Cramer stressed that there are potential developments that could stand in the way and prevent many of these large-cap tech stocks, which also includes the likes of Netflix and Facebook , from continuing to dominate the market.     The first of those risks focuses on the U.S. attempts to combat its Covid-19 outbreak, Cramer said. If the country is able to improve its response through more testing, face mask wearing and government stimulus until there's a vaccine for the novel virus, Cramer said he sees investors starting to embrace economically sensitive sectors in the S&amp;P 500 that have lagged in 2020.    \"We'll be going out, traveling, and that means the money from the Cramer Covid-19 winners will rotate into the Covid losers. It's just what happens,\" Cramer said. \"I see this as inevitable because sooner or later we'll get a vaccine, but inevitable doesn't necessarily mean now or even in the next three months or even in the next six months.\"   Cramer said government regulation is another threat to the leadership from some of these tech names. He noted the upcoming congressional testimony from the CEOs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.    \"If there's an antitrust crackdown on Big Tech, you'll see some real declines here because then we'll have a lot less visibility into their future earnings streams,\" he said.    The continued escalation of tensions between the Trump administration and China presents an additional layer of risk, Cramer said. The U.S. has in recent days claimed Chinese hackers were targeting coronavirus vaccine research  and then ordered the country to shut down its consulate in Houston . Beijing has threatened retaliation.    \"If the White House goes into a full bore cold war with China, and it does look like we might, many of these companies will lose a major chunk of their sales, especially Apple,\" Cramer said.    Even though some tech firms lack much exposure to the Chinese market, the nature of exchange-traded funds means \"they all are joined,\"  he said.    Investors also need to be mindful of inflation after trillions of dollars of stimulus was injected into the economy in response to the coronavirus, Cramer said.    \"Nobody wants to pay up for growth stocks when inflation is raging. The nonindex owners will dump them because inflation destroys the value of those big earnings in the outyears,\" he said.    Cramer said the final risk to the current tech rally comes down to the upcoming presidential election. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is proposing to tax capital gains like ordinary income, Cramer said, which he said has a real possibility of being enacted if the Republicans lose control of the Senate.    \"Whether or not you think this is good policy, it would be extremely bad for stock prices and I'd expect a lot of people want to sell now to get out ahead of it,\" he said.    All of these potential challenges for tech companies are dramatically different than what caused the dot-com bubble to burst in early 2000, Cramer said.    \"I don't see this market collapsing on valuation or fraud or insider selling or inflation, which is currently nonexistent,\" Cramer said, but risks presented by government regulation and geopolitical tensions are real.    \"And, most importantly, if we get the pandemic under control and the economy comes roaring back \u2026 Big Tech will go out of style as people rush for the recovery stocks,\" he said.

(NASDAQ: AAPL[1]) introduced a new lineup of iPhones[2]Tuesday, and social media company Facebook, Inc.</p><p>(NASDAQ: FB[3]) could emerge as a winner, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer.Best Pictures For InstagramFacebook continues to find itself in the crosshairsof regulators and advocacy groups warning that are focused on privacy issues. Throughout the whole saga, Facebook \u2014 and its lineup of messaging and social media apps \u2014 hasn't suffered in terms of users on its platform, Cramer said during his daily \"Mad Money\" show. Many users who quit the platform out of protest have likely since returned, he said. How does this relate to Apple's product launch? Simple, Cramer said. Apple's new lineup of iPhones with upgraded cameras allows for better wide-angle photos and may have been made specifically for \"getting the best possible photos for Instagram,\" he said.The Selfie GenerationCramer said theviews he expressedWednesday are consistent with what he has been saying for years in that the \"selfie generation\" is too big to ignore. \"I'm not really qualified to judge the quality of the triple camera in the new phone, but it looks incredible,\" Cramer said. Bottom line: Facebook has not only \"survived\" regulatory and legal battles, but it is \"thriving,\" he said. The stock was down 0.31% at $187.90 at the time of publication Thursday.

In doing so, the president also sought to rally his widely followed online allies, whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" that together can reach roughly half a billion people, entering the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his winding diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter - charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied - at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social-media meme makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president actually aimed to use the policy summit as a re-election push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed their controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, meanwhile, charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter each declined comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump himself calling him \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they're biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking a series of hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he's cited to illustrate the industry's bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.</p><p>\"A lot of bad things are happening,\" he said.</p><p>Trump's attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some of social media's content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.</p><p>\"This is largely, I think, a political event,\" said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other tech giants. He stressed there is \"no conservative bias on our platforms.\"</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media - and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise on Thursday.</p><p>\"Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,\" O'Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black,\" and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.</p><p>\"After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,\" according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. \"The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.\"</p><p>Initially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a \"media distraction from the president's message.\"</p><p>Trump also invited lawmakers including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who have accused Twitter in the past of limiting the reach of their tweets. They were joined by organizations such as the Media Research Center, a conservative group that has called for the breakup of big tech companies, and PragerU, which produces right-leaning videos that it believes Google has censored - a matter the two sides are battling in court.</p><p>In an early morning series of tweets, Trump said that the focus of the conversation would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" though he didn't mention any by name. \"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he added.</p><p>Trump also appeared to suggest social-media sites \"would be driven out of business\" once he leaves office in six years or more, acknowledging he had made a joke about exceeding presidential term limits.</p><p>Lawmakers bristled at the summit: Many said that the Trump administration had missed an opportunity to explore real challenges facing social media ahead of the 2020 election, amid heightened fears about the spread of hate speech and even harder-to-detect viral falsehoods.</p><p>\"It's not surprising that one of the loudest disseminators of misinformation is inviting known extremists and conspiracy theory peddlers to the White House social media summit,\" said Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, who leads the House's top tech committee. \"It's a shame President Trump would prefer to fan the same fires of online social discord that Russia sparked in the 2016 election rather than bring real experts together to address the issue of content moderation in a thoughtful and rational manner.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-149010271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-JY41-F11P-X1FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

An thank you  for joining us.  We're going to say good morning to --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SIMONETTI:  -- Cavuto.  Whoa.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It is very early.  It's very,  very early.  But I admire how you guys do that.  All right.  Thank you very  much guys.  We are following on a couple of developments here.  I'm very  happy to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Neil Cavuto in for my colleague and friend Maria Bartiromo.  We're  going to be getting a very big news coming on the retail sector.  Home  Depot kicking things off, we'll get to that in a second. I should also tell  you that things have stabilized when it comes to Turkey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, that's sort of a perspective on just the freefall had stopped.  That  doesn't take away the fact that the currency has been cut in half if you  think about it in a little more than a couple of weeks.  So we'll be on top  of that and the fallout. </p><p>But for the Futures, for the European markets, with the Asian markets  they've welcomed these developments because the beating has for the moment  stopped.  That doesn't mean that the beating will not resume down the road.   For now, the markets are seizing on this as a promising development.  </p><p>We should also say that these contagion fears are still real no matter what  is happening.  We're following on that, the effects it could have on  markets that sparked on in South Africa, in Argentina, Brazil, you name it,  they're all caught in the mix,.</p><p>Here with me today, Fox Contributor Kat Timpf.  We've got the Wall Street  Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.  And CFRA Investment  Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey, and with you -- begin with you first on  your concerns about what's been happening with Turkey.  A little bit of  stability today, maybe Home Depot safe today in just a second, but what do  you make of it?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  The stability today is an  encouraging development for sure.  But like you said, the lira is down  almost 50 percent year-to-date, that's a little bit shocking especially for  this type of country.</p><p>But the issue here is that their country, they don't have government debt,  they have debt that is coming from other countries and then is valued in  the dollar.  I mean, as the dollar rises, this is a problem.  At CFRA we  have -- we reduce our exposure to merging markets earlier this year because  interest rates rising, the dollar is expected to rise.  So that was an area  we wanted to move away from.</p><p>But, you know, if you look at the overall -- the Wall Street Journal, Jon  I'd love to hear your thoughts too, has a great article in there this  morning too about how even though the fall that we've seen so far, the  valuations of the -- of the debt and the equity markets are not at these  very deep discounted levels.</p><p>So theoretically the story of the emerging markets may not entirely be  over, although it has come down.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, maybe just looking for that pause, right?  At least  something.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well you tend -- when you get these  emerging market crisis, you tend to -- they tend to come in pulses and then  you can have things stabilize for a few days but it doesn't mean by any  stretch that Turkish problems are finished.</p><p>You know, as you said they have all this U.S. dollar debt, they have all  the earmarks of an emerging market crisis.  A lot of U.S. dollar debt, a  falling currency, large current account debt --</p><p>CAVUTO:  And by the way, we're stating the obvious here about the more  currency tumbles against the dollar.  In this case, the more it's going to  take to, you know, get out of that hole.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And we will -- we will talk about this --</p><p>CAVUTO:  -- that stronger dollar just makes it more of a hole. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We were talking about this yesterday, the next sure to drop is  the banks because the banks are exposed.  You know, when interest rates  rise we're seeing interest rates rise.  A lot in Turkey when their currency  falls loans go bad and you start to see banks destabilized.  So that's  where I'm looking next and --</p><p>CAVUTO:  And this is 180 from what it was, right?  I mean, when times are  good the banks were loaning to anyone in -- you know --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And that's where it's getting all the trouble.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And that's what complicated things, right?  Yes. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And then -- so then the other thing to look at is, do  this go over into any other markets?  You mention in the opening, South  Africa, you have to be a little worried about.  Argentina just got a big  IMF loan to stabilize its economy and its financial markets, maybe Brazil,  Russia.</p><p>But, you know, when you look at a lot of Turkish problems are unique to  Turkey especially this fight that they've got going on right now with the  United States over this American pastor.  So it's possible that this is  just a Turkish problem.</p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, if they released Pastor Andrew Brunson problems go  away or no?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, they have fundamental economic problems.  They have -- as  I -- yes, as I said they've got destabilized banking system --</p><p>CAVUTO:  But our tariffs going to stop, right?  Our tariffs would  presumably stop.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well -- so it could help and stabilize things a little bit  because, you know, who knows maybe the president would reverse it, he just  doubled the tariffs.  Maybe he'd go back to where they were a few weeks  ago.</p><p>They certainly would stop putting tightening the screws on the country, so  that would give Erdogan a little bit more breathing room.  But it doesn't  sound like he's going to respond --</p><p>BELL:  Which is going to hurt Turkey even more and that would be a major  problem.  But --</p><p>CAVUTO:  But what if he was released today?</p><p>BELL:  If you were to --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Released today, the pastor were released today and that was the  reason why the president double those tariffs on, you know, aluminum and  metal related products.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think that would be a positive sign for the country but I  think that the issues have been building the concerns here --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes. </p><p>BELL:  -- for quite some time now.  So I don't think that the story is  over.  It will -- it will be a little bit of a relief rally perhaps in the  lira.  But I think that they have bigger problems to deal with.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know Neil, whenever we've written over the past few years  about spasms in emerging markets whether it be Argentina or some other  country and we start looking at what countries could be next, Turkey was  always at the top of the list.</p><p>We were always talking about the economic fundamentals just weren't in good  shape there.  One of the problems there is the way they deal -- the way  they manage the central bank, there's no central bank independence, a lot  of concerns.  Inflation is exceptionally high in Turkey, a lot of concerns  there.  The central bank let the currency go.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So I'm curious, like what potentially saves the day?  Home Depot  is out with numbers that beat estimates right now.  So that could -- that  could be a catalyst or a good development, right?</p><p>I mean, we've been looking at retail as the sign of what the individual  consumer is doing, I don't know whether Home Depot shoppers and now it's to  Nordstrom shopper and a Macy shopper and a Walmart shopper.  But that's  been the backdrop for the president, right?  That's been his position of  strength.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  And you know what, last year at this time we were -- the  whole market really assumed the retail was just a debt, this story was  completely over and it's been revitalized.  It's starting in the fourth  quarter of last year.</p><p>Home Depot this morning be on top and bottom line, it's very impressive.   They had a weaker first quarter report and that was because of whether, you  know, you hate to blame the weather but the gardening business is really  slow.  So I suspect, I haven't seen all the details here but I'm guessing  the gardening business was able to pick up with better weather.</p><p>And we're really expecting the retailers to do well this quarter because  spending has rebound significantly in the second quarter.  After taking a  little bit of a break in the first quarter, you've got GDP 4.1 percent in  the second quarter.  Unemployment is at such low levels, confidence is  high.</p><p>It's really just the perfect storm for retail right now even though these  stocks, if you look at the S&amp;P500 retail index, it's up over 30 percent  year-to-date, much better --</p><p>CAVUTO:  As earnings in the aggregate I mean they're --</p><p>BELL:  Right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  -- (INAUDIBLE) I think they're running at a -- close to 25 percent  flip over last year, that's a lot stronger than people thought it would be.</p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  And, you know, it's going to continue through the second  half of the year.  Numbers have actually remained stable and that was  something that was a concern.  Tariffs and different things do political  concerns on the forefront, but the numbers have been steady and going up  actually.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, one of the big themes the last few years has been  the death of retail because of Amazon and online shopping.  And one of the  surprises this year is that retail is hanging in there, you mentioned all  these earnings numbers.</p><p>But when you look at the employment numbers, one of the fastest growing  sectors for hiring right now is retail.  It's really surprising retail and  manufacturing are the two biggest employers for hiring.  And, you know, the  other thing I'd say is we have retail sales data coming out.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's true.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  (INAUDIBLE) these earnings numbers tomorrow retail sales data  coming out, so we'll see.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't think there's a better barometer on the mood of the  consumer than whether he or she is shopping, right?  And then I'm wondering  when you talk to your friends, you know, you're very cheap I know that --</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  -- when you go out Kat.  But the people are more predisposed to  buy than they've been in many year and I'm wondering what you make of that.</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that there is very high consumer confidence.  But I am  surprised about the brick and mortar stores actually doing decently well  because I haven't gone to a store to buy a thing in probably years.</p><p>Even like toilet paper, paper towel, I get that all delivered via Amazon  Prime.  I don't like to leave my apartment probably more than the average  bear.  So I'm -- I guess some people might go to the store occasionally but  --</p><p>CAVUTO:  To physically go to any store.</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't.  I get --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Really?</p><p>TIMPF:  -- absolutely everything delivered to my apartment.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Interesting.</p><p>TIMPF:  Unless I'll have to try on shoes.  I'll try on shoes and then I'll  leave the store and buy them online for cheaper.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, you know, the people are -- I'm not saying they're shopping  was abandoned but there -- you know, through all the vagaries and the  crises and, you know, the Turkish disruptions and then the trade tariff  disruption, one constant has been the consumer.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  No.  Absolutely has been true.  And I think part of the thing  too and I think part of the thing too is with the brick and mortar stores  that they've been building out their direct consumer, their online  businesses and you'll see -- we'll probably hear that through some of the  second quarter earnings that they're still investing in and that there's  worry that that might impact margins a little bit.</p><p>But the consumer is feeling good and they are shopping and that is  definitely that big in the economy.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And they also have money in their pockets because they're  withholding -- the government is withholding less from their paychecks for  taxes because of the tax cuts last year.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, this is the position the president has bragged about has  been the win that is back and then that if you're going to go into a trade  war, he doesn't call it a trade war, but if you're going to go into a  fight, this is -- this is a position you want to be in.  Do you guys buy  that?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the economy is strong right now so he is  negotiating from a position of strength.  The only thing -- you know, sorry  to be a nervous Nellie but --</p><p>CAVUTO:  You do have that reputation.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But we're building a very large budget deficits.  We're  talking about $1 trillion budget deficits and things feel good right now,  let's talk again in --</p><p>CAVUTO:  We've been building those up for quite a few years.</p><p>BELL:  Nobody said they were going to coming -- they were coming down  actually.  You know, when republicans were in-charge of Congress they push  the Obama Administration to squeeze spending.  </p><p>So as a percent of GDP, the deficits were coming down but they're going  back up.  It's unprecedented how far -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Would you blame that one -- some blame it on the tax cuts, others  ignore the spending component of that.  I mean --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  This Congress and this White House just increased --  you know, just get a big increase in government spending.  And so -- and  some of this stuff wanes in 2020, 2021.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  This is your paper if memory serves me right that pointed out that  revenues from those tax cuts have been actually a pleasant surprise.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well they were in June but -- they were in May I think but in  June and July they soften a little bit.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So you're not a believer yet?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're challenging your own newspaper.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We reported what was the case in May but it was just one  month.  The last couple of months have been softer on the revenue side.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think those tax cuts are something that is explaining  what's going on at Home Depot, explaining what could be going on at Walmart  and Macy's and Dillard's and Nordstrom and all these other numbers that are  due out in the next few days that that has really fueled all of this?</p><p>TIMPF:  I think it depends on the person.  I think that for some people  that was a lot more money than it was for other people.  I think for a lot  of people that, you know, it does make a difference.</p><p>It was a huge chunk of change compared to what they're used to having but  at the same time it does bother me that we did tax cuts without spending  cuts because I remember when republicans were supposed to be the fiscally  conservative party and always talking about the debt and the deficit and  now it just turns out that they're adding to the deficit in different ways.</p><p>Which I certainly rather have a tax cut than more entitlement programs and  everyone keep more of their own money than it is something that we need to  be concerned about at some point.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We did tax cuts with spending increases.</p><p>TIMPF:  Right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  We did the worst.  Yes.  I do find it odd though when we  focus on the battle over taxes and spending and all that.  You know, I  think this budget has, what, almost $12 trillion in extra spending added to  the debt in the next 10 years and yet everyone makes a big deal over one  and a half to one to one and three quarter trillion in tax cuts and the  revenue there and not something that's 10 times larger on spending.</p><p>BELL:  I agree with you.  I think you make a very good point and should  continue to make that point on air.  But it's -- it is in -- it is a  concern because as the Fed is going to raise interest rates it's going to  become a major problem.</p><p>But right now you're seeing the tenure thing below three percent which is  being kind of crazy.  And so the market doesn't really want have -- or  individuals don't really have any reason to get too concerned yet and  that's why I think people really just avoiding the topic.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So Lindsey, you mentioned the Fed -- the other thing that we  have to look out for is relations between the White House and the Fed over  the next couple of years.  You know, not only -- and the Trump is -- the  president has tweeted about this, about his discomfort --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- with the Fed raising interest rates.  But not only does it  --</p><p>CAVUTO:  He's not the first president frustration.  He's just publicly  stated it, right?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And, you know, Lyndon Johnson famously --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- you know, poked his finger as Fed chairman and said you  can't -- you know, you're hurting my war effort.  So -- but the worry here  I think for the president is not only could it slow the economy, it makes  it even more expensive to finance all this debt that we're building.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That reminds me guys and I know we have to cut for break here  pretty soon, but when you look at the -- let's say Home Depot is not a  trend for the entire retail industry, I hasten to add that.</p><p>But if you're sitting at the Federal Reserve, you're looking at yet another  piece of evidence that shows the economy picking up the same people  (INAUDIBLE)/ going out and buying things, you know, willy-nilly.  Does that  get -- confirm your view that you have to keep raising rates?</p><p>BELL:  I think it's more, you know, they're going to look to inflation  which we saw has been ticking up.  And they do believe that there will be  some one off period or months that you'll see inflation above their two  percent target, the core inflation number which we saw in the most recent  reading.</p><p>But I think based on that they're going to act accordingly.  The market  right now is expecting two rate hikes at the end of this year.  And I think  that will --</p><p>CAVUTO:  So two more this year.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  And that still baked into the cake, do you agree with that Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  Yes.  I think they go to two and a half or three  percent and then they see how inflation is developing and if, you know --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Two and a half or three percent in an overnight bank lending rate,  right?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And then they see how inflation is developing and, you know,  if it's continuing to rise they -- maybe they keep going.  I think the plan  right now is to keep going into next year to two and a half and three  percent.</p><p>And it's going to be really interesting to see to watch the president's  Twitter account to see how frustrated he's getting with those rate  increases.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Because it starts to wonder why you're -- is strong a good  thing.  You know Kat, we talk about sentiment and people's moods improving,  when you talk to people, you do sneak out of your apartment.  Are you  getting any vibes from your friends, colleagues that, you know, something  good could be going here.</p><p>I think I'm going to buy more and then I'm going to do more, you know, the  kind of stuff that we -- we've had false starts prior but this seems to be  a consistent pattern.</p><p>TIMPF:  Absolutely.  A lot more shopping, a lot more vacations.  It seems  actually looking on Instagram every now and then, I'm certain of my friends  are literally always on vacation.  Do you have any people like that that  you know off that are just always posting from Bora Bora?</p><p>BELL:  I do.</p><p>TIMPF:  It's like, \"OK, don't you have a job?\"  But, yes, I absolutely do  think that there's higher confidence right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  We're going to take a quick break here.  We're going to get  sort of the latest on what's happening right now in Turkey where at least  for the time being calmer, cooler heads are prevailing.</p><p>Meantime, we'll give you the latest on this apparent car crash outside  parliament in London.  No one is calling this a terrorist incident, in  fact, a few are characterizing it any -- which way.  But it has happened  again, raise concerns again and a lot of people getting nervous again.   It's not being reflected in the market certainly but we're on top of it.   More for this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  We're still trying to find out more about this car  that rammed a (INAUDIBLE) British Parliament.  Cheryl Casone has much more  on this.  Cheryl, what happened?</p><p>CASONE:  Well it's very interesting Neil.  This all happened overnight out  in London.  At this stage Scotland Yard not calling it a terror attack but  they're treating the incident as terrorism.  They arrested the driver of  the vehicle, they say he drove through crown of pedestrians and then  crashed into a gate just outside of parliament as you mentioned.</p><p>Several were injured, streets in the surrounding area corned off in the  nearby Westminster underground tube station has been closed.  The area the  site of a terror attack back in March of 2017 where Khalid Masood plowed a  car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, you may remember that.  </p><p>Four people died in that incident.  We're, of course, going to provide more  information as we get it out of our Fox London Bureau this morning.</p><p>Well here at home, motorists in four states are heading to the pole today,  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont, and Connecticut were holding primaries.  In  Wisconsin President Trump call for a boycott of Harley-Davidson that forced  Governor Scott Walker and the republicans to either criticize the president  or stick with the Milwaukee-based company.  Eight democrats are buying to  challenge walker.</p><p>And in Minnesota, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison has been accused of  emotionally and physically abusing his ex-girlfriend.  He is running for  the State Attorney General spot.  He has several opponents in that race.</p><p>Now, one of the four Vermont Democrat seeking the party nomination for  governor isn't even old enough to vote.  Meet 14-year-old Ethan Sonnerborn.   He -- now he does not meet the requirements to be in the -- actually he  does meet the requirements in the ballot because his parents allowed him to  do so.</p><p>He's taking his place with the state's more age-appropriate candidate.  The  state constitution doesn't have an age requirement for people seeking the  state's highest office.  He's taking full advantage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ETHAN SONNERBORN (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, VERMONT:  I think my  campaign transcend age.  Only they'll think of me as pragmatic progressive  who happen to be 14.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  He's 14.  Ethan has raised just over $1,700.  Unfortunately not  enough to make him competitive and, yes, his parents had to allow him to  get on the ballot.</p><p>OK.  And then finally we're going to end with this Neil, check out the  price of Bitcoin, the digital currency falling below $6,000 for the first  time since June.  At one point trading just above 5,800 bucks.  Nearly  every other cryptocurrency under pressure this morning.  </p><p>Digital currency has, of course, rallied last month on hopes that new  investors would be attracted to Bitcoin back ETF but the SEC has postponed  a decision Neil on the phone.  Remember when Bitcoin was $20,000?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  You can imagine that we question that at the time.  Hmm.</p><p>CAVUTO:  you know, I'm curious about this kid in Vermont.  Not only because  he looks like I did I would say but (INAUDIBLE).  If he gets elected, he  can be governor?</p><p>CASONE:  Legally on the ballot.  Yes.  His parents had to sign off but he  is legally on the ballot.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Some with the legal community in the state have something to say  about it possibly.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  All right.  Well, it's Vermont.  All right.  Thank you very,  very much.  I always learned something Cheryl from your updates.  We're on  top of that.  </p><p>We're also on top of another company on the verge at hitting $1 trillion  market gap.  In fact, they're lining up like claims at LaGuardia right now.   Amazon could be the next; we're on it after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  After Apple, Amazon?  It could happen.  $1 trillion in  market value maybe sooner than you think.  Lauren Simonetti is here.   Lauren, good to see you back.  Well they have another pleasure.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good to see you.  Welcome back to you as well Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Amazon will be a $1 trillion because the share price only has  to go up seven percent and they do join Apple in the, $1 trillion club.  </p><p>Forester Research out with a note and they say, \"Look, Amazon's actually  better than Apple because consumers like Amazon more.  You know, it's --  you have your iPhone, you have your Apple T.V. </p><p>TIMPF:  Amazon is the only reason I'm still alive, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well you're good with that.  But with Amazon they just keep  selling to you whether it's Alexa or a hardware or your -- you know, what - - your diapers, whatever you buy in Amazon.  They are in so many different  branches.  </p><p>So Amazon should be next if you look at the latest numbers at the market  capitalizations of the big tech stocks.  So Apple had a million, trillion  right now $940 billion.  Google, Alphabet 875 billion.  Look at Microsoft,  $840 billion.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's been sneaking up there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It has been sneaking up.  Where's Facebook in all of this?   Well, $524 billion is the market capitalization.  So we are seeing in some  senses a differentiation between the tech companies.</p><p>Not so popular among investors right now where the tech companies that are  very reliant on advertising dollars.  Hence Facebook not as popular as some  of the others at this point in the game.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what's interesting about it too, there used to be a time,  right in a phonetic go-go late 90s internet (INAUDIBLE) that you invested  on promise, not profit because they didn't have to make money.  All of  those names make money and a lot.  ELMORE:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So was it different now?</p><p>BELL:  I think so.  I mean, Amazon they've really -- they're using WF cloud  business to fund the retail and other business and the other branches,  they're getting their hand in -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Healthcare </p><p>BELL:  -- in everything.  Yes.  Healthcare.  So - mean, I think Amazon  they're growth opportunity, they're probably much more significant than  Apple.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And they're taking all over the world.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it's totally different in the '90s. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, in the '90s almost anyone could IPO.  All you needed  was an idea and a few connections on Wall Street and you are (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Now market has really dominated by just a few big companies.   You know, Amazon, Apple.  It's really interesting to see Microsoft on there  though.  Microsoft has really reinvented itself, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Completely.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  We don't depend on Microsoft Office the way we used to  but they manage to keep themselves relevant in a very fast changing  environment.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I was noticing they all have a great reliance and very viable  business on the cloud, you know, up there.</p><p>TIMPF:  That's where it is.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And I was wondering, where is all this stuff?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's in the cloud.</p><p>TIMPF:  In the cloud.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's in the cloud.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a very good name for it. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I spent $2.99 a month for my cloud of pictures.  </p><p>TIMPF:  But do you know how to actually access it?  Do you know how to  actually access it?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No.  But my husband does, so we're good.</p><p>TIMPF:  OK.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Sure your kids would love one, yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this data farms in like Utah and stuff.  That's where --  it's actually on the ground.  But --</p><p>CAVUTO:  But that was the reason for Microsoft's turnaround, right?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't know with that.  I'm still trying to figure out --</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't know -- I know I have stuff in there but how do I ever see  it?  I'm spending the $2.99 too, I don't know why.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well maybe you just got to get out of your apartment and  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what's weird about though -- and Jon when you were  mentioning this, this idea that it's different from the late 1990s and  that, you know these are money making ventures and have a clear business  model.  But are they rich to you?  Even allowing for the --</p><p>BELL:  Well, some of them do have high multiples, Amazon being one that  (INAUDIBLE) other.  But if you look at technology overall, the multiples  about 19 times.  By historical sandals it's not too bad.  They average for  the tech space in the 90s when things were getting a little out of control  about 60 times, so we're pretty far from that from most of the sector.</p><p>And you're actually seeing breath across the tech sector.  So everyone  sites these large mega cap company, he's on that -- they've done  significantly well.  But you're also starting to see some of these smaller,  lesser known companies that don't the headlines and the media tension do  well.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But Lindsey, a lot of these multiples have come down in the  last several quarter in particular because we've had such good earnings.</p><p>BELL:  That's a pullback.  Same thing happened earlier this year, you had  the pullback in the tech sector is a great -- turn out to be a great time  to get in.  And I think that's what happened after, you know, big Facebook  user debacle and some of Netflix.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think the market has another big run after the  midterms?  You know, had a big run after the presidential election?  Is it  gearing up for another big run after these midterms are out of the way?</p><p>BELL:  Well historically that has been the case.  The 12 months after the  midterm election you see the market go about 16 percent on average in the  next 12 months which is -- it goes back to the question we all the market  can't handle on certainties.  </p><p>So when you have certainty re-enter the market we know who's going to be  in-charge of Congress for the -- for the next couple of years.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But does that apply even when the market, like the case of S&amp;P is  at a six or seven percent run up ahead of that?</p><p>BELL:  Yes, I do. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Really?  OK.  That's fine.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  But you never have certainty with Donald Trump at office.  So - -</p><p>BELL:  Right.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Like that will -- that would point out (INAUDIBLE) this year.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't think he ever have certainty.  You know, certainty  just changes from one thing to another.</p><p>BELL:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  You are so going to get a nasty tweet from the president  now.  All right.  We have a lot more coming out here.  Lauren, I want to  thank you very, very much for that.</p><p>You know, just when it looks like Turkey situations can't get worst, along  comes an idea to kick it out of NATO because of how it's happening.  That  should help after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Good morning, everybody, happy to have you, I'm Neil Cavuto, in  for my colleague and friend, Maria Bartiromo.  We are trying to keep you  abreast of what seemed to be calming markets worldwide because Turkey isn't  free-falling anymore.</p><p>Not that it's soaring, it's just stopped falling.  But doesn't mean that  again, pull again, but the Futures seem to like it.  In the foreign  markets, Europe, and in Asia, all seemed to like it.  The question is how  long it will last.  </p><p>We should add here very, very quickly that Turkish central bank has by the  number of measures here, meant to stabilize things and limiting how much  currency you could take out of the country, how much you could exchange for  dollars, et cetera.  </p><p>The idea to put some, sort of, a mandate on all of these and that's all it  might be, but we are -- have seen the markets respond favorably  developments and rumors, and I should stress rumors in the Financial Times  and elsewhere, that the pastor at the center of this fight with the United  States, Andrew (INAUDIBLE) in fact, could be released.  </p><p>No one is saying one way or the other (INAUDIBLE) likely, just that it is  been held out there, that President Erdogan might do that just to get the  pressure of those tariffs, doubling (INAUDIBLE) tariffs off his back from  President Donald Trump, we shall see.</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking of President Trump, he signed the Defense Authorization  Act as expected yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The National Defense  Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our military and  our war fighters in modern history.  And I am very proud to be a big, big  part of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And it is a big, big number, about $716 billion, almost $725  billion if you tie in a lot of (INAUDIBLE) contracts to all of that.   General Jack Keane likes that, he joins us out of Washington, General, what  do you think?</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.) FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Well, it's a  step in the right direction, this is the second instalment of what I and  many describe as the Trump defense build-up, which is comparable to what  Ronald Reagan did.</p><p>But we've got to get out of a hole that we've been in for a decade plus,  with the defense budgets not being what they should be.  We're still the  primary military in the world, but the fact is, that our capabilities have  eroded significantly over time.  </p><p>And Russia and China in certain highly specialized areas have been able to  catch us and at certain other areas, they've actually gone past us and we  are in a big pile of competition with them.</p><p>So we need several years of this.  You know, be members of Congress that  don't want to do that, that's for sure, and this is going to have to be  argued, but this is, sort of, a down payment and we need to sustain it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, it comes at a time, though, when we have been demanding  -- you have been on this show and others talking a good deal about NATO,  paying its fair share.  You know, countries paying their fair share, we pay  over 70 percent of the costs of keeping our colleagues safe there.</p><p>Now, they talk about building a space force to add to that.  Are we ready  for that?  Do we have the money and commitment for that?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, the issue with space, certainly, is that the United States  has dominated space for years, but now, our adversaries are all up there  with us, and that's the reality that we are facing.  The space will be a  part of any conflict operation.  </p><p>Actually, maybe where the first shot gets fired, because if you take out  our satellites -- our satellites drive, not only GPS location, they drive  all of our communications and they drive our weapons telemetry.  It is what  enables us to bring precision ammunition to a target within about 15 to 25  meters with a degree of reliability of about 95 to 98 percent.</p><p>So, we can't operate without space and we've got to be able to control it.   All that said, Neil, I'm not certain we need a new service to be able to do  that, because when you create a service, you're buying into all of the  layers of bureaucracy that go with that service.</p><p>What we really need is a command focused on space like we've got a special  operations command that focuses on the needs of our special forces and  those kind of specialized troops.  We have problems not resource in those,  for years, and the Congress said, hey, stop it.</p><p>We're going to -- we're going to tell you to form a specialized command so  to give you the priority it deserves.  I think that's the right answer.   The center of services committee has said pretty much the same thing.   Let's not spend the extra dollars on the bureaucracy.  Let's spend the  money on the capability.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Our history suggests that we don't, you know, start a whole  new agency.  We just add it to the ones that we've got.  You know, while I  got you, General, we're getting word now that this incident in London,  where a driver tried to ran over pedestrians outside parliament.  </p><p>Now, he has been charged with terrorism and there are growing concerns that  it could happen again.  What do you make of this?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, this is -- this is certainly the pattern that's been  established.  These things are almost impossible to stop unless you've got  intelligence that leads up to it.  If he's operating by himself and he's  not in the network and he decides to do this on a particular day, thank  God, there were no explosives in the vehicle which would've made it  considerable worse.</p><p>But these are challenges that where every major city's going to continue to  face where the terrorists have their eye on trying to undermine that  government and make a name for what they're doing and for their cause.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, I always wondered, General, and I don't mean to, sort  of, say the market are the epicenter of everything, but they used to get  really rattled on these types of reports, not so much and these days, and  maybe in the last couple of years.  </p><p>It could be -- sadly, we're used to this sort of thing or the better, sort  of, big-picture view of that and we move on with our lives, but what do you  -- what do you make of that?  I'm not saying they are nonplus, but they  move onto other things, what do you think?</p><p>KEANE:  No.  I don't think so at all.  I think it's largely reflection, you  know, of societies at large, I mean, the people, sort of, get it.  You  know, they live in a major urban center.  There's millions of people there,  the likelihood of there being touched by something like this, is pretty  remote.  </p><p>They feel they can go on with their lives, get their kids to school, work  hard, recreate when they want to.  I mean, the rest of this day will be  normal in London, except for that one area where this took place at.</p><p>So, I think, the media is a bit of a reflection of the people and so is the  government.  And I think there's a -- there's a trust that these  governments and these police forces are working overtime to try to stop  these things and use the Intel collaboration that exists out there,  everybody's, sort of, focused on this.</p><p>So, I think there's some trust that's built up, also among the population.   And I -- and I do think it's a reflection of the maturity of a society  being able to cope with some evil in Senate, and recognizing the fact that  you're never going to be able to stamp it all out anyway.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a good point.  You know, General (INAUDIBLE) we mentioned  Turkey, and we know the economic impact and all that, but there was a move  afoot to say that Erdogan is power hungry.  The President there has  actually planted the seeds for this financial disaster that is now  reverberating worldwide, less so, today.  </p><p>And there's some advocating, you know what, you don't deserve to be in  NATO, what if we kicked them out, what would be the impact of that?</p><p>KEANE:  That would be a huge strategic mistake.  Listen, we've had almost a  70-year relationship with Turkey being a part of NATO.  They're the second  largest military in NATO.  They said at the strategic cross roads between  Europe and the Middle East.  And we should not make decisions on the  policies of one leader who is going to serve for a certain period of time.</p><p>And yes, he's more authoritarian.  He stripped away Democratic values in  that -- in that country.  He's aggravating us significantly over Syria, as  he's moved closer to Russia and to Iran, and he's certainly got our  President's attention when he imprisoned American citizen who resides in  Turkey on false charges.</p><p>So, yes, he's a -- he's a problem for us.  I think we can resolve this  thing, diplomatically, with Pastor Brunson, because of the President's  pressure that he's placed on Erdogan.  Erdogan is the problem that the  Turkish economy has had serious problems.  The President just exacerbated  it by imposing the tariffs on aluminum and steel.  The roots of it were  already there, as you know.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, General, always good catching up with you, thank you  very much.  </p><p>KEANE:  Good seeing you early in the morning here, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know about that.  But I do I appreciate that, my friend.   All right, we've got a lot more, coming up, including boycotting Sam Adams,  the beer, over supporting President Donald Trump.  Wow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the markets, again, unaffected by this latest charge  out of London, that the individual responsible for ploughing into a crowd  or trying to, outside of parliament, has been arrested on terrorist charge  here.  But, again, the markets moving on despite all of that, we are  following that.</p><p>We are also following reports of yet another firefighter dying in that  California wildfire; Cheryl Casone has more on that, hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, hey, Neil.  The firefighter was from Utah.  He was injured  while working on the massive Montecino Complex Fire.  He has not been  identified yet.  These fires now are taking a very grim toll on our first  responders.  He is the sixth firefighter killed battling blazes in the  state just this year.</p><p>Well, Yosemite Valley and Yellowstone Park is set to re-open to tourist  after a three-week closure.  Of course, that closure has cost the park  millions in lost revenue.  The fire that roared through 150 square miles in  the part is the largest ever in the Sierra National Forest.  Two  firefighters died battling that blaze.  </p><p>Well, army special services soldier killed in IED explosion in Afghanistan,  Sergeant First Class Reymund Transfiguracion died five days after that  blast occurred, Green Beret on patrol in Helmand Province.  The 36-year-old  previously honored with the bronze star and the purple heart.  </p><p>Well, you won't find the mayor of Summersville, Massachusetts drinking Sam  Adams beer.  Joseph Curtatone, says he's boycotting the beer after founder,  Jim Koch, he praised on President Trump at a dinner in New Jersey last  week.  The cost said that the Trump administration's tax cut plan will help  his company compete with foreign breweries.  Apparently, that was enough to  turn Curtatone into a (INAUDIBLE).  All right, then.  </p><p>And then, finally let's stay on beer theme, because here's a story about a  bear in search of a (INAUDIBLE).  Yes, it's true, Baron in Bristol,  Connecticut apparently thirsty for the belt beverage, wandered into a  liquor store yesterday -- and it was caught on tape.  The bear got through  the front door but a quick-thinking employee was able to lock the inside  store preventing the bear from getting any further inside the store.  A  customer, by the way, Neil, actually walked right to the front the door  unaware that he was standing right next to the beer.  But he, well, quickly  brought inside.  If the bear wants a beer, Neil, that's just what the bear  wants, can't argue with the bear.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You wouldn't argue there.  Just whatever you want.  Go ahead and  have it.  Real quickly, guys, before we cut to break here, I am interested  in your thoughts on the Turkey situation again, the lira were down a little  bit to five, six percent today, still down, really, from its top levels, 40  percent.  But what's going on here?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think, you know, maybe there's a pause in this run that  we've had on the lira, but Turkey's problems aren't over, and we have to  watch really carefully the negotiations between -- to the extent there are  any between the U.S. and Turkey on this pastor.  I think that's an  important event for Turkey (INAUDIBLE) gets resolved.  It looks like  Erdogan is digging his heels in and that's just going to worsen problems  for them.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Lindsey, if you think about, Erdogan and President Trump  were best of buds, right?  So, this does prove that the president is upping  the sanctions against Russia despite the so-called Vladimir Putin, that he  is quite capable of making his actions speak a lot louder than his words  but where is this all going?  </p><p>BELL:  Right, and there's global implications for that too, as you are  seeing in the currency market, for sure.  Well, the Bank of International  Settlement, they say, though, that the global exposure to loans in Turkey  is less than one percent.  So, hopefully this can stay contained but the  banks we start talking about earlier, in Europe, some of the banks Italy,  Spain, and France I think have the greatest exposure.  So, that would be  definitely an area to watch but I think that the contagion concern should  be limited.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, the other real interesting angle here is how does  the president respond to weakening currencies?  So, those are suggestion in  his tweet that he was doubling the tariffs because the currency had come  down so much so he wanted to ramp up the effect of the tariffs.  So, you  know, what happens if China's currency keeps goes down.  Do we ramp up our  tariffs in China, you know, what happens if the Canadian dollar softens  against the U.S.?  Do we find ways to ramp up, you know, steel tariffs on  the Canadians?  This is an approach to currencies and tariffs that we don't  usually see.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, and because of it -- had the flip side effect, right?  It  makes it better for them and their trade position.  </p><p>BELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Guys, thank you very much.  We are looking at Tiger  Woods, he didn't win this weekend but had one of best performances in close  to a decade, why that has been joy for golf T.V. ratings?  We'll explain  after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Tiger is back.  You know, at first, when I saw the  results of the championship, I thought Tiger had won given all the  coverage.  He didn't, but he has done the best he has done in, what, a  decade I guess.  Jared Max is here with more on that and the fallout.  Good  fallout, right?  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Yes, good fallout, Neil.   What an interesting story, Tiger Woods went from child prodigy to world  golf super hero and then he became villain of sorts, but now he's on the  comeback trail that it seems everybody wants to watch.  By Tiger Woods  contending for the top spot at the PGA championship this weekend, T.V.  ratings were their highest in nine years for a final round at the PGA  championship, 69 percent higher than last year. </p><p>Now, some have said, \"Why so much coverage of Tiger, what about Brooks  Koepka?  He won the Wanamaker trophy.\"  Well, President Trump showed love  yesterday, tweeting: \"Brook Koepka just won his third golf major and he did  it not only with his powerful game, but with his powerful mind.  He has  been a man of steel on the tour and will have many victories, including  majors ahead of him.  Congrats to Brooks and his great team on a job well  done.\"  </p><p>20-year-old Atlanta Brave rookie, Ronald Acuna did something yesterday only  three players had done before.  He let off a doubleheader against the  Marlins with his 16th home run of the year.  Now, the Braves won the game  nine to one.  He would also be the lead-off hitter in the second game.   Watch what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We wouldn't mind another one here in game two tonight.   Deep center!  First pitch!  Can you believe it?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Four players ever have hit home runs in both games of the double  header to lead off 6-1 if the Braves win that one and they top the Phillies  by one of the East.  So, four guys.  That's it.  It's pretty amazing that  Acuna Jr., this young star.  </p><p>And you know, they don't call Hot Lana for nothing.  Marlins' first-base  coach, Perry Hill called on an old trick that Pete Rose taught him, when  it's really warm and humid you put lettuce on your head under your hat, and  it keeps your head cool.  Anybody ever tried this?  The lettuce on the  head?  It works, I guess.  </p><p>Not only was Denver Broncos quarterback, Paxton Lynch, of first-round draft  pick two years ago booed off the field Saturday.  He was also demoted for  the third string quarterback, but then the Broncos fan started a GoFundMe  page to raise $600,000 to give to the team so they could buy the Lynch head  of his contract, ouch.  The GoFundMe page was up last night but now it's  down.  Check out these new football uniforms for Air Force.  It's the Air  Force power legacy series, and this year, it honors AC-130 aircraft.  We  get to see these alternate uniforms a lot of times and this one are shining  for Air Force ready for the college football season.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What is Tiger's next big tournament? </p><p>MAX:  Hopefully the Ryder Cup.  Yesterday he did not get named as one of  the automatics, but next month, there are four more names who will go if  it's U.S. against Europe, but the masters next year.  We set up here with  this performance.  What a cliffhanger for the first major next year, and he  will win again another major and more.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  This is golf that we are talking about?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a bold prediction.  I mean, that would be -- how old is  he now?  </p><p>MAX:  He's coming up on 43.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right, so to come back and win a major at that age -- </p><p>MAX:  Care to make it interesting?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'll take that bet.  I'll take that bet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, thank you very much.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Maybe we will with some lettuce on his head.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I didn't know that.  </p><p>BELL:  I never knew that either.  I will sit around my apartment with  lettuce on my head.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Omarosa, the latest to tape Donald Trump, had Michael  Cohen doing the same thing.  Why would people do that when they declare  that they are the closest and best of friend, and yet they keep taping him?   It used to be, in my day, the presidents were taping people who visited him  and not the other way around.  All right, we've got a lot more coming up  after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Good morning, everybody, happy to have you.  I'm Neil Cavuto in  for Maria Bartiromo.  We're seeing the lira at least out of Turkey rebound  a little bit here.  But again, even with today's five or six percent pop,  depending on this moving -- is still down 40 percent from its high a little  more than a few weeks ago.  But that was good enough to sort of add some  stability not only to our own futures market but certainly in Europe right  now in Asia overnight.  </p><p>It was a similar story, relief on a rally that might be tepid but good  enough to keep this rally going here, as it continues.  The Wall Street  opens up in about two and-a-half hours.  Meanwhile, Turkey is already  responding in kind to the United States' threat of doubling tariffs on  aluminum, metal-related products.  President Erdogan now saying that he  will go after electronic concerns of the United States, boycott those, you  know how this goes.

President  Erdogan now saying that he will go after electronics concerns of the United  States, boycott those; you know how this goes.  It's fueling and feeding a  sort of tit-for-tat here that could get worse before it gets better.</p><p>Someone who has been there and knows very much the move there, just got  back from there late last night, she's here with us now.  But she looks  very awake, I'm surprised.  Good mood -- could be just that she's just  heavily caffeinated.  Laura Wells joins us right now.</p><p>Laura -- good to have you.</p><p>LAURA WELLS, FREELANCE JOURNALIST BASED IN TURKEY:  Thank you for having  me.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is weird.  And I'm wondering, you were mentioning during the  break maybe it's this ongoing wrath that President Erdogan has for the  American position on this with the tariffs and everything else, even going  after President Trump.</p><p>Is that how Turkish citizens are seeing it, that it's our fault they're in  this trouble?  </p><p>WELLS:  At this point, largely.  President Erdogan and the ruling party  have been stoking the anti-Western sentiment for so long.  Right now Turkey  has particularly a lot of things, many gripes against the United States.</p><p>As you mentioned, the new increased tariffs, for instance; problems with --  it's not only Pastor Brunson.  It's also 12 Turkish-American dual citizens  who are in jail; three very long-term consulate employees who happen to be  Turkish citizens that are now in prison in Turkey.  And they did not let  the U.S. know beforehand.  Many are considered political prisoners at least  by the United States at this point.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We made a big beef of this only fairly recently.  So Turkish  citizens -- I mean, the runaway inflation, the problems with bank debt and  all that -- that was long before this, right?  </p><p>WELLS:  Most Turks really didn't know what was going on.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is that right?</p><p>WELLS:  Ninety percent of the press in Turkey is really pro-government.   It's controlled somehow directly or indirectly by the government.  So we're  not even seeing the exchange rate dollar to Turkish lira broadcast on some  of the networks anymore.  I mean this is a, you know, highly-filtered press  environment.  And really, about 50 percent of the population really  supports President Erdogan.  It's a highly nationalistic society.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So he's made the U.S. the bogeyman and they're buying that.  </p><p>WELLS:  Right.  Well -- and he's talked about the gripes with the United  States throughout the years.  So you have the fact that the U.S. is  supporting some of the Syrian Kurdish fighters in Syria.  And that's a  group which certainly Turkey has been taking on militarily over down there.   They took over Afrin and there's a lot of tension in Manbij down there.</p><p>You also have the fact that Turkey is trying to become more independent of  NATO and the U.S. and buying the weaponry or making the weaponry.  And  they're -- they've already signed agreements and tried putting money down  for the S-400 anti-missile defense system by Russia which no one has said  will be compatible with NATO.  And in fact, it might be able to break the  code of the stealth mode of the F-35 fighter jets.  So it really could be a  real threat to the United States and to NATO -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  -- which is why some are saying, you know, we're going to kick you  out of NATO.  Do you think that's likely?  </p><p>WELLS:  You know, that would be very difficult to do -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>WELLS:  -- especially with the ongoing sanctions with Iran and Turkey's a  key player right there.  They import a lot of gas and oil and have pretty  good relations with Iran.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, how did the bloom come off the rose here?  I mean Erdogan  and President Trump were very close.  He admired -- that is the President - - Erdogan's very tough leadership style and all that.  And then I don't  know whether it was the pastor issue, some of these other hostage issues  but then everything turned south fast.  </p><p>WELLS:  It's a confluence of issues.  We knew that the economy was going  down for many years.  If you talk to any economist, any analyst and  certainly in the past, President Erdogan finds someone to blame when things  start going awry.</p><p>Right now it's the United States.  In the past it's been the Netherlands.   It's been Germany.  Many -- again, many analysts are saying he's engaging  in hostage diplomacy.  And I think for a long time there were tensions  building between the two countries before President Trump.  And now it's  continued, it's really coming to a head right now.</p><p>And with this lira crisis, this is the time when, you know, the president  can capitalize on that and say look, this is what the United States is  doing, it's engaging in economic terrorism.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Whoever is at fault in the public's eye, they're seeing it at the  grocery store.  They're seeing, you know -- I was reading somewhere that  milk and bread prices are effectively doubling every week.  So I mean at  what point do they say we don't care whose fault it is, but can you, Mr.  President, solve it?  </p><p>WELLS:  We don't know.  His supporters are very loyal.  They stuck with him  through thick and thin.  You know, just a few years ago we had a rash of  terrorist attacks and they supported him.  They said this is what happens  when your party loses the majority.  And there was another snap election  and he regained that majority, his party did.  </p><p>And then he has changed the system effectively so he has sweeping powers  that no Western democracy knows.  So they've actually just rewarded him  each and every time anything happens.  So this crisis he might actually use  to his political advantage.  We'll just see.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So the idea that he would even be a duly elected leader for a set  period of time, he could be like -- you've got Chavez in Venezuela -- there  until the end.  </p><p>WELLS:  Very pragmatic businessmen and many others have pointed out the  fact that Turkey could be the next Argentina.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WELLS:  Venezuela -- that's an extreme case.  We'll have to see.  There's  many other things that Turkey does have, not the oil, but other things.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The lira and the tumbling of that currency, it doesn't seem that - - I know they put limits on how much people can take out of the country or  cash out but -- while it stabilized a little bit here, it just seems like a  band-aid solution to me.  </p><p>WELLS:  A lot of the things are.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>WELLS:  For instance, President Erdogan doesn't believe in the general  fiscal orthodoxy which is he believes that high interest rates create high  inflation and so he's always vowed to keep the interest rates quite low.   And that has become like a political slogan which has become popular  because people like to imagine that they can borrow.</p><p>There was almost no mortgages before President Erdogan for various reasons;  now people have.  But now you also have such a huge amount of corporate  debt and that's all denominated in foreign currencies -- it's usually  dollars or the euro.  And we may really see blood on the street with these  corporations.  They really make you wonder.</p><p>But President Erdogan always seems to have some sort of government  solution.  So whether it's the case of his political enemies where he  seized $15 billion worth of companies since the failed coup attempt.  Will  he seize others?  Will he give them, you know, an infusion of capital?   He's certainly done that for his friends or some sort of tax amnesty or  other amnesties.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Couldn't he run to Russia?  Couldn't he run to China?  Couldn't he  just all right, well I'll just -- I'll do my own thing with these guys.  </p><p>WELLS:  That's what he's already doing.  He's already building those  relations and that is what the West might lose.  What if Turkey with all of  the nuclear warheads, with the NATO bases, with the U.S. bases?  What if  they said we're on Russia's side, we're on China's side, we're on Iran's  side, et cetera -- what if that happens?  What will we do then?  I mean  there are others -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  How were you treated when you were there?  </p><p>WELLS:  Well, I've been living there for many years.  You know, in general  it's -- they don't even think I'm American.  They think I'm probably  British.  So that's actually a little bit easier.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>WELLS:  Although there's a lot of anti western sentiment again, stoked by  the president.  But in general, they're very nice people and they don't  necessarily assume.  But I haven't been in extremely conservative areas,  generally speaking.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Real quickly and finally President Trump's approach to this is  always using the economic lever, again these tariffs on metal, aluminum- related products.  He's played this out in China.  He's played this out  with Canada and Mexico.  It is his means by which he can extract  concessions or hopes to.</p><p>What do you think of that?  You talk to business types in the country --  what do they think of that?  That's a unique approach to solve a political  task (ph) by doing it this way.  </p><p>WELLS:  Sure.  Frustrated.  I don't think the timing of that tweet by  President Trump helped anything because it was playing into the hands of  President Erdogan who had already started setting this up saying look, the  U.S. is attacking us economically.  That doesn't mean it's a bad. </p><p>I think that President Erdogan will certainly respond well.  When Turkey  shot down a Russian aircraft, fighter jet that was flying in, that -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right, right, right.</p><p>WELLS:  -- Putin dealt with that with economic sanctions, even banned  flights into the country, he killed the tourism with Russian tourists.  He  even banned things like tomatoes because there's a lot of produce.</p><p>And also Russia provides Turkey with a lot of -- 60 percent of its natural  gas.  So -- and Turkey is dependent on energy, 100 percent dependent.  So  it was very effective and Putin was very, very tough with Erdogan.  He  backed down.</p><p>So it was a war of words, very similar to this.  So it is winnable but I  think a lot of it has to do with timing and more quiet power, rather than  loud power because President Erdogan will use anything to his favor if he  can.  He is very savvy politically with his base.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Neither leader strikes me as being quiet or a shrinking violet  type when it comes to our president and their president.  </p><p>WELLS:  Well, what I mean is -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I know what you mean.</p><p>WELLS:  -- it's because the tariffs maybe just not that day when there's a  true crisis in the lira.  But such measures, yes, they do work.  The common  business person in Turkey though is not very happy about it -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Sure.</p><p>WELLS:  -- and it increases their frustration with President Erdogan and  certainly there have been many business groups who have said please  stabilize the lira, please lower these terrible inflation rates at this  point and create better diplomacy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they're making it next to impossible for someone to get their  hands on other currencies, the dollar included?  </p><p>WELLS:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>WELLS:  Well, naturally and through other means, yes, because for instance  on Friday you couldn't even get into the apps.  You couldn't exchange  dollars.  There were long lines.  I mean this is -- it's very difficult.   So it's naturally difficult.</p><p>But yes, people are worried about a lot worse, if there are going to true  capital controls or not.  We'll deal with that when we come to it but yes,  I do know of business people who have money and they're thinking I might  have to move this out in case, you know, there are more measures to come.   Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Amazing.  Laura -- thank you very, very much.  An encyclopedia on  all this -- holy Toledo.</p><p>WELLS:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  We're monitoring that here and again just to share  though.  If there were a panic sort of sentiment building about Turkey even  with the improvement today, the markets have a funny way of showing it.</p><p>What's more the markets have a funny way of showing what appears now to be  a terror incident in London early this morning.  A car tried to crash near  Parliament through a gate and run down some folks.  No one was injured,  we're told, in this.  Nevertheless, that gentleman has been arrested on  terrorism charges.</p><p>But again, the stuff that used to rattle markets when we got even a  headline, a whiff of this, not the case today.  And as you can see, with  our futures, the European markets, the Asian markets -- virtually all are  up.</p><p>More with this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Man oh, man -- when it rains, it pours.  News of a bridge collapse  in Italy.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has more on that.  Hey -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey.</p><p>We're getting some breaking news in here from Italy.  We want to bring you  what we know at this point.</p><p>This happened near Genoa, this is northern Italy.  There is a picture that  we found on Twitter of the bridge collapse.  There were many homes and  buildings and other structures underneath the bridge.</p><p>Now a news agency is quoting an Italian ambulance service saying that  dozens of people are dead.  But again these details may change.  This is  breaking news we're getting.</p><p>There's a large section of the bridge missing.  Photographs show huge  pieces of rubble on the ground underneath all of it.  We are following the  story, trying to get more details.  Again breaking news out of Italy --  this could be a major disaster in northern Italy.  Again, we're trying to  confirm what we can.</p><p>Another story we're following also out of Europe -- a man is under arrest  for crashing his car into security barriers outside the House of  Parliament.  This happened in London earlier this morning.  He's described  only as being in his late 20s.  He was arrested on suspicion of terrorism.</p><p>Now, no weapons were found in the car.  Scotland Yard says pedestrians and  cyclists were hit but police do not believe any of the injuries are life- threatening.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two people have been taken to hospital.  One man has  already been discharged and one woman remains in hospital being treated for  serious but, thankfully, nonlife-threatening injuries.</p><p>Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method and this being  an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident and the  investigation is being led by officers from the counterterrorism command.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, streets in the surrounding area are blocked off and the  nearby Westminster underground station still remains closed at this hour as  they approach their rush hour.  The area of the site of a terror attack in  March of 2017 when Khalid Massoud (ph) plowed a car in the crowd on  Westminster bridge killing four people at the time.</p><p>Well, one week later, Elon Musk is providing new information about a  surprise tweet on taking Tesla private.  In a blog, Musk says that Saudi  Arabia's Sovereign Wealth Fund has approached him several times about  providing financial support for the buyout.  He also says he is working  with some big name advisors.  He tweeted last night, \"I'm excited to work  with Silver Lake and Go Goldman Sachs as financial advisers; plus Wachtel,  Lipton as legal advisers on the proposal to take Tesla private.\"  Musk also  says the deal would require far less than $70 billion -- Tesla's market  value based on Musk's stated target price of $420 per share.</p><p>Well, the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that our addiction to the exclamation  point is causing anxiety when e-mailing with coworkers or bosses.  Some  people say they feel anxious when their exclamation points aren't  reciprocated.  In the article, the Journal also argues that our overuse of  exclamation points makes them less effective -- Neil.</p><p>So I guess when I sent you that e-mail and I said \"thanks, exclamation  mark,\" I'm sorry if I caused you any stress whatsoever.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what's weird -- when it's all caps and exclamation  points, then it's like screaming, right.  </p><p>CASONE:  Right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's not good.</p><p>CASONE:  Maybe, yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.</p><p>Kat -- do you buy that?</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I don't buy that.  I think  that if you're getting stressed out by a punctuation mark of any sort, then  you probably have some other issues.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  But it's something you said -- be careful how you frame  things.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I never  use exclamation points.  This is one of my pet peeves.  I think they're  way, way overused.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You do.</p><p>TIMPF:  Then you're annoyed with me because I definitely overuse them.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  Every other word kind of thing.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Sometimes multiple ones.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.</p><p>BELL:  Sorry -- my apologies to anyone I've offended.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's causing me personal stress.  </p><p>BELL:  Sorry -- Jon.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't want to drop any hints here but this Internet thing is  going to be big.  It's just going to be big, just so you know.</p><p>All right.  We have a lot more coming up, including millennials who are not  saving for retirement and that's not a shocker.  The fact that they still  want to retire young is.</p><p>I'm not going to pick on Kat after this but I am going to pick on Kat after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Young people, millennials -- they have no retirement  savings, not an early prospect that they're going to start saving yet they  do talk increasingly about wanting to retire by age 60.</p><p>Chris Hogan, Ramsey Solutions financial expert and author of the upcoming  book, \"Everyday Millionaires\", on what's going on here.  That just seems to  be contradictory on just the surface, Chris -- but what's going on here?  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  I think you have people  that are expressing their desires, Neil.  And it's good to dream.  I just  think when you have an expectation without a plan, it's called a thought.</p><p>So I want to grab these young people and continue to guide them.  I want  them to have those dreams.  I want them to have that expectation.  But  we've got to get to work.</p><p>And I'm talking to these young people on my show.  And I'm hearing from  them, they're wanting to learn.  They want to know what to do.  And I'm  trying to guide as many people as I can.  </p><p>BELL:  So where do you -- this is Lindsey Bell -- where do you tell them to  put their money?  Is it equities, given that we're about to be in the  longest bull market of all time?  What's your advice?  </p><p>HOGAN:  I think we have to help them understand how money works, first.  So  that is, we've got to get on a budget.  You've got to start to tell money  where to go instead of wondering where it went.</p><p>And then we've got to get out of debt.  Debt is what's keeping young people  from realizing and living a lot of their dreams.  So I want them to  understand the reality.  You know, they teach us in grad school that debt  is a tool.  No it's not.</p><p>Debt is a limiter.  It keeps you from living your dreams.  So once I get  them to that point where they're out of debt, then I talk about investing.</p><p>And it's very important.  We've got to get in with the stock market.  But I  want them to understand what they're investing in and also the expectation  from that investment.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So Chris -- the data in the study is that I think it was 66  percent of millennials aren't saving for retirement.  It doesn't seem that  surprising to me, given that, you know, a lot of people are just getting  started in their 30s.  You know, they're going out, they're buying homes,  they're starting families.</p><p>I mean a lot of my personal savings didn't start happening until the 40s.   So are they really that far behind?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I think America as a whole is extremely behind.  And the best  way to stop a cycle is to educate people a lot earlier.  So I want them in  their 20s to get on this plan and start to invest.</p><p>We all know money's two best friends are compound interest and time.  But  according to this study, 71 percent of millennials want to understand how  to reach their financial goals; 65 percent want to learn how to budget and  save for retirement; 55 percent want to understand about debt.</p><p>So they have this desire.  We just have to guide them.  And here's the  problem.  If parents don't know and can't share the information, then these  young people are left in the dark.  So I want to encourage them to get  their own education, find the knowledge, reach out and learn so you can  apply it in your life.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Chris -- I know that one big problem for young people is student  loan debt.  What do you suggest people do about student loan debt?  I think  that that really, really keeps it pretty impossible to save for a lot of  millennials.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Student loan debt is a massive situation.  And we've got to help  young people understand.  There are avenues to get to higher education  without signing loan documents.  So I encourage them to look at where they  are, understand the debt, that it's not a friend.  But I want them to  attack it.</p><p>And we teach attacking debt, smallest to biggest.  It's called the debt  snowball.  You want to attack the little one first and then move down the  line from there.  But we can't allow it just to hang around for 15 or 20  years.  That chokes out your opportunity to grow money.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know Chris -- one of the thing I think that's a constant no  matter the generation, it's really -- and you've repeated this enough --  it's about money in, money out.  And I've seen millionaires lose a lot of  money because they're spending like, you know, tens of millionaires.  And  then they exceed whatever they have coming in and a lot more is going out.</p><p>It seems like a basic concept that's lost on not just millennials -- a lot  of generations because a lot of those kids' parents are in the same bind.  </p><p>HOGAN:  No, you're absolutely right.  And Neil -- it really boils down to  controlling lifestyle.  Too many people allow their lifestyle to be  determined by their income.  And the problem is human nature is to spend.</p><p>But I think there's another side of it too.  We want to live and we want to  live well.  So I think just starting to control it -- this is not an age  issue.  This is not a Gen-Z or millennial or baby boomer -- this is a  people situation because money is something that all of us need to rely on  and learn how to use properly.  </p><p>And I think we can guide people, we just have to keep giving them the right  information.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But what I don't understand, Chris -- and we were touching on the  outset here -- a lot of these same young people are saying all right, I  don't have the pot (INAUDIBLE) but I still want to retire by 60 and  preferably sooner.  What do you tell them if you have a one-on-one with  them or you meet with them at your book signing?  What do you say?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I tell them this -- Neil.  A dream without a plan is called a  wish.  And so wanting to retire at 60, that's a good thing but what are you  doing about it?  You know, I think it's unrealistic for us to expect great  results and to live a good life without hard work and sacrifice.</p><p>So I'm grabbing them and I'm guiding them.  I want them to understand the  world has a plan for your money if you don't.  We just have to wake up, get  in tune and start doing the common sense things -- getting on a budget,  getting out of debt, building an emergency fund and starting to invest.   Investing small can lead to big gains.  We just have to be consistent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Lindsey -- you were touching on it too, during the  (INAUDIBLE) conversations but many younger people are not confident that  Social Security will be there for them.  That a lot of these other  entitlements or whatever you want to call them that are given for their  parents' or grandparents' generation might not be there for them.  So what  do they do?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Now, the young people today, we're left up to our own will to  save.  And Chris -- I would just ask you, you know, individuals aren't  saving now, is it because -- I know you mentioned that there's some  restrictions to investing in these 401-k plans.  Is it just that they have  to pay down their school debt?  Is it that they just don't make enough as  others that have come out of college?  What's the driving force behind the  lack of savings?  </p><p>HOGAN:  I think it's a multitude of those issues that you just mentioned.   I think it is a lack of knowledge and understanding just how important it  is, a lack of false reliance on Social Security that it's going to be  there.  And we all know, I mean, it's a few votes away from being majorly  adjusted.</p><p>But I think at the end, I want people to just take control of what they can  control.  This is -- again, getting yourself out of debt and that might  mean taking on an extra job.  It might mean making some sacrifices.  But  again, I've never heard anybody that got out of debt that's gone through  financial peace university.  I've never heard anybody tell me, Chris -- I'm  really mad that I got out of debt.  I want to keep giving my money away.   That doesn't happen.</p><p>So we've got to learn these basic skills but keep applying them.  Learning  them is not enough.  Application is where progress happens.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what's so threatening about you -- Chris in these one on  one conversations?  You have -- you're a great writer, that's a given.  But  you also have such a powerful voice that I would do anything you told me to  do.  I would just say all right, all right, I'll start saving if that's  what it takes.  Just don't -- </p><p>HOGAN:  Neil -- I'm going to use whatever tools I can to encourage people.   Just don't ask me to sing.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.  I have a feeling that you have a very good voice  for that.  Chris -- thank you very, very much.</p><p>All right.  We've got a lot more coming up, including this one that's  rather revealing for some Democrats, many of whom like socialism over  capitalism.  And it just doesn't extend to this one particular sensation in  New York.  I'll explore after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I am not Maria Bartiromo.  But amazing facsimile.  Welcome  everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto, happy to be here in her sched while she's  taking a deserved break.  </p><p>We do have some breaking news in Italy.  This bridge collapse that now has  at least 10 people known dead, could be others.  Many are missing as well.  </p><p>And meanwhile, on the financial markets here, the lira, not the Italian  lira.  Of course, we're talking about now, about what's happening  particularly in Turkey where that currency is under extreme pressure.  Re- downed a little bit today but it is still off 40 percent from its highs.   Nevertheless, the fact that the free fall stopped and even slightly  reversed was good enough to send our futures northward as well as stocks in  Europe and of course, in Asia.  So, we're keeping track of that.  </p><p>We're also keeping track of Democrats who might be driving a hard left and  a lot of them happy to do so.  Many positive about socialism, liking it  more than capitalism.  I don't know whether Juan Williams is in that group.   A \"THE FIVE\" co-host joins us right now.  </p><p>What is going on with that?  I mean, I know the numbers are all over the  map.  But when they were asked, what are you more comfortable with, I think  that's how it was framed, they said socialism?  What did you make of that?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think you have to really dig  a little deeper here.  The questions about socialism, so much gets labeled  socialism or progressivism.  But I think what's going on in the country  Neil, especially among the younger generation.  It's not about confiscation  of wealth.  It's not about nationalization of industries, it's about a  social safety net.  And when it comes to the cost of health care, even  prescription drugs, the cost of housing, the cost of education, more and  more young people think the government has a legitimate role in providing  them with some either safety net from falling or support so they can rise.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, when people say socialism, do they really know what  socialism is?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't think they do.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Means I mean -- you know, when we think of the Soviet Union,  that's a different kind of socialism.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right, well, that's communism even.  But no, they're not  thinking in those terms.  I don't think they want government in their life  telling them what they can do in terms of entrepreneurship or who are the  winners and losers.  </p><p>What they want is an era of very high income inequality some protection  about -- against being left behind.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  They're not going to get it.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think -- you know what?  This is interesting.  Because  now, if you want to talk Democratic Party politics, you really have to  understand the popularity of things like a guaranteed income.  Especially  in an era when it's harder and harder for those who are at the lower end of  the wage earning scale to really compete and say, for instance, this is  August, I have enough money to take time off to go on a vacation.  I think  we're getting to a position where fewer and fewer the young people feel  they're in that position.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do they figure out how to pay for that?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, you got to work hard.  You have to have some luck.  You  got to build a resume.  I think all this things are true.  I've always been  an advocate of saying to people -- you know, don't do anything until you  get an education.  Certainly don't get married, don't have children until  you're married.  Because I think the two incomes help to provide that  safety net on a personal basis.  </p><p>But if you're talking in terms of the politics, you go back to the Bernie  Sanders of the world, and Neil, I think it's also interesting that a lot of  the Bernie Sanders people are very close on the scale to Donald Trump  people in terms of that popular sense that wait, why shouldn't we limit  trade to protect some jobs for hard working, blue collar people in this  country.  Why shouldn't we do something to make sure that young people can  afford health care if we do much the same for the elderly in terms of  Medicare?  What about social security?  </p><p>A lot of young people don't believe it will be there for them.  So it's  interesting, the seniors would say, you young Democrats, you younger  generation, you're so interested in socialism and I think the younger  people would shoot back and say wait a minute, you have government  protected income once you hit a certain age in this country.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Safety nets are one thing, right?  And I think that in our  government system now we have safety nets.  I don't know why go all the way  radical and say socialism.  I want socialism.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think it's -- I think it's a label, as I said at the  start.  I think that if you actually said to them this is what socialism  is, young people, it means that the government is going to nationalize your  industries, we're going to look like Venezuela, they would say, no, that's  not what I'm talking about.  I think they believe in the American  capitalistic dream.  They just want to be sure that they're not being left  behind.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Could I interrupt you real quick.  Because I know, as soon as you  set up here apparently the president saw you.  And we have our first  presidential tweet.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Neil, President Trump  just tweeted four minutes ago about Omarosa Manigault-Newman of course, who  departed the White House last year and just wrote a book.  When you give a  crazed crying low life a break and give her a job at the White House, I  guess it just didn't work out.  Good work by General Kelly for quickly  firing that dog.  </p><p>It's already got nearly 2,000 retweets and 4,500 likes, Neil.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  And one of the tapes he expressed surprise I think Cheryl, that  she had been fired by General Kelly.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, and one of the (INAUDIBLE) said it was between the two of  them.</p><p>TIMPF:  Sad to see her go and he didn't love that she was leaving.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>TIMPF:  Seems a little bit different now, doesn't it?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes it does.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Juan I'm sorry, I knew you wanted to squeeze that tweet in  there.  So, we did -- </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'll be delighted, although, again.  You know, you just wonder,  dog, what is he thinking?  Doesn't he know he's president?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you think of these tweets?  They go with no abandon, on  and on.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think -- you know, the best light I could shine on it,  Neil, is that he is himself.  That's Donald Trump.  That's what he's  thinking.  I just wish that the impulse controls were a little stronger and  I think that it's offensive.  When even though she is not someone who you  would consider a Trump supporter at the moment, she's turned on him, you  could call it all a traitor.  </p><p>But I don't know why you would stoop to the level of calling somebody a  dog, and especially in a situation where his language often -- he knows how  people may react.  So, is it intentional?  I don't know.  I just think it's  not good.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, and (INAUDIBLE) you and I mentioned it before but she taped  him.  Michael Cohen, former president's lawyer taped him.  Why do they do  that?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  God if I know.  You know --</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't mean to put you on the spot.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it -- I think it's just the kind of culture of the  moment.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's kind of like -- you know, an -- the reality show White  House, that's just the way people operate.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  But doing it in the situation  room, that's a major issue, especially for our foreign intelligence  partners.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I thought alarms went off if you did that in the situation.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I thought you couldn't even bring a phone into the situation  room.  </p><p>BELL:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But -- so, the question is was General Kelly just using that as  a private space to fire somebody?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, do you think that exchange, she said was threatening?   Omarosa (INAUDIBLE), it seemed pretty -- </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, I mean, maybe.  She said she felt as if she was being held  prisoner.  I don't know how that works.  I don't know if you can -- I guess  you could secure the door and not let people out.  But again, that's in her  opinion.  I don't know that that's the normal circumstances.  As a  reporter, I just walk through the situation room and nobody said hey, you  can't get out of here or anything like that to me.  But I don't -- I bet  they have all sorts of James Bond type devices in there.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But you and I we're old enough to remember presidents taping those  who came to the White House.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now the people go into the White House and taping the president,  it is weird.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, but what's worse than that is they're taping each other.  </p><p>CAVTO:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right?  So it's like, there's no sense of trust or camaraderie.   That's what's alarming to me.  Because that's supposed to be a team.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But the president has also suggested that he's taping people,  right?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, you're right -- you're right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  He suggested that he was taping Comey.  So, that's why I said,  it's just kind of -- it's the world they operate in.  I mean, when you  bring someone like Omarosa into the White House, that's the kind of  behavior that you're going to get.  And now the question is why would you - -</p><p>CAVUTO:  What was Omarosa doing in the situation room to begin with, right?  </p><p>BELL:  But what happens to Omarosa after this?  Is there any repercussions  for doing that?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Good question.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Remember, a moment ago Neil said he and I are old enough to  remember.  I'm old enough to think, I don't know why this woman is famous  in the first place?  Exactly what did she do other than be famous? </p><p>TIMPF:  She's famous for being famous.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, she's a reality -- she's the reality T.V. villain, right?   And then he gives her the job.  She had senior staff status, $175,000  salary.  You can't get much higher in the White House, other than the  president, 400.  So here -- and then she says -- the president says no one  liked her, everyone thought she was vile and this and that but she said  nice things about me.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think the question you're asking is she prosecuted as a  result of this.  I mean, clearly she breached some security protocol.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there was -- if there was a situation being discussed in  there or it was national security issues.  I don't think her being firing  her as a national security.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, but taping in the situation room.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is there a law that says you can't -- to Jon's point, tape in the  situation room?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't think so.  But I think there's a protocol if they  take away your phones.  And in this White House at some point, they started  --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Did you seek up a little bit I just want to make sure I get that.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  Don't take away my phone.</p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, we were talking about the president.  He's all in  political mode here, running for re-election.  And he blasted the present  governor of New York State.  I want you to respond to this one.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He called me and he said  I'll never run for president against you.  Please do it.  Please.  </p><p>Anybody that runs against Trump suffers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's true.  I know he said almost the same thing when Oprah was  considering running, right?  What did you make of that?  It's going to be a  crowded field whoever runs against him.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I was -- I was interested in the idea that he thought he  could win as governor of New York.  This is a pretty blue state, New York.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I thought he was just talking about if he was the nominee.  No?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, if he ran for governor, right?  Is that what --</p><p>TIMPF:  As president.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I interpret it as running for president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, no.  But earlier he said he would have run for governor and  he could have beaten Cuomo.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I see -- I see.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And then he decided he's going to run for president and he beats  everybody on the Republican and Hillary Clinton Democratic side.  But I  think that he has tremendous political confidence.  I'm --</p><p>BELL:  You could call it that.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  And also, you know some good intuition.  But I was thinking  could he really win in New York State?  I don't know.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is a divided field though.  If they can't clear a path and  settle on one person, you could have what?  A couple dozen people running.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  It's really early.  But the question is who is the leader of the  Democratic Party?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's not that early, Juan.  We've got a graphics package ready to  go.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Ready to take in all that.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Is Cuomo a real contender?  Do you think he would jump in?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, I think that he has that desire.  I think he has the  ambition.  And I think he has in his opinion the track record.  We'll see  how that goes.  </p><p>The question is, is he sufficiently combative and attractive to the rest of  the country?  To really --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Because that's what you need a combative personality who will  punch back full heavy weight mode with the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  I mean, to me, Omarosa, even though I think she has zero  credibility, and I wouldn't read this book.  I wouldn't buy this book.  She  is in full combat mode with President Trump at the moment.  And it's  captured national attention -- T.V. attention, especially in a way that you  wouldn't anticipate.  You need that element if you are going to go into the  school yard with a fight.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's going to be no higher ground in 2020.  It's going to  be a school yard fight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- I think, and look at the -- you know, it's always  true that ads, especially negative ads, have tremendous power, opposition  research and the like.  But wow, 2020 is going to go nuclear.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And the question is where is the passion going to be in the  Democratic party?  Is it the hard left side?  Socialist side?  Or is it the  -- you know, the Bidens and all who worry that that is going too far  afield.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't -- I mean, to me what you look at is the record  right now going into this midterms, even as we talk about the far left,  Alexandria Ocasio.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  You know where the power is in sort of mainstream, Democratic  Party and especially women who are doing well in these congressional  districts.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Buddy, thank you very, very much.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Nice to see you all this morning.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Juan Williams.  </p><p>And we have a lot more coming up, including a 6-year-old girl who orders  $350 in toys off of Amazon.  And her parents were so surprised.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the president added a tweet on that London attack right  now.  Cheryl Casone with more on that.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Right, hey, Neil.  So, here's what he just wrote literally about  five minutes ago.  Another terrorist attack in London, these animals are  crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength.  Of course,  we're following that breaking news out of London, a man in a car hitting  the gates at parliament.  </p><p>We've also got another breaking news story we're following out of Europe  this morning.  It's developing at this hour.  This is now in Italy.   Italy's Transport minister just saying this bridge collapsed there could be  an immense tragedy.  The Morandi Bridge collapsing earlier today in Genoa  Italy, this is Northern Italy.  Seven -- excuse me, sources say that 10  people are dead, as many as 20 vehicles also apparently involved.  Now,  here's what we just found, there was a before picture to your left, an  after picture to your right of what that bridge looks like.  Note all the  structures underneath the bridge.  Of course, we're following this breaking  news out of Italy.  We'll get more information as it becomes available to  us here.  </p><p>Well, back here at home, the FBI is warning banks that cyber crooks are  plotting a major heist.  The website krebsonsecurity is reporting that the  scheme that's known as an ATM cashout.  It's a mall where the attacks can  steal millions in minutes.  The FBI alerted banks last Friday.  In the  minute of the crime could take place in the coming days.  It's advising  banks to beef up security measures.</p><p>Well, Consumer Reports testing five mobile P2P services.  And they rated  Apple Pay the highest overall.  Consumer report says that Apple pay scored  excellent or very good marks in key protection measures of payment  authentication and data privacy.  Apple says there were about 1 billion  Apple Pay transactions in the last quarter.  Shares of that company up 23  percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Every parent looks forward to their children's first words,  first steps, what about their first Amazon purchase?  Yes.  This 6-year-old  girl ordered $350 worth of toys from Amazon.  Here's a picture of little  Caitlin standing next to her treasure being dropped off at her home.   Really as tall as she is.  Look how happy she is.  She was originally  allowed to order one Barbie doll of the website for her birthday.  But she  later returned, decided to fill her cart with lots of pages, toys, video  games, board games.  And then of course, she chose next day delivery.  </p><p>Her parents unfortunately, weren't so excited and they have spoiled her  plans.  They returned everything except the Barbie doll, Neil.  But you  know, way to go there, Caitlin.  </p><p>TIMPF:  If I would have done that, I wouldn't have been able to keep the  Barbie.  I would have been in trouble.  </p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>BELL:  You would have been grounded for a week.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Yes, I've been grounded for Barbie.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She's 6 years old.  How did she do this?  </p><p>BELL:  I thought it was OK.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Really?  OK, I just thought -- I don't know.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Modern life lessons.  That's a -- that's a great one.  You  can't just order whatever you want off of the internet, it's not a gift  that keeps giving.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We're running a debt.  We do it in this country.  All right,  that's wild.  </p><p>All right, a parent warning about a Momo, it's a viral challenge right now.   This is extremely scary.  And your own kids could be vulnerable.  The story  you're not hearing that you should.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  This is kind of creepy.  But if you've been following this viral  Momo challenge, it's a threat to children.  Here now to explain is Titania  Jordan, the Chief Parenting Officer over at Bark.  Titania, what is this  all about?  </p><p>TITANIA JORDAN, CHIEF PARENTING OFFICER, BARK:  Thank you for having me and  great question.  So, the Momo challenge is essentially a viral phenomenon  that initiated out of South America where children will accept a friend  request via an unknown number on WhatsApp and then be led through a series  of violent acts and prompts that ultimately end with a request to take  their lives.  So of course it's very scary and not something that any  parent wants their child to be engaged in.  </p><p>BELL:  So, it's Lindsey Bell here.  I just have a question.  If this is on  WhatsApp, why hasn't WhatsApp reacted and removed the number?  I mean, this  has been going on I think for a couple months, correct me if I'm wrong.   You know, I know they've come out and said that users are recommended to  block the phone number if this request comes through.  But why is it on the  user?  Why is it on the user or not their responsibility?  </p><p>JORDAN:  That's a great question and I hope that the team at WhatsApp is  taking active steps to block this phenomenon.  That said, with the nature  of copycat and virality -- you know, it's not just one number.  There are  multiple numbers that are popping up, there's one from Japan, and one from  South America and one from another country.  It's just -- it's spiraling  faster than honestly than they can control.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, are there signs out there that kids are actually engaging  in this and take in, following all these like really dangerous challenges  that this thing is posing to them?  </p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.  So we know of one case, again in South America, where a girl  did take her own life and signs point to the fact that she was.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  OK, Jesus.</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes, and there are warnings posted -- you know, on certain police  Twitter accounts across the world saying do not let your child engage in  this.  </p><p>TIMPF:  But how -- what can parents do?  I mean, how are they supposed to  know if their children are involved in something like this?  It could be  kind of hard.  Are there any signs?  </p><p>JORDAN:  Absolutely, yes.  So, the first thing to do is to always have an  ongoing, open and honest conversation with your child about what they're  doing online.  If you never talk about it with them, this sort of thing can  come and hit you by surprise.  </p><p>The second thing to do is to use a monitoring service.  You can use Bark  which monitors WhatsApp and can alert you to problematic issues that your  child is encountering.  </p><p>And then also, look for signs of -- you know, distress in your child,  dropping grades, loss of appetite, seemingly withdrawn or agitated.   Especially after being on their smartphone, that's a clear warning sign  that something's wrong and you need to talk to them about it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, (INAUDIBLE).  Titania, thank you very, very much.  It's scary  stuff, and then, stuff our kids can be exposed to.  If only we knew about  it, well now, some of us do.  </p><p>All right, an update on what's going on in Turkey right now, what's going  on with the lira, what is going on right now with Tesla as well.  We're  going to follow the developments around that and whether Elon Musk went a  little too far talking about -- well, who's lining up to financially  support his move to go private.  All that coming up.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA,  she's on vacation, I'm here.  You'll have to deal with it, America.

Happy to have you  with us.  I'm Neil Cavuto in for Maria Bartiromo.  Some breaking news out  of Italy.  A major bridge collapse there.  At least 10 have been killed and  as Cheryl Casone reported a little while ago there were a lot of  structures, building and what have you underneath that bridge.  Still no  update on people that could be missing and god knows what else.</p><p>Also keeping track of what could have been pretty bad terror attack in  London didn't end that way though a car crashed into a barrier near  parliament.  So far no reports of injuries but what would should have  caught up and then markets, well (INAUDIBLE) reaction to all of that.   Meanwhile, a rebound in the Turkish lira might have been a reason for that.   Futures pointing higher as well as the European markets and the Asian  markets just on the belief.</p><p>And maybe the worst is over for Turkey.  That might be a bit of a leap here  but we shall see.  We've got Fox contributor Kat Timpf joining me, Wall  Street Journal global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath, and CFRA investment  strategist, Lindsey Bell.  In the meantime, I do want to look at this  tariff thing for both sides here.  Business that benefit, business that do  not.  Adam Shapiro is live in Marston, Missouri with the former first.   Adam?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Neil, we are at Magnitude 7  aluminum plant.  This plant was shut down for two years, Magnitude 7 bought  it and may because of the tariffs has been able to bring 375 people back to  work.  They're looking for another 150.  And when they get all of this up  and running perhaps in the next year, it could be back in full employment  almost 900 people.</p><p>Take a look at what they do here, the video we shot where they make  aluminum.  There were only a 20 percent roughly capacity right now and it's  the tariffs that CEO Bob Prusak will tell you that made the difference.   It's only in June that they started to ramp-up production, for shipment of  aluminum in two years went out of this plant just three weeks ago.  Here is  what Mr. Prusak told me about the importance of the tariffs on aluminum. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOB PRUSAK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MAGNITUDE 7 METALS:  It also gives  this plant a, you know, a viable history.  If we have tariffs we're going  to be here operating. Whether that's two years, four years, it gives us  that certainty. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So Neil, as we talked about how the 375 people have come back to  work here, these are jobs that pay anywhere from $20.00 to $30.00 dollars  an hour.  I spoke to one man, he worked 15 years at this plant with the old  company when it went bankrupt.  He was out of work two years, he's come  back to work and clearly for Kevin Tucker this a positive.  Here's what he  told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN TUCKER, RETIRED EMPLOYEE:  It's a big plus.  You know, China floods  the market with metal, the tariffs help stop that and that's what we need.   We need to get more aluminum industry and steel industry back up in the  United States.  Get the business back here so it can be bought here instead  of coming from overseas. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, Neil, clearly the people here very happy with the tariffs  because this plant alone could have an impact on the local economy of more  than $300 million.  But the tariff story has another side.  We're going to  heading up the road to another factory where about 100 people have been  laid off because of tariffs, that is mid-continent now.  We're going to  talk to those people.</p><p>But as I talk about this, I want to show you something, just the process of  making aluminum as we zoom into this pod right here they're making aluminum  there, there are 174 of these just on this one line, 2000 degrees.  That's  what's going on there.  This did not take place until June, and the people  here as business heats up, they are thrilled.  Neil, back to you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Adam.  Thank you very, very much.  Adam Shapiro.  Let's  talk to California Congressman Darrell Issa about the trade stuff,  everything that's going on in politics, you name it.  Congressman, it's  always good to have you.  Thank you for taking the time.  </p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  Neil, thanks for having me on.  And if  I can play off of what you just teed up, you know, I think for the American  people that it's hard to understand that you can have both gaining and  losing jobs unless you understand that the market distortion, the fact is  you couldn't compete against aluminum being dumped into our country below  its fair which is what the study found that led to that tariff.</p><p>And at the same time, realize that a nail production or some other industry  might have built its production around low cost below cost steel.  But  that's for real what we're dealing with.  And so there's going to be market  distortions.  The goal though is to have other countries sell their  products not by dumping them and America competing fairly.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But that might not be the result. right?  I mean when we see a  tariffs imposed on an industry in response to tariffs imposed on an  industry back-and-forth and the tit-for-tat.  It gets out of control,  right?  All of a sudden to say aluminum or steel we have adversely impacted  scores of other businesses.  So how can that be a net -- a net good?  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, Neil, all wars end.  The question isn't war -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  We've waiting for this one to end.  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, this has been pretty short so far but the fact is that war  ends in peace, the question is what are peace?  In case of trade is will we  have a real reform to a distorted system including the WTO system.  Will we  in fact for example, where the President said, look, I will drop my 2-1/2  percent historic tariff on cars if Europe will drop its 10 percent on our  vehicles.  You know, American-made Toyotas, made in Kentucky see a 10  percent tariff trying to sell into Europe while a BMW made in Europe comes  in a 2-1/2 percent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Congressman -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ISSA:  Where is the fairness?</p><p>CAVUTO:  -- right?  I mean, when it comes to like trucks at all and leave  both 20 percent tariffs on those, so who are we to judge?  </p><p>ISSA:  I think there is a good -- a good example where for a long time we  propped up the pickup truck industry and people start asking why, why did  we do it?  Yes, there are historic distortions.  In general though, the  United States has the lowest tariffs of any major power in the world and  all we're really trying to do, I believe the President is trying to do, is  to get past two things, below market dumping and trade a barriers that are  usually tariffs.</p><p>But in case the Europeans sometimes, it simply prohibitions.  They won't  buy our meat, they won't buy our GMO, \"corn and soybeans.\"  Those are  problems that are part of the peace talks that I want to get to.  I --  look, I voted for every single Free Trade Agreement since I've been in  Congress.  I actually spoke on behalf of NAFTA with Mexico, on behalf of  the chamber in San Diego.  I'm a free trader.</p><p>But now that we're in this battle, it's got to be a battle that ends in a  fair peace agreement.  And the question is how do we get to it as quickly  as possible?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Congressman, it's Lindsey Bell  here.  Just wondering, how long are you willing to let that battle go on  for?  Because with the steel, aluminum tariffs you're seeing a lot of  companies really see that they're being impacted by this, they're going to  have to raise prices on a lot of products.  And the American consumer is  going to be the one that's going to have to pay for that.</p><p>We haven't even really felt the impact on the tariffs coming out of China  just yet, so what is timeline, what is the game plan here?  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, one of the important things for the consumer to know and for  the manufacturer to do is that the product is not available in the U.S.  either because of demand or because of the particular type.  They got to  get -- apply for and get these exemptions that allow them not to pay the  tariffs.  In the meantime, we have free trade partners such as Bahrain in  the gulf that are actually gearing up to supply us with aluminum.</p><p>And that will come in duty free if the negotiations go they're supposed --  way they're supposed to.  There is no question at all that if you are going  to have a trade war full employment this kind of period is the time to have  them but it's should also be short and it should lead to the kinds of  changes that I think are in long run good for the United States.  And  that's certainly what one Congressman is working toward.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Congressman, you say  that war leads to peace, war also creates casualties.  What do you say to  American farmers right now who are among the casualties that have been hit  by the trade battles that we've got with other countries?  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, first of all, casualty would mean you're dead and the  agricultural business United States is good, the President has talked about  and may -- and asked for the ability to provide some aid for specific  disruptions that might occur but so far, there is full -- there is full  sail of all the crops.  Again, remember when I -- when I campaigned as  private citizen for NAFTA, one of the things that was included under  President Clinton in the NAFTA reduction was in fact monies for market  disruption.</p><p>To help people that are disrupted.  There is no question at all that we  have a long history of exporting our manufacturing jobs in some cases to  countries that distort their markets such as China unwinding that has some  pain.  I think the important thing is we are still going to be the country  that a feeds the world, our farmers are going to in the long run do just  fine and if their short-term disruption, there are -- there are a number of  ways to fix it.</p><p>Some of it is in fact to take some of that tariff money and make it  available where farmers can specifically show that they've been adversely  impacted.  But let me just do one thing as an old economics student.  You  know, we continue for years to claim we were having gains and productivity  but the way the productivity calculation works is you take the total number  of people working total and the GDP and you say, here is how much more  efficient we are with less people.</p><p>But if you outsourced the source material, so you're only touching the  finished product.  You actually create a distortion.  So real productivity  is when Americans produce most efficiently as much as they can.  For  decades now, we've been taking copper, mining it in Nevada and exporting it  to China along with coal so they could smell it.  There's no logical reason  for an energy exporter and a mineral-rich country like the United States.</p><p>Not to make that valued added.  Meaning, that copper turns into wire, it  turns into products.  So getting back to having those kinds of industries  for all of us who leave off of it is critical.  You know, when I went to  college, they thought me there are only three things that create wealth in  America, mining, manufacturing and agriculture.  And those principles are  still true.  The rest of us make a living off of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I respect that, I got (INAUDIBLE) I went to college, they said  that trade wars were not a good idea.  And they said that sometimes it goes  recessions and depressions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ISSA:  You know, Neil, they're right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, no, no, no.  I'm just saying.  They're responding  tit-for- tat and tariffs on top of tariffs to somehow stabilize a world trading  environment that might be in your favor.  It sounds like you're just  playing with grenades here.</p><p>ISSA:  You know, there's no question at all that there is both risk and  reward.  You know, one of the challenges in any peace talk is you've got to  give the other side a pathway to a win on their side.  A pathway to  something where they can say this is fair.  In the case of the Europeans  for example on automobiles, it's pretty easy.  Drop their tariff with  United States to 2-1/2 percent or both of us drop it to zero. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But Congressman, we're not playing fair -- we're not playing fair.   We're making a big deal for example that comes to the Canadians.  20  percent tariffs that they impose on dairy goods.  Forgetting the fact that  that's about only area where they sort of abused the privilege.  When you  look at staff that come to us from the World Trade Organization on the  average fees imposed on goods and services on other countries, ours  averages at about five percent .</p><p>Canada about six percent.  So we're making a big deal out of milk and we're  getting cream no pun intended. </p><p>ISSA:  Neil, you're right about one thing, the solutions for free trade  restoration, full free trade restoration with Canada are easier than most  of the rest of the world. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But we want the Canadians with the Chinese, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  -- the focus here. </p><p>ISSA:  Neil, I've never lumped.  The Canadians where we have a good trading  partner with a few small changes or Mexico where in general we have a fair  trading partner -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ISSA:  But we have done that, Congressman.  We have done that.  What we are  doing now is we're already telling the Canadians we'll sooner deal and talk  to Mexico that are hammering out bilateral accord, our own little mini  separate NAFTA with the Mexicans, then Canadians have been our friends a  long, long time. </p><p>ISSA:  But both of these countries have increased their trade with us,  bilateral trade with us over the period of NAFTA.  And getting those  changes in place is the highest priority.  If I were looking at our trade  representative, there's no question at all.  The shortest path to real  solution is Canada and Mexico, I know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Congressman, you are a very successful businessman, you're the  richest Congressman.  So you didn't get that way just -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ISSA:  That's a low -- that's a low bar though, Neil, really. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, whatever.  You're no piker, right?  So my only point in  saying this is you know about business, you know how the business world  works, and something tells me you cannot remotely support this craziness. </p><p>ISSA:  Neil, I can support that small changes for example on my border with  Mexico, they allow raw sewage to pour into the Tijuana River in violation  of their agreement with us and they haven't been willing to upgrade just  their sewer systems so it doesn't pollute the beaches of San Diego.  Now,  that's not a lot to ask for in a Free Trade Agreement is that they honor  simple environmental things.</p><p>So there are -- there low-hanging fruit things that we can do with Mexico  to make this work.  It's important that we do it. Obviously, I want to get  to the peace talks as fast as possible with all of the countries that want  peace. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Congressman, you say that you campaigned for NAFTA as a  private businessman, the President says it was a terrible deal, terribly  negotiated.  Did you make a mistake getting behind NAFTA? </p><p>ISSA:  I think one unforeseen -- two unforeseen things, one that they  didn't live to up their environmental promises, that's a big deal.  The  second one is we didn't expect to have Chinese goods effectively  transshipped through Mexico.  If those two things can be fixed, I believe  the Trump administration can get to a deal with Mexico. </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Congressman Issa, it's always a pleasure.  So thank you  for taking the time.</p><p>ISSA:  Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Darrell Issa.  All right.  Home Depot could be a home run for the  markets.  Way behind Home Depot we'll explore and explain after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I notice there's a lot of music and it's great.  I think we should  go toward Gregorian chance myself or offer an idea, no?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  How about a German polka? </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  I would but it's at least something different.  It's nice.   All right, so couple hours from now -- mix of Gregorian chants I promise.   All right.  In the meantime, Home Depot first got the retail gate with  numbers that surprise on the upside.  Nicole Petallides on all the details  there.  And Nicole? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Neil.   I watched that on \"CAVUTO COAST-TO-COAST\" today.  So we are seeing futures  this morning to the upside to the tune of about 72 points.  This after  we've seen selling over the last several days.  Earnings have been pretty  stellar, 24.7 percent growth year-over-year when we expected just over 20  percent.</p><p>So they continue to be good and I guess some good news for you here this  morning on Home Depot and the Tapestry which is the parent of Coach, Kate  Spade, &amp; Stuart Weitzman.  Let's start off with Home Depot.  That's a Dow  component up 2-1/2 percent.  Same-store sales beat, raised the guidance,  profit soars.  And this is much like what we saw in the last quarter.  You  know, people were comparing Lowe's to Home Depot.</p><p>But it was Home Depot that really showed it could surpass all the estimates  in its own way.  And Lowe's didn't do exactly that, so there really was a  disparity between its big competitor.  Then let's get to Tapestry.  Of  course, we have the untimely death of Kate Spade herself in an apparent  suicide on June 5th.  And you know what happened, everybody sort of buying  the Kate Spade bags and it ended being that the Kate Spade sales were  better than expected.</p><p>They only dropped three percent.  And that's why you saw Kate Spade help  Tapestry overall.  And so that is the good news there.  And then big  picture what the traders are looking for, of course, they're keeping Turkey  in mind slower numbers for the week.  We're expecting obviously not as much  trading for the summer and we'll watch for U.S., straight talks and the  FOMC minutes next week.  Back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Nicole, thank you very, very much.  We're trying to  get some more details on this Italian bridge collapse that claimed at least  10 lives.  It could be many, many more here because we are told also from  the Italian Press many are still missing.  There are number of buildings,  homes, cars, trucks that were beneath that when all this happened.  We'll  keep you posted on that and more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  More on that bridge collapse in Italy.  Cheryl Casone  with that.  Hey, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, we're getting some more  pictures, more information, Neil.  A government source now tells an Italian  news agency the death toll now stands at 11 and we're getting this video  just in up the bridge.  This is what Italy's transport minister is calling  an enormous tragedy in Genoa, Italy.  This is the northern part of the  country where this happened.</p><p>You' looking at this new video that's just in.  It shows the moment though  that a 650-foot part of the Morandi Bridge fell crushing vehicles and some  structures below.  A firefighter reportedly says about 20 vehicles were  also involved in this disaster.  The bridge which was built in 1967  connects Italy to France.  The collapse happened just before a major  Italian holiday which is tomorrow.</p><p>I want to show you this picture of what the bridge looked like before the  collapse and then you can see on -- to right of your seen the devastation  after.  We continue to follow this story.  Will bring you all the latest  information as it becomes available to us in our newsroom here. </p><p>Well, another breaking news story out of London.  A man is under arrest  this morning for crashing his car in the security barriers outside the  British Parliament in London this morning.  He is described only as being  in his late 20s.  He is in custody on suspicion of terrorism.  No weapons  were found in the car.  Scotland guards says pedestrians and cyclist s were  hit.  A police do not believe any of the injuries are life-threatening. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEIL BASU, METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER:  Two people  have been taken to the hospital.  One man has already been discharged, and  one woman remains in the hospital being treated for series but thankfully  nonlife-threatening injuries.  Given that this appears to be a deliberate  act, the method and this being an iconic site we are treating it will as  terrorist incident.</p><p>And the investigation is being led by officers from the counter-terrorism  command. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, streets in the surrounding area still blocked off.  The  nearby Westminster Underground Station is still closed at this hour.  Again  coming up on rush hour in London, President Trump tweeted, short time ago  about it, another terrorist attack in London.  These animals are crazy and  must be dealt with through toughness and strength.  Those are the two big  stories we're following at Europe this morning, Neil.</p><p>The we're looking at this.  More of a global story.  Check out the price of  Bitcoin, trading sharply lower this morning just about 6,000 right now but  that's down 200 at one point.  Digital currency was below $6,000 for the  first time since June.  Nearly every other cryptocurrency is also under  pressure this morning.  Digital currencies last month on hopes that new  investors would be attracted to a Bitcoin-backed ETF but the SEC has  postponed a decision on the phone.</p><p>Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, many others talk a lot about Bitcoin and  getting into it but it's not 20,000 anymore, Neil. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Man, not for the faint of heart.  Thank you, Cheryl, very, very  much.  Jon, not remotely for the faint of heart. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  I've always felt that the technology behind Bitcoin,  blockchain technology is real and has a place in the financial system in  the future but the currency itself, I just -- I've never seen it, you know,  becoming a currency that people use, you know.  When people start shopping  on Amazon with Bitcoin, I believe it's real before until then I think the  price keeps going down. </p><p>BELL:  I mean it was -- it was 8,000 last month now we're back to 6,000. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where did it peak, around 19? </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I'm not sure. </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is surreal, surreal.  All right.  When we come back.  Tesla and  now reports that Elon Musk forget about all those reports you've heard  about on the Saudis, in the Saudis Sovereign Fund.  He's talking to Goldman  Sachs and a host of other hunt shows on that move to go private that now  has a lot of people screaming.  We'll explore after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Sometimes just when I'm waiting for music, they surprise me.  Now  Neil, we're not going to use that (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>Welcome, everybody, good to have you.  I'm Neil Cavuto in for my friend,  Maria Bartiromo, who's on vacation.  The lira is rebounding today, right  now, and that has provided an (INAUDIBLE) after the markets here and toward  relief that President Erdogan buys another day to stave off those who have  been saying, enough already.  Well, today is enough.  In our Futures  markets, in Europe, and Asia, largely advances across the board.  Now, keep  in mind, Japan is sort of the tricky wicket in all of this, because of its  exposure to this very country.  We'll get into that in a bit.  </p><p>Meanwhile, what did the Saudis promise, and when did they promise it, and  did potentially Elon Musk overstate the case?  With us now is Stefanie  Miller, a Height Capital Markets Senior Analyst on this whole back-and- forth as Tesla moves to go private.  I wonder what he said that would  trigger regulator's attention in this country just to put in perspective.   It started with the Saudis, as far as I know, Stefanie is saying, all  right, we can -- we can help you with this, right?  When does that cross  the line that we have to watch?</p><p>STEFANIE MILLER, SENIOR ANALYST, HEIGHT CAPITAL MARKETS:  I think it was  less about those conversations and more about the mechanism by which Musk  alerted his shareholders in the public, which was that very short tweet  last week, which, you know, there's news today it surprised the board  that's not -- that's not great news to be coming out if his confidants and  the folks who are seniors in the -- in the company weren't prepared or  didn't know that this was coming, that that's probably not a good sign.  I  think it's less about who this was and how these conversations sort of  unfolded privately, but there is a responsibility to shareholders about  when and how you announce, make announcements like this.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Stefanie, that tweet said that funding was secured.  Was that  a misleading statement?  It doesn't sound like the funding was secured, it  sound as like there was discussions between Musk and the Saudis, but that  they didn't necessarily commit to anything, they hadn't submitted  documentation or formal proposal.  Is that what the phrase that's going to  get potentially, him in trouble?</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, that seems concerning to me.  It's hard to know what  regulators will think in the end.  I feel as a -- as an analyst of these  tech regulator issues, I keep witnessing these first ever experiences that  we're going through.  It's a society where the technology is progressing so  rapidly but the parsing every word -- considering what every word means is  going to be types of things that are in a much greater scrutiny when Elon  Musk is breaking kind of boundaries by using Twitter to make an  announcement like this, and that does seem concerning.  And if that, if  saying that you've secured something that isn't secured, that does seem  very misleading, and --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Stefanie, by the way, we're getting word -- I don't want to  interrupt you there, but Stefanie is announcing -- Stefanie --Tesla is  announcing the formation of a special committee to look into this going  private thing.  But your thoughts on that?</p><p>MILLER:  That's great, I think.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I doesn't feel that way.  I just wanted to pass along.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, I think it's great.  I think any sort of -- anything  to bring some formality to this is going to be meaningful.  I think the  blog post was sort of a double-edged sword for that -- on one side, the  blog post yesterday to clarify, where Musk kind of laid out in much more  detail what he had hinted at last week.  It was great to get more  information, it also sort of makes me question, you know, did all that  information need to be given initially, what will regulators think that  there was a follow-on lengthy sort of explanation for what Mr. Musk was  thinking.  All of that sort of has good and bad notes to it.  </p><p>But you know, at the end of the day, Twitter is an approved medium for  companies to make announcements.  There is the idea that companies need to  have some precedent in how they've made announcements on Twitter in the  past, there's question around if Musk gets blocked people from following  him, does that sort of preclude certain shareholders potentially from  having access to that information?  And I think all of those are going to  be questions that SEC regulators are asking.</p><p>BELL:  Well, Stefanie, we just saw the tweet of, you know, it seems like  Tesla is working with some high-powered, you know, bankers: Goldman, Silver  Lake advising on this deal, some lawyers as well.  And this would be -- if  this actually occurs, it could be the largest leveraged buyout of all-time  at $70 billion.  This is a company that doesn't really generate a lot of  cash flow.  In blog post yesterday, Elon Musk alluded to the fact that he  was -- he's going to expect a lot of the equity players to hang around.  If  that is the case, the SEC is still going to have to review this company, it  will be under the watch of the SEC.  Do you think equity holders will be  able -- will want to -- excuse me -- stick around and hold this stock  through this process?</p><p>MILLER:  You know, this is an interesting company and how unconventional  its leader is.  And a lot of people have sort of invested in him as much as  in the company.  It's hard to imagine that that sort of sentiment and the  emotional attachment and sort of belief in what Elon Musk believes that  that would go away just because of the structure of whether it's publicly  or privately held.  So, I have to think the regulatory scrutiny is  obviously one thing, but there is a lot of evangelists out there, and it's  hard for me to imagine that that goes away.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Stefanie, Tesla burns through cash, it's got short sellers  coming after it, it's got a couple of bonds that are coming due, how  serious are its cash-flow problems, and is it talking about it going  private deal because it just basically needs to -- it needs more money?</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, I mean, there's a lot of reasons why Tesla may want to go  private.  One would be just to have access to it -- to much more capital to  help fund all of the ideas that its senior executive has.  Another would  just be to kind of come out from the scrutiny of being a publicly-held  company which comes with a lot of strings attached for someone who is so  creative.  So, it does seem like there are multiple -- there would be  multiple things that would make a buyout or a transition to a privately- held sort of entity very attractive for this specific company.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, Elon Musk has 20 percent stake in the company as it stands  now, right?</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  So, what would change if it's a private concern?</p><p>MILLER:  For him?  I don't think that he seem to change anything when it  went public.  I would -- I would -- it would be hard for me to imagine  anything about him, his commitment to the company, or his -- you know, his  vision for what the company means will change based off of the structure of  how the capital is held.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, the other point I had -- we were discussing during the break  is many of the attached -- maybe questionable attentions to his comments  last week about Saudi funding and all the rest, couldn't he just be, you  know, no unspoken thought, he has done this on analysts conference calls.   There has -- there's nothing sinister afoot here, obviously not a smart  thing to do, but as far as, you know, something Machiavellian or any of  that, I guess might be pushing it.</p><p>MILLER:  Agreed.  Yes, this seems -- I think that one thing that investors  in this company are pretty aware of, and a dozen of us who've been  observing it from the outside are aware of is that the intentions seemed to  be very, very good and pure, most of -- most of the time along the way even  when the decisions made maybe leave us scratching our heads because of how  unconventional or unconformist they are to how the rest of --</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right.</p><p>MILLER:  -- rest of it is done.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well put.  Stefanie, thank you very much.  Kat, I was thinking to  you and young people in general, the allure of electric cars, is it still  there?</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't know.  I don't really think so.  I don't have a car  whatsoever, I don't even know anyone with an electric car.  I mean, it's a  little more complicated.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But you again don't leave your apartment that much.</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't leave my apartment, and when I do, I do have a driver's  license, and I really, really shouldn't.  I haven't driven in about five  years.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's scary.  All right, that is very, very scary.  All right, in  the meantime, we should alert you to some primaries, at least four states  on Wisconsin -- I think this is the fourth attempt if you think about it,  that they're going after Scott Walker, or at least deciding on who his  Democratic challenger will be.  I go back to 2010 when he was elected.   2011 when he's breaking up unions, 2012 the special elections, 2014 is re- election.  Maybe this is the charm for them.  That is just one state, one  in yet in the Midwest.  Blake Burman live from the White House on what's at  stake.  Hey, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Neil, good morning to you.  Minnesota, Vermont, Connecticut, and Wisconsin  voters, if they haven't head to the polls, they're already this morning  will do so today for primary day.  Let me sort of tick through some of the  headlines in each of those states heading into this -- in today's election.   In Minnesota, for example, Congressman Ellison, he's on the ballot there,  but to become that state's attorney general, he has been accused in the  recent days of domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend which he denies.  </p><p>If Christine Hallquist wins her primary in Vermont, she would become the  country's first transgender gubernatorial candidate from a major political  party.  Republicans in Connecticut are eyeing the governor's mansion there,  they see a potential opening to take that seat.  But what really ties back  here to the White House is what you talked about in the lead-in, Wisconsin,  and a tweet from the President over the weekend threw a little bit of a  wrench for Scott Walker who's up in the primary today, but likely has his  eyes headed toward November, threw a wrench for walker other Republicans in  that state.  </p><p>Because over the weekend, the President sent out the following tweet as it  relates to Harley-Davidson saying, \"Many Harley-Davidson owners plan to  boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas.  Great!  Most other  companies are coming in our direction, including Harley competitors, a  really bad move.  U.S. will soon have a level-playing field or better.\"</p><p>Now, Harley as you know, it is based in Milwaukee, it has threatened to  move its manufacturing overseas.  European production overseas because of  President's trade policies.  Here was Walker's response to the President's  tweet, saying, \"As I said yesterday, I want Harley-Davidson to prosper here  in State of Wisconsin so, of course, I don't want a boycott of Harley- Davidson.  And one of the best ways for that to happen is to do what the  President has called for and that is to get no tariffs as soon as possible.   By the way, Neil, last night, the President did go to Twitter to endorse  walker, but this Harley-Davidson issue will not be going away any time  soon, as Democrats will most certainly try to use it against Republicans in  that state.  Neil?</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Blake Burman, thank you very, very much.  (INAUDIBLE)  you look at this back-and-forth and all these primaries, and they're going  to sort out who's ultimately going to be on the ballot in the fall.  When  you talk about -- so, what's the latest gauge they have on the November  election?  How things are looking for Republicans, for Democrats,  specifically governorships notwithstanding, it odds tonight, but more  control of the House and Senate?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, the question is whether the Democrats get  control of the House, and you know, on the one hand, they're very motivated  because -- they're very motivated to challenge the President.  On the other  hand, Republicans have a really strong economy behind them and it's kind of  hard to argue to kind of change the alignment of power right now when you  have a 3.9 percent unemployment rate and growth, depending on how you  measure around three percent.</p><p>TIMPF:  A lot of passing though, a lot of people on the left that maybe  didn't get out and vote in 2016 are going to get out there in '20 just  because of what happened in 2016. </p><p>CAVUTO:  And they've used these Ohio results, right, to say look, the guy  is just eking out -- (INAUDIBLE) it's barely hanging on, you know?</p><p>TIMPF:  I think there is a lot of passion on the Republican side, too, I  think it's higher now than it has been in the past before midterms I think  with one exception since 1994, Republican voter enthusiasm.  So President  Trump gets people really excited, whether it's for him or against him,  there's definitely a lot of passion involved.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Lindsey, if the House switch, became Democratic, market  reaction would be?</p><p>BELL:  It would still rally because -- again, because of certainty.  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Interesting.  So, the reality of that happening wouldn't dissuade  them.</p><p>TIMPF:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, wouldn't that lead to -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Impeachment (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  Always talk about impeachment and a new kind of  uncertainty.</p><p>BELL:  Well, in that case, when Clinton -- the impeachment (INAUDIBLE) the  star report came out and they were going through that, the market went down  but by the time it went through the Senate, it -- the market was back  towards --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That was one of the best times for the stock market in our  history, late 1990s.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  There are some differences here with this particular --  we'll see.  All right, Stuart Varney is coming up.  Why the tanking U.S.  economy is concerning.  Stuart Varney -- joking.  I'm joking.  More after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it is good to be Donald Trump if you want to pressure  Turkey, if you want to pressure the Chinese, or Canada, or Mexico, that we  are the strongest economy on earth and that will be the wind at our back  and get others to back down.  Stuart Varney weighs in on all of that.   Stuart, what do you think of that?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What are you doing, Neil?   Three hours, 6:00 to 9:00, another two hours, 12:00 to 2:00, and another  one hour, 4:00 to 5:00.  I'm trying to do the math even I know that's not  required for this program, but I think that looks to me like six hours of  broadcasting in a single day.  You know, they used to call me an air hog.   I think it's you, Neil.  But to answer your question, substantively --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you, Stuart Varney, very good having you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Answer my question.  OK, OK.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK.  OK.  We have very strong growth in America.  We have a very  strong economy.  And I think that is the leverage which President Trump is  using to go after our rivals on trade and foreign policy, and I think it's  working.  We've got news this morning that China, their investments in  public works, on machinery, that kind of thing is down to its lowest levels  since 1999.  They are slowing down.  Iran is in chaos because of our  threatened sanctions.  Turkey in chaos.  And maybe we'll get some progress  on the American pasta, but all around the block, we have a strong economy,  we are applying that pressure, which we can apply to our rivals, and I  think it's going to be a success.  We'll see.  What do you say, Neil?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think you're nuts.  I think you're risking destroying this  recovery by using it as leverage to do things that you of all people  (INAUDIBLE) you're one of the best educated people I know anywhere in this  business.  You went to Oxford, for god's sake.</p><p>VARNEY:  No, I did not.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I can't spell Oxford.  Now, you must know the risk and the lunacy  involved here.  Your thoughts.</p><p>VARNEY:  Risk and lunacy?  Can you show me evidence that our economy is  either falling apart or slowing down because of intended tariffs?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, no, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that you would risk --  no, no, no, I'm just saying by going -- fight tariffs with tariffs, and  more tariffs, the back-and-forth in a trade war, in all of this that that  is a very, very risky posture and could imperil this recovery.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I don't think it's that risky.  I think the president is  dealing some very strong hands --</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, you're pro-tariff.  Pro-tariff (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>VARNEY:  Don't put words in my mouth.  I did not say that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Pro-tariff, pro-tariff, pro-tariff.</p><p>VARNEY:  I trust President Trump to negotiate from a position of strength  and to come out with a good result.  Something wrong with that?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, so you're OK with doing something that in the  past has gotten us into severe recessions even depressions?  You're OK with  the sort of rolling dice on this country that you just recently crawled --</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't quite go all the way back to Smoot-Hawley 1932, but I can  go back --</p><p>CAVUTO:  You were there covering Smoot-Hawley, and I congratulate you for  that.  But could this be another Smoot-Hawley?</p><p>VARNEY:  No.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  Fine.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you think it is?  No, serious, do you think it is?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it could be, and I worry about it, and I think I have an  obligation to keep America safe.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Superman, can you see any damage evident in the economy now  that sees fit --</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's still early, it's still early.</p><p>VARNEY:  Wait a minute, we started down this road in February.  It is now  middle of August.  Show me some damage.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  So, you ignored the farmers, you ignore, by the way, Adam  Shapiro, who I think in your hour is going to get to a business that's been  directly affected by this metal stuff, but you choose to ignore that.</p><p>VARNEY:  No.  I ignore it only in the sense that I --</p><p>CAVUTO:  You ignore, ignore, ignore.</p><p>VARNEY:  Your over exaggerating it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VARNEY:  And I'm not.  There is minor leagues damage, minor leagues.  And  there's also some (INAUDIBLE) coming down the pike.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, tell that to the soybean farmers, tell that to the wheat  farmer.  I'm in touch with the folks, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I'm not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm done.  I am done.  I cannot wait.  I know you'll justify it.   You're an American.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm in touch with America, despite the voice.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Mr. Oxford smarty pants.</p><p>VARNEY:  I didn't go to Oxford.  I wouldn't caught dead in Oxford.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.</p><p>VARNEY:  I went to the Plebeian London School of Economics.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Same thing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Thank you very, very much, Stuart Varney, and just  nine minutes until that wisdom.  In the meantime, speaking of wisdom, you  see this algae problem they've got in Florida, but it's expanding a lot.   Jeff Flock on more on that.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Stuart and Neil, man  against man.  This is man against nature.  Neil, incredible pictures from  Florida, disgusting, we're not talking about red tide.  We're talking about  red tide and green tide here.  We've got a shot from the air that gives you  an incredible picture of what Florida is being enveloped by right now.   Standby we'll have the full story.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Jon had to remind me how this song matches this story.  These  cookie kids who joined me here.  Anyway, Jeff Flock is north of Fort Myers,  Florida on the -- its spreading algae problem.</p><p>FLOCK:  I tell you, Neil, I've seen some disasters in my life but this one  is different.  You know, algae is not anything incredible and that it  happens, but the way it's happening in Florida right now is just -- nothing  like they've ever seen before.  We've got a drone from the air that gives  you this canal.  We're talking about two tides here.  It's a red tide and a  green tide.  You're looking at the green tide right now.  This is algae  bloom which comes largely from runoff agricultural runoff, and I don't  know, if you come back to me here, this is what this looks like, it has  just exploded.  Look at this, that's the water in Florida right now.  Can  you see that?  That is incredible.</p><p>In addition, what's even worse than this as bad as this looks like -- wow,  I wish I hadn't splashed that on myself -- we have the red tide, that is  actually out in the gulf.  This is in the -- in the freshwater.  The red  tide is in the saltwater, that also comes roughly every year, but this  year, it lasted for 10 months.  It usually lasts about two months.  Toxic  stuff in the water that kills the marine life and then the air is also  polluted with stuff that if you got any kind of respiratory problems, you  got problems too.  It is decimating tourism, people who live here have to  leave their houses, and just look at this, Neil, I mean, people say this is  just algae bloom, a lot of people that live here say that is what it looks  like, which I'm not going to say what it is -- what they think it is, but  it's brown and it smells terrible.  If we had smellivision here, people  would change the channel.  That's what I'm telling you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Hey, hopefully, everyone's had breakfast.</p><p>FLOCK:  Enjoy your breakfast.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Thank you very, very much.  Those are drones  apparently, not mosquitoes.  I was a little worried.  Stick around.  We'll  have more of this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, some quick and final thoughts from my colleagues.  Kat?</p><p>TIMPF:  I'm just really excited to eat some breakfast.  That's pretty much  it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, there you go.  All right, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I just wanted to say, Maria, it was a pleasure working with  you today.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Finally, Lindsey.</p><p>BELL:  Well, I was just going to say that this retail rally I think is on  it with Home Depot and Tapestry, the numbers are really good this morning.   We've got some other big names coming out later in the week.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  There you go.  Now, we go to Stuart Varney who's in  touch with the pulse of the American people.  Stuart?</p><p>VARNEY:  Sarcasm is a low form of wit.  Good morning, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Good morning, my friend.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

By the end of the week, a group of American executives and investors found an alternate tech universe. It resembles Silicon Valley superficially. Look closer, and it becomes a futuristic yet closed-off world that can be equally impressive, alienating and dystopian.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chinese technology executives, they found, were even more driven and more willing to do whatever it takes to win. But that comes with major trade-offs, and punishing work schedules are only the beginning. They found Chinese tech executives to be less reflective about the social impact and potential misuse of their technologies, a potentially worrisome quality in a country with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">loosely enforced privacy laws</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">strict government censorship</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">a powerful domestic surveillance apparatus</url>.</p><p>\u201cIt was impressive to see the pace of innovation in China,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Mark Goldberg</url>, a partner at Index Ventures, a venture capital firm. \u201cSome of the newer technologies, like facial recognition software, can be very powerful, and will need to be deployed thoughtfully \u2014 not just in China, but also in the West.\u201d</p><p>In August, Mr. Chan, Mr. Goldberg and 11 other Silicon Valley investors and start-up founders took a trip to Beijing and Shenzhen, two cities that are competing for the title of the Silicon Valley of China. Organized by the venture capital firms Basis Set Ventures, Index Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank, it was intended to help them understand how China has become a tech rival to the United States in barely two decades.</p><p>Silicon Valley once saw China as a copycat, but it now has some of the world\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">biggest and most powerful internet companies</url>. It       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">has more unicorns</url>, or privately held companies with valuations of over $1 billion, than the United States. The China offices of venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital now manage bigger funds than their American headquarters. Silicon Valley luminaries like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Michael Moritz</url> of Sequoia Capital have been urging American entrepreneurs and investors to learn from China\u2019s work ethic, ambition and technological advances.</p><p>The Americans got upfront lessons on how quickly China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">embraced mobile phones</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">electronic payments</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">video streaming</url>, and how intensely it has pursued artificial intelligence.</p><p>\u201cI live in San Francisco, but I find it helpful to visit the other parallel universe from time to time,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Lan Xuezhao</url>, founding partner of Basis Set Ventures, who was born in China and visits the country every year. \u201cTo some degree, it\u2019s like looking into the future.\u201d</p><p>It started the moment the group members entered their rooms at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Beijing\u2019s central business district, where a notice listed some of the websites they would be unable to call up \u201cdue to Chinese internet regulations\u201d: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google, Bloomberg and The New York Times.</p><p>Online payments represented another telling metaphor. Mobile payments are almost ubiquitous in the biggest Chinese cities, but setting up an account requires a local mobile number and a Chinese bank account.</p><p>One afternoon they were desperate for caffeine and spotted a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Luckin Coffee</url> outlet, an up-and-coming Chinese brand, in the canteen of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Bytedance</url>, the A.I. information and entertainment powerhouse. But Luckin takes orders only on its mobile app. At the cashier-less convenience store at the headquarters of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">JD.com</url>, the online retailer, an employee paid for their snacks with his own phone.</p><p>\u201cChina\u2019s internet is a walled garden,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cNo one can break in unless you\u2019re from here.\u201d</p><p>Within that walled garden, everything seemed to be moving at an extraordinary speed. While Silicon Valley start-ups raise funding every 18 to 24 months on average, the group was told that the most successful Chinese companies do it every six months. It isn\u2019t unusual for a hot start-up to raise funding three to four times a year.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I go to the U.S., I feel that I\u2019ll need to grow 10 times faster,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Alexander Weidauer</url>, a founder of the Berlin-based A.I. chatbot developer Rasa and the only member of the group not from Silicon Valley. \u201cNow I feel I\u2019ll need to grow 100 times faster. The pace in China is crazy.\u201d</p><p>Their hosts kept reminding them of the advantages China had over the United States in A.I. development. China\u2019s vast population and loose privacy laws give them access to much more data. A.I. companies also have considerable government support and are willing to pay more for top talent.</p><p>\u201cThe U.S. competitive edge over China may not be long,\u201d Kai-Fu Lee, chief executive of Sinovation Ventures and former head of Google China, told them. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cthe Americans now have the information disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>But it was also obvious to the group what China was missing. For starters, everybody is Chinese. Even in its early days, Google had employees from 39 nationalities speaking 40-plus languages.</p><p>\u201cChina is a bit homogeneous,\u201d said Mr. Chan, an early Google employee. \u201cYou don\u2019t find as much the perspectives of the world here compared to Silicon Valley.\u201d</p><p>Then there are the work schedules. The Silicon Valley natives were introduced to the Chinese start-up concept of 996: Work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Once they got over their shock, they had to ask: Does that punishing schedule make sense?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried so much about my portfolio companies not working as hard as the Chinese companies,\u201d said Mr. Chan, now a partner at Felicis Ventures. \u201cI\u2019ll worry when they\u2019re less creative and less efficient.\u201d</p><p>While China is becoming more innovative, many members of the group said they believed \u2014 and some of their Chinese counterparts agreed \u2014 that the United States still led in some areas.</p><p>Although some Chinese tech companies can look very Silicon Valley-esque \u2014 with sprawling campuses that include dining halls, gyms and nap rooms \u2014 their preferred management style is still top down and results driven. Unlike Silicon Valley, smart underlings have less freedom to start something new.</p><p>Underscoring their admiration for strong leaders, the Chinese technology figures told the Silicon Valley group that many in China idolized the Uber founder Travis Kalanick, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">resigned as chief executive</url> last year after the company was embroiled in various scandals. The reason:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">In his battles with a bigger local rival</url>, Mr. Kalanick could be as aggressive and scrappy as a Chinese boss.</p><p>There was very little discussion about the consequences of Chinese companies\u2019 ruthless focus on growth and the social impact of the technologies they develop \u2014 criticism <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">Silicon Valley now faces</url>. The visitors asked how Chinese companies dealt with the issues of censorship and algorithm-driven social media, but their hosts either seemed puzzled by the questions or brushed them off.</p><p>Technology itself is neutral, some of the Chinese executives said. It depends on how people use it \u2014 an argument that Silicon Valley companies used to make.</p><p>And then there was the surveillance. Chinese companies have little choice but to cooperate with Beijing\u2019s growing efforts to track the daily lives of its own people. Some, in fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.felicis.com/team/wesley-chan/\">make money off it</url>.</p><p>Still, the Silicon Valley delegation did not expect facial recognition technology to be so widespread in Chinese life. Companies they visited used it at office entrances and at retail kiosks inside their facilities. They also saw demo videos of how the Chinese police could use the technology to monitor potential crimes in crowded public spaces and learn how many suspects had been arrested.</p><p>After grasping how prevalent the cameras were, they started counting them. Even the van they rented from the hotel in Shenzhen had a handful of cameras installed, blinking from time to time to signal that they were on.</p><p>Then, like many people in China, they got used to it, as if the cameras weren\u2019t even there.</p><p>PHOTOS: WESLEY CHAN, an early Google employee; LAN XUEZHAO, founding partner of Basis Set Ventures (B1); American executives and investors were shocked by the Chinese concept of 996: work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.

Those on the Right are of differing minds as to how best respond to decisions made by tech companies and online publishers in an effort to accommodate advertisers or maintain privately adopted community standards, standards which read as outright ideological discrimination to many.</p><p>Republicans and conservatives point to instances of genuinely biased political decisions on the part of media companies, political commentators, and tech companies, and see the need to assert their right to public discourse. Some call for a sort of \"fairness doctrine\" to govern social mediain essence treating online forums as a public utility. Others wish to hold social media companies financially liable for what people post on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Those who object to tech companies' enforcement of community standards point out that they are vague and therefore inconsistently applied. What's worse, the \"purge\" of unsavory internet personalities might not stop with neo-Nazis and Klan members. Shrill internet activists have been known to incite communities to report certain accounts en masse, hoping that website moderators will do the dirty work and suspend or de-verify accounts from prominent commentators with differing ideologies.</p><p>Americans prize their First Amendment rights, which among other things guarantee citizens' right to free speech, association, and exercise of religion against government interference. At first glance, viewpoint discrimination and online censorship on public forums looks like an open-and-shut case of censorshipanti-American, bad for civic education, and fundamentally unfair. However, right-of-center folks also rightly note that companies like YouTube, Google, and Patreon are privately held entities that are also entitled to First Amendment rights, including the right not to associate with certain people or viewpoints. Those inclined to keep government small, also fear that any move to bring balance to online forums will instead empower the government to exert its own form of censorship.</p><p>These important considerations enjoy robust debate at the Capital Research Center. In the interest of furthering constructive debate and modeling civil discourse, CRC decided to host an online symposium on the issues of tech censorship and hear differing views on how best to combine concerns about free expression with concerns about free association. We hope you enjoy these considerations.</p><p>Big Tech and the Threat of Unperson-ing, Ashley Rae Goldenberg</p><p>Facebook Phobia: Social Media's Bias is Profits Not Politics, Ken Braun</p><p>De-platforming, The Power Of Left-Wing Media, And Their Right-Wing Allies, Joseph (Jake) Klien</p><p>Be Careful of Rush for Tech Regulation, Michael Watson</p><p>The articles and the opinions therein are the work of individual authors and do not reflect institutional views on the part of the Capital Research Center.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123046488</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGR-9C31-DYTH-G1KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Have you wondered why social media sites show ads for something you recently purchased on an unrelated website? Are you concerned that your son or daughter might be getting addicted to an app or a game on their phone?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Internet generates legitimate concerns about privacy, safety, fairness and misinformation. It's good we are having a national discussion about how best to address such concerns. But when someone suggests we need a law to solve our problems, it's time to pause and take a breath. And take another breath - or maybe book a meditation retreat - if someone claims we need a whole new federal bureaucracy.</p><p>But that's exactly what some have done. Scholars at the University of Chicago's Stigler Center recently called for the creation of a new federal Digital Authority to oversee everything from privacy and mergers to discrimination and online addiction. Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) have a similar proposal for a 1,600-employee U.S. Digital Privacy Agency, which would regulate the way tech companies handle data. President Barack Obama's chief economic adviser Jason Furman wrote for the U.K. competition authority a report suggesting a new digital regulator might be needed. Australia's competition regulator recently recommended something similar.</p><p>On its face, a single expert agency, laser-focused on one set of problems, sounds sensible. But history shows that such industry-specific agencies are most susceptible to \"regulatory capture,\" a term used to describe when an institution is dominated by the industry they are charged with overseeing - for example, when a state board that sets the rules for the practice of dentistry is dominated by practicing dentists.</p><p>The idea was popularized by the Stigler Center's namesake, Nobel economist George Stigler, who argued that \"regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.\" In his foundational paper \"The Theory of Economic Regulation,\" Stigler warned that any regulated industry has strong incentives to form close connections with its regulators to seek favors. The inevitable result, he argues, is that industries disproportionately influence the agency's agenda, shape its rulemaking and even supply it with personnel.</p><p>Companies find it much easier to influence narrowly focused institutions than institutions with broader law enforcement mandates. Where the latter hear from a wide range of companies with a variety of concerns, the former hear only from one type of company. Think about how much easier it is to talk your way out of a speeding ticket from the local police officer, who knows your family, than it is to deal with an effectively anonymous city cop who pulls over dozens of drivers a day. Similarly, big companies would much rather deal with a select group of bureaucrats whom they know well - and who hear only their perspective most of the time.</p><p>Captured agencies don't hold companies accountable; instead, they act to benefit the industry's established players, disadvantaging newer firms and the public at large. In worst-case scenarios, such agencies can block new, disruptive competitors that threaten the established, regulated industry.</p><p>The recent report from the Stigler Center holds up the Federal Communications Commission as an example of what a new Digital Authority could look like. But the FCC is a perfect example of the likely problems of an industry-specific regulator. At nearly every turn, with every new potentially disruptive communications innovation, the FCC (and its predecessor, the Federal Radio Commission) did the bidding of the best-connected incumbents. As former FCC chairman Michael Powell said, \"[T]he history of the FCC is, when something happens that it doesn't understand, kill it. We tried to kill cable. We tried to kill long-distance. When [MCI founder] Bill McGowan start[ed] stringing out microwave towers that threatened AT&amp;T, the FCC tried to stop him. The FCC tried to kill cable because it was going to threaten broadcasting.\" While it didn't halt technological progress or competition, it often slowed it, occasionally by decades.</p><p>For example, almost immediately after its creation, the Federal Radio Commission sided with industry players when it rejected the expansion of AM radio bands at the behest of existing commercial broadcasters. Later, the agency slowed the development of FM radio to protect AM radio manufacturers. It cracked down on early \"community antenna television\" (cable TV) to protect the broadcast television industry; conducted \"beauty contests\" to parcel out valuable broadcast licenses, sometimes to the politically connected (such as President Lyndon Johnson's wife); and slowed approvals and imposed onerous regulations on satellite radio services to protect traditional radio stations. The FCC also transfers billions of consumer dollars between various telecommunication competitors in pursuit of several different connectivity goals - an exercise that brings everyone to Washington to petition the FCC for a share of the money.</p><p>Thinking forward, the FCC's history suggests that a single digital regulator would make it easier for existing companies to lobby for processes that restrict new competitors. Even regulations that are intended to promote competition could easily become barriers to new competitors. Similarly, new digital business models could be delayed or blocked by regulators who are too familiar with the existing way of doing things to imagine new pathways to success.</p><p>Then there's the question of price controls: Fixing prices with competitors is anticompetitive - unless the government is the one setting the prices. And where private price-fixing agreements are unstable (since it only takes one defecting party to ruin the agreement), government-mandated prices are conveniently government-enforced. A single digital regulator could provide a simple mechanism for guaranteed profits. Imagine a digital ad industry regulated like the FCC regulated the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly for more than 40 years.</p><p>So what is the alternative? As I noted earlier, regulators are less susceptible to the interests of individual companies and interests when they hear from a lot of different companies with a lot of different interests. Thus, generalist agencies that broadly regulate many industries are more resistant to capture. Further, agencies that primarily enforce laws (like the DOJ) are far less attractive targets for regulatory capture than those that mostly write rules (like the FCC). A company that manages to get in bed with the former might be able to dodge a lawsuit or put pressure on a competitor, but that pales before the possibility of influencing rules that reshape a company's entire industry.</p><p>In the United States, we already have an economywide enforcement agency: the Federal Trade Commission. Charged by Congress to promote competition and to protect consumers, the FTC has decades of experience addressing antitrust and consumer protection issues in the tech industry. Even now, it is pursuing investigations into digital companies under its current authority. And if new capabilities are needed to police digital companies, doesn't it make sense to give such authority to an experienced agency that has been resistant to regulatory capture?</p><p>Like many Americans, I am concerned about today's Internet-related challenges. But I hope our representatives will take a breath and focus on using and improving the tools we already have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-97e1d051b89f4b9fa2d1ccfe68a11720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCV-WJ61-DXKP-J54N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1264\"/><timeReceived>10:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Executives were amazed at how well their workers performed remotely, even while juggling childcare and the distractions of home. Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc., among others, quickly said they would embrace remote work long term. Some companies even vowed to give up their physical office spaces entirely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, as the work-from-home (WFH) experiment stretches on, some cracks are starting. Companies begin to think that remote work is not so great after all. Projects take longer, collaboration is harder, and training and integrating new employees is more complicated.</p><p>And I would like to share with you the negative side of remote work. There may be no richer creative hub story than this:</p><p>It was 2004, Mark Zuckerberg's summer of craziness. At 20, he and five buddies had rented a Palo Alto home, where they partied and wrote code for Facebook. One day, as Zuckerberg and the guys were strolling the neighborhood, he saw a familiar face. It was Sean Parker, the cofounder of Napster, the music sharing service. By coincidence, Parker, at loose ends and contemplating his next move, was staying at his girlfriend's parents' house, just up the street from the Facebook pad. The very next week, the big-thinking, smooth-talking Parker moved in with Zuckerberg and began introducing him around Silicon Valley. By the end of the summer, he had paved the way to Facebook's first big investment-$500,000 from Peter Thiel.</p><p>Thiel met 23-year-old Ukrainian immigrant named Max Levchin a few years earlier. After a bit of chatting, Thiel asked why the young man was in town. 'Probably gonna start a company,' Levchin said. 'Oh, great,' Thiel replied, and suggested the two meet up the next day and talk more over smoothies. And the consequence?</p><p>In 2002, eBay paid $1.5 billion for the resulting start-up-PayPal, making the two men and several partners rich. Over the subsequent years, PayPal vets including Thiel, Elon Musk, and Reid Hoffman went on to found YouTube, Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, Yelp, and Palantir.</p><p>Perhaps no phenomenon is more studied, marveled, and desired in the world of high tech and science than the mystery of serendipity. My Oxford Dictionary explains serendipity as, 'The faculty of making happy and unexpected discoveries by accident.'</p><p>But now Silicon Valley seems to be under a little-noticed threat. Amid Covid-19, the deep recession, and renewed antitrust pressure from Congress and regulators, the Valley faces a very different challenge-the disruption of its very essence, the serendipitous encounter. The culprit is a rush by many of the Valley's leading companies to permanently lock in the coronavirus-led shift to remote work.</p><p>If engineers, designers, and venture capitalists are geographically disbanding, working via the cloud instead of walking Google's halls, surfacing at Buck's Restaurant, or the cafes on University Avenue, how will future serendipity happen?</p><p>If the founders, engineers, and designers in such startups are laboring entirely or largely from their own homes, and miss their moment, doesn't Big Tech potentially lose its next big growth engine?</p><p>Entrepreneurs say that, at least currently, the answer is yes-the WFH mandate has probably put classic serendipity out of reach for Silicon Valley's budding companies, and for companies in other tech centers/start-up villages.</p><p>No one knows exactly what such a new system might look like. If a demise of serendipity leads to Silicon Valley's decline, the world is unlikely to get an equal substitute. We may simply lose our engine of technological advancement.</p><p>If the past is instructive, the pandemic will pass and many daily routines will return. Hordes of people will return to the office, but large numbers won't. Some will pick up and move. At that point, today's effort to digitalize serendipity will pick up more urgency. Videoconferencing and other software will get better, and some companies will claim their product fosters the unscripted moment in truly innovative ways, blind to demographics.</p><p>The message I am trying to get across with these examples is that in the Philippines we need to culture serendipity in our creative enclaves in Cebu, Makati, Pasig, Quezon City, Iloilo, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, and a few more. We will have to find a smart balance between people working from home and people to 'bump' into each other to discuss 'crazy' ideas and developments. And we need to save the start-up ecosystem.</p><p>However, while we protect and preserve the opportunities for social interaction, being the key to group creativity and innovation, we wish to see government to find the right balance between public health and economic and social health.</p><p>Let me have your views on this;

Google, Facebook and Microsoft are among the big tech giants to have already signed up, among 150+ other firms, although names notably missing at this point include Amazon and Apple.</p><p>So what are the principles? Governments are tasked with ensuring that all citizens can connect to the internet, and that all of the internet must be available to them, all of the time. In other words, every individual must be able to get online, and there should be no censorship.</p><p>Any interference in terms of what can be accessed on the internet should &amp;#x201C;only [be] done in ways consistent with human rights law&amp;#x201D;, the contract notes.</p><p>Those are some big goals, of course, and policies that clearly won&amp;#x2019;t go down well in some corners of the world.</p><p>In terms of making sure every citizen across the globe has an internet connection, the contract lays out a guideline of access to broadband being available to at least 90% of citizens by 2030.

A further point is to support independent research on how interface designs affect the process of getting consent from users (as well as other considerations) and how these could &amp;#x201C;influence privacy outcomes&amp;#x201D;.

The natural cynical assumption might be that this won&amp;#x2019;t realistically happen, at least not as it&amp;#x2019;s laid down in black-and-white here.</p><p>However, if the companies who have signed up to the contract can&amp;#x2019;t show that they are indeed implementing the principles, and working to move forward with them, they may face being booted out from the group of organizations backing the plan.

Hasta que hace un par de semanas, la rivalidad entre ambos sectores volvi\u00f3 a tomar relevancia. Y ayer estall\u00f3.</p><p><br/>En el centro del debate est\u00e1 la necesidad de regular o no a las compa\u00f1\u00edas tecnol\u00f3gicas que trabajan en el sistema financiero. Seg\u00fan argumentan los bancos, las fintech no tienen las mismas obligaciones impositivas ni normativas que la banca tradicional.<br/>As\u00ed, la semana pasada el presidente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Bancos Argentinos (Adeba), Javier Bolzico, se refiri\u00f3 en un discurso a las \"asimetr\u00edas\" y anunci\u00f3 que hab\u00eda presentado \"una propuesta pol\u00edtica\" para \"nivelar la cancha\" entre todos los jugadores.<br/>Adeba se bas\u00f3 en un informe redactado a su pedido por la consultora FIEL, que pon\u00eda el ojo m\u00e1s bien en el rol dentro del sistema local del gigante Mercado Libre, al que identific\u00f3 como Big Tech, categor\u00eda que comparte con las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas multinacionales como Google, Amazon, Facebook y Apple.<br/>La respuesta de las fintech no se demor\u00f3. Ayer, la entidad empresaria que nuclea a m\u00e1s de 160 compa\u00f1\u00edas del sector, emiti\u00f3 un duro comunicado en respuesta. \"Desde la C\u00e1mara Argentina de Fintech nos parece oportuno reiterar, como venimos haciendo desde nuestra fundaci\u00f3n en octubre de 2017, que s\u00f3lo a trav\u00e9s de la colaboraci\u00f3n con el sistema financiero tradicional podremos encarar los desaf\u00edos de inclusi\u00f3n financiera con los que nos interpela la realidad argentina actual\", puntualizaron.<br/>Juan Pablo Bruzzo, presidente de la asociaci\u00f3n, lo explic\u00f3 a\u00a0El Cronista:\u00a0\"Nos pareci\u00f3 importante sentar una posici\u00f3n para aclarar varios puntos que toma el comunicado de Adeba, que se prestan a confusi\u00f3n\".<br/>El tambi\u00e9n CEO de la fintech de pago Moni dijo: \"Adeba habla las fintech como si fuera un s\u00f3lo gran jugador, cuando es un colectivo que incluye muchos verticales (pagos y transferencias, financiamiento colectivo, pr\u00e9stamos, servicios fintech B2B, insurtech, inversiones, seguridad inform\u00e1tica y blockchain y criptomonedas). Algunos est\u00e1n regulados, como el caso de las insurtech por la SuperIntendencia de Seguros o los brokers, por la CNV. Otros, que trabajan en lo que est\u00e1 m\u00e1s ligado al negocio bancario tradicional, no lo est\u00e1n por el Banco Central porque no hacen lo que se llama intermediaci\u00f3n financiera. Pero s\u00ed, se ajustan a las normas que el regulador le impone al sistema\".<br/>Mientras el tono de la discusi\u00f3n aumenta, el Banco Central afirm\u00f3 que \"No har\u00e1 comentarios sobre este tema por el momento\".<br/>El debate se traslad\u00f3 a las redes sociales. Mientras el comunicado de la C\u00e1mara era distrbuido, el VP ejecutivo de Mercado Pago y mano derecha de Marcos Galper\u00edn, Osvaldo Gimenez, eligi\u00f3 responderle a Adeba con el hashtag: \"No lo hizo un banco\" en su cuenta de Twiter. \"Hace d\u00e9cadas que la inclusi\u00f3n financiera en Argentina es baj\u00edsima. Es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil excusarse en la falta de regulaci\u00f3n, que innovar y competir\", escribi\u00f3. \"Innovamos creando un QR interoperable, se lo ofrecimos gratis a los comercios y en 12 meses ya hubo m\u00e1s de 8 millones de pagos desde celulares\".<br/>En conversaci\u00f3n con este diario, Gimenez destac\u00f3 que los productos de su compa\u00f1\u00eda \"est\u00e1n incluyendo financieramente a millones de personas\" y que estos desarrollos surgieron \"sin la necesidad de ning\u00fan arbitraje regulatorio como dan a entender los bancos\".<br/>Gimenez afirm\u00f3 que muchas de sus iniciativas, como los pagos QR, apuntan a reemplazar el efectivo, no a desterrar a los bancos. \"Lo que pas\u00f3 fue que la competencia hizo que bajen los precios. En la Argentina, antes de que lancemos nuestros POS M\u00f3viles, estos se alquilaban y el alquiler costaba entre u$s 20 y u$s 30 por mes. Esto hac\u00eda que el parque total de terminales de pagos sea de alrededor de 800.000; mientras que nosotros, desde que salimos, ya vendimos m\u00e1s de 900.000 POS. El secreto es que lo vendemos por debajo del costo y sin alquiler mensual\".<br/>\"Hay que competir, y habr\u00e1 que hacerlo con m\u00e1rgenes que ser\u00e1n cada vez menores, pero es importante hacerlo para aumentar la proporci\u00f3n de personas que acceden a los sistemas financieros\", dijo G\u00edmenez.<br/>La pregunta es si el fuego cruzado entre ambos bandos quebrar\u00e1 los espacios de di\u00e1logo que los reguladores hab\u00edan generado, como la Mesa de Innovaci\u00f3n Fintech a cargo del BCRA. Tanto en el Central como en la C\u00e1mara Fintech aseguraron que el espacio de trabajo conjunto se mantendr\u00e1 sin cambios.<br/>\u00a0<br/>M\u00e1s impuestos para la inclusi\u00f3n financiera<br/>Hay un punto en que tanto el Banco Central, como los bancos privados y las fintech est\u00e1n de acuerdo: menos de la mitad de la poblaci\u00f3n argentina posee acceso al mercado de cr\u00e9dito. Y consideran que es clave hacer crecer el \u00edndice de inclusi\u00f3n financiera.<br/>Esta es, seg\u00fan una definici\u00f3n de la OCDE, la promoci\u00f3n de un acceso alcanzable a una amplia gana de servicios financieros y la ampliaci\u00f3n de su uso hacia todos los sectores de la sociedad.<br/>La torta de los no bancarizados o subbancarizados es el negocio que puede hacer crecer al sistema financiero local y a su vez, ampliar el nivel de formalidad de la poblaci\u00f3n, clave para aliviar la fuerte presi\u00f3n impositiva.<br/>Justamente, el tratamiento impositivo es uno de los puntos en los que los bancos reclaman la \"desigualdad de condiciones\".<br/>Un viejo reclamo que se actualiz\u00f3 cuando en las \u00faltimas semanas se cre\u00f3 la Ley de Econom\u00eda del Conocimiento, que le da ventajas tributarias a empresas que generen \"empleo de valor agregado\". La queja de las entidades \"tradicionales\" en este aspecto es que \"no puede d\u00e1rsele el mismo incentivo impositivo a una startup que reci\u00e9n est\u00e1 comenzando, que a una empresa tecnol\u00f3gica gigante\".<br/>El sector fintech responde que sus compa\u00f1\u00edas, diversas en sus modelos de negocios, cumplen con los reg\u00edmenes impositivos. Pero que, adem\u00e1s, incluir a m\u00e1s cantidad de personas al mundo de los pagos, contribuye a incrementar la formalidad de la econom\u00eda.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECC-7315980</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCG-BV51-F03R-W1MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"981\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 \u00a9 El Cronista, Buenos Aires, Argentina Derechos reservados</copyright><publicationName>El Cronista Comercial</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>18 junio 2019 martes</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Peri\u00f3dico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Finanzas y mercados</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008WVM</classCode><className>Banking Institutions + Systems</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>Central Banks</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N522000CC</classCode><className>Banking, Lending + Credit Services</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000943</classCode><className>Interest Rates</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N522110DC</classCode><className>Commercial Banking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIyQTAxOUNERDI4NDdFNjkyMEFDOTFFM0MwMTQzNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI</classCode><className>Commercial Banks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N523110EC</classCode><className>Investment Banking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

We know that and we're used to it. We also know the images won't be analysed unless there's been a crime - so that's OK, isn't it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No it's not. Because, as The Mail on Sunday reveals today, a number of police forces and councils have recently adopted a controversial new form of camera technology which is not accurate, reliable or trustworthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the heart of this development is something called live facial recognition (LFR), software which can automatically recognise a face in a crowd within a fraction of a second. And this means we can be monitored everywhere we go, no matter who we are with or what we are doing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facial recognition could strike at the very core of our free society. Yet - without any public consultation - British police forces are introducing LFR as quickly as they can. It's as if we're standing in a perpetual identity parade without ever being told, let alone asked.</p><p>Needless to say, the dangers are huge and I have witnessed them first-hand. The South Wales police force has been testing facial recognition for a couple of years and, at the invitation of the Chief Constable, I attended a trial at last year's Swansea air show.</p><p>What I saw was concerning, and not just because I object to the slippery introduction of Orwellian surveillance. For when I saw the technology up close, I could also see how fallible it is.</p><p>Hidden some distance away, I watched as individuals at the air show walked past an LFR camera and the computer studied each face, taking just 0.2 seconds per individual. In that time, it generated a 'face print' and compared it with mugshots of known criminals.</p><p>I witnessed how the computer flagged what the policeman beside me described as a 'wrong 'un' and how the individual's face then flashed up alongside the corresponding criminal face.</p><p>Ten seconds later, however, and after human intervention, it was decided it wasn't a match after all. The human eye had picked up minor differences in the hairlines of the men in the two photographs - a very necessary check.</p><p>Yet, with the rapid pace of technological advancement, it seems to me inevitable human beings will eventually be removed from the process altogether. And what then?</p><p>An investigation by the Big Brother Watch think-tank has shown LFR results are worryingly inaccurate with the computer correct, at best, in only five per cent of cases. Accuracy fell to two per cent in a trial at the Notting Hill carnival.

In that time, it gener\u00ad ated a 'face print' and compared it with mugshots of known criminals.</p><p>I witnessed how the computer flagged what the policeman beside me described as a 'wrong 'un' and how the individual's face then flashed up alongside the corre\u00ad sponding criminal face.</p><p>Ten seconds later, however, and after human intervention, it was decided it wasn't a match after all. The human eye had picked up minor differences in the hairlines of the men in the two photographs - a very necessary check.</p><p>Yet, with the rapid pace of tech\u00ad nological advancement, it seems to me inevitable human beings will eventually be removed from the process altogether. And what then? An investigation by the Big Brother Watch think-\u00adtank has shown LFR results are worryingly inaccurate with the computer cor\u00ad rect, at best, in only five per cent of cases. Accuracy fell to two per cent in a trial at the Notting Hill carni\u00ad val. It seems that LFR has particu\u00ad lar trouble when it comes to people who have darker shades of skin.</p><p>More favourable results emerged from an Essex University review of the Metropolitan Police trials, in which the computer was found to have been accurate in 18 per cent of the individuals it 'recog\u00ad nised'. This is still an astonishingly low figure, however.</p><p>Why, then, is the Met announcing the 'successful' completion of its trials? And why is it installing LFR across the capital? The police should look to America, where the tech\u00ad nology is already taking hold, to see how misguided a decision this is.</p><p>When the American Civil Liber\u00ad ties Union (ACLU) ran photographs of members of Congress through US police software, the computer identified 28 of them as criminals. Wrongly, of course. And the people it picked out were mostly from African and Latino backgrounds.</p><p>A computer scientist at the Massa\u00ad chusetts Institute of Technology, Joy Buolamwini, experimented with the most commonly used facial recognition systems to find out how good they were at match\u00ad ing a photograph to a face stored in a memory bank. The worst results were for women with dark skin. IBM's system, for example, failed 31 per cent of the time.</p><p>Ms Buolamwini, who is Ghanaian-\u00ad American, began the research after discovering that LFR couldn't even locate her face - let alone identify her features - unless she wore a white mask. LFR is biased both in terms of race and gender.</p><p>Then we must ask about the cost to our liberty, and the troubling example set by China, where the Communist leadership uses LFR to great effect. When citizens buy a smartphone, they are photographed for use with LFR, which means they can be tracked by the ubiqui\u00ad tous surveillance cameras. It is used much like our number\u00ad plate recognition software, and the result is that you can get an auto\u00ad matic fine for antisocial behaviour. It has been used to publicly shame people who go outside in their pyjamas. And, bizarrely, public lavatories are being fitted with LFR to set a limit on the amount of toilet paper that those in need can take.</p><p>The omnipresent technology is used in Xinjiang province as an aid to repress the Uighur Muslim population. The computer keeps records of their comings and goings and can be connected to other apps that alert police if more than five Uighurs collect together. Many end up in re-\u00adeducation camps.</p><p>China is close to becoming the ultimate surveillance state, but Russia is at it too, with LFR applied to the vast Moscow CCTV network.</p><p>It is all too easy to assume that, because we are a democracy, such intensive surveillance would not be tolerated in Britain. But we have seen how quickly civil liberties can be ignored in the case of, say, major terror attacks. In the past few weeks, in fact, Sir Andrew Parker, head of MI5, spoke of the 'need' for our intelligence services 'to be able to make sense of the data lives of thousands of people in as near to real time as we can get to'.</p><p>The Mail on Sunday's revelation gives me grave cause for concern because it means that to ID people not already on the police offenders' lists requires records of the faces of all of us. And where do those come from? Enter the private companies who are always ready to help with large data banks of facial portraits and accompanying technology.</p><p>We know that big tech companies such as Facebook retain photo\u00ad graphs of us, but even small start\u00ad ups are getting in on the act.</p><p>For example, the firm Clearview has scraped the images of more than three billion faces from internet sites and is selling these along with its technology to law-\u00adenforcement agencies and other companies.</p><p>It's too early to tell what injustices this may bring in the future, but we can be confident there is a breathtaking arrogance to it all.</p><p>It emerged last year, for example, that a number of private shopping centres including Sheffield's Mead\u00ad owhall, the Trafford Centre in Man\u00ad chester and the area around London's King's Cross had been trying out LFR without telling any of us.</p><p>They were mainly looking for shoplifters or antisocial behaviour. But if a shopkeeper felt someone had behaved suspiciously, they could put that individual's picture on a watch list that was shared with all of the other shops.</p><p>The suspect had no idea they were on the list and no recourse to justice. That is plain wrong.</p><p>As Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham put it recently, LFR is a 'step change in policing techniques; never before have we seen technologies with the potential for such widespread invasiveness'.</p><p>When it comes to LFR, we are in the Wild West. There is sparse regulation and what we do have is ignored with impunity. It won't be easy to put this genie back in the bottle but we must try - and try again until we succeed.</p><p>Our Government must immedi\u00ad ately limit the scope of LFR to serious offences. We need strong laws to ensure that this horrific technology is contained.</p><p>This horrific technology must be containedby strong laws</p><p>The computer's only accurate in five per cent of cases</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMALS-157105757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMALS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y44-8N11-DYTY-C00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1252\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

Rockefeller's Standard Oil and Andrew Carnegie's U.S. Steel, among others.</p><p>The widely recognized face of market domination, that of financier J.P. Morgan, was to become the mustachioed model for the board game Monopoly, which capitalized on public outrage over lax antitrust enforcement that contributed to the stock market bubble in the 1920s, and ultimately to the Great Depression. (Monopoly was a later version of The Landlord's Game, created by Lizzie Magie in 1903 to promulgate the theories of the populist economist Henry George.)</p><p>It's now been about 40 years since a second economic revolution began, and like their 19th century industrial predecessors, a handful of dominant technology companies find themselves in the cross hairs of regulators for an array of alleged monopolistic offenses.</p><p>Assertions that some tech companies have become too powerful emanate from both sides of the political aisle and address concerns ranging from political bias to privacy to housing prices in San Francisco. Chris Hughes, the co-founder of Facebook, has gone so far as to suggest that the only way to fix the company's privacy and political interference problems is to break it up.</p><p>Sentiment to dismantle Big Tech is unfolding against a backdrop of trade weaponization by the Trump administration, which views high-end technology in a national security context. The administration recently banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, a powerful Chinese tech company competing with American firms on a 5G rollout; the Chinese government responded to the Huawei blacklisting by threatening that American companies that comply with the ban could be denied access to Chinese markets as well.</p><p>The triple-whammy of tariffs, security (personal and national) and monopolistic concerns  has added to volatility in the stock prices of tech's biggest names. For several weeks after the Trump administration raised the ante on Chinese tariffs in early May, each of the so-called FAANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet - had underperformed the overall equity market, with Facebook, Netflix and Google sustaining near-double digit declines.</p><p>Shifting interpretations</p><p>During more than a century of often inconsistent moves to tame monopoly power, there have been two main reasons for the U.S. government to bring antitrust cases: harm to the consumer and impediment to free market competition. Amazon and Google each have been unofficially charged with the latter, which is where the issue wades into the political weeds.</p><p>Google was accused by the Trump administration of hiding conservative thought on its popular search engine; Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, which keeps a running tab on the president's false or misleading statements.</p><p>Political vendettas aside, there are questions about the applicability of using government regulation to protect smaller competitors. In recent decades, antitrust actions have focused on consumer welfare, rather than on market hegemony. In other words, if concentrated corporate power didn't harm consumers, it was probably OK, and maybe even good.</p><p>Using consumer welfare as the sole standard, it could be difficult to make a broad case against Big Tech. Google's search engine and Facebook's platform are free, and Amazon's retail operation exerts relentless downward pressure on consumer prices.</p><p>Cases could still be brought, however, on privacy grounds, particularly against Facebook.</p><p>At a minimum, the recent volatility in tech stocks implies that regulatory scrutiny is here to stay. Still, history informs us that antitrust actions, like those brought against IBM in 1969, AT&amp;T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998, can linger in legal limbo for years or even decades.</p><p>For investors, that might suggest there's still time to pass Go, even if they don't collect the full $200.</p><p>Tom Saler is an author and freelance journalist in Madison.

Here is part of the articles. The FBI's active shooter data \u2014 which categorizes incidents based on the nature of the attack, not the number of casualties \u2014 differs from studies that define mass shootings in other ways, from three killed, four killed, or four or more shot and injured or killed.[9] Gun law skeptics like John R. Lott, Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center[10], say the FBI's active shooter data are flawed and disputes that incidents have increased. </p><p>But even he agreed the number of people killed in these mass shootings has gone up dramatically. According to the latest FBI figures, there were 884 total fatalities from 2000-2018. The deaths averaged about 28 a year from 2000 through 2009 and nearly 62 a year from 2010 through 2018. . . .Lott's Crime Prevention Research Center[11] charted mass public shootings of four or more killed since 1998. That data shows a fairly consistent handful a year over that period, though the number of fatalities has risen sharply. . . .Stanford University law professor and gun policy expert John Donohue III said the FBI's compilation of active shooter incidents is about the best data available today tracking the type of public mass shooting incidents that have gripped the nation this summer. . . . <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PBS-News-Hour.png\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PBS-News-Hour.png</url>PBS News Hour, August 6, 2019 I mean, look, at the end of the day, all gun violence is terrible. We're looking at this thing that keeps happening over and over again.[12] According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, 94 percent of these active shooter, active gun, and mass shootings take place in gun-free zones. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newsweek-Banner.pngNewsweek\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newsweek-Banner.pngNewsweek</url>, August 7, 2019 This madness might be amusing were it not for the way public attitudes are being shaped by inaccurate reporting.[13] The United States is not, for example, the world leader in mass shooters\u2014as The New York Times and other news outlets have falsely reported based on a study that the Crime Prevention Research Center[14] has shown to be badly flawed. Likewise, the repetition of the phrase 'mass shootings' instead of 'mass murder' keeps the focus on gun control and the Democrats rather than the sickness inside the two alleged killers. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American-Greatness-Banner.png\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American-Greatness-Banner.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NewsMax-Banner.pngAmerican\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NewsMax-Banner.pngAmerican</url> Greatness, August 9, 2019, NewsMax[15], August 12, 2019 President Obama's assertion on Monday that 'No nation on earth comes near' the proportions of the mass violence problem of the United States is false.[16] The Crime Prevention Research Center has made an exhaustive study of the incidence of mass killings, following the FBI definition excluding incidents that kill fewer than four people and gang fights over turf, or incidences of authentic guerrilla war. By these standards, covering from 1998 to 2015, and 53 attacks and 57 shooters within the United States and 2,354 attacks and over 4,800 shooters in the rest of the world, the U.S. accounts for 1.49 percent of the world's killings, 2.2 percent of the attacks, and 1.15 percent of the public shooters, although the United States has 4.6 percent of the world's total population. Out of the 97 countries rated, the United States ranked 64th in attacks and 65th in fatalities. And the other countries compared were not the world's 96 least organized and civilized national jurisdictions. Norway, Finland, Switzerland, and France, the first three very high standard of living countries, all have at least 25 percent more mass killings per capita than the United States. The other 96 countries as a group, including relatively very nonviolent countries such as Canada, Australia, and Singapore, have had a rate of increase in mass killings that is 291 percent higher than that of the United States. . . . The gun-free zone theory has been a total failure. Ninety-eight percent of American mass public shootings have occurred in places where guns are banned, apart from in the hands of police. The Democrats' customary solution is to federalize gun laws and impose restrictions. We might expect that this would generalize the results of heavily gun-regulated areas such as the open firing ranges of large virtual no-go areas in Chicago, Washington D.C., and the recently celebrated Baltimore. The new gun regulations in New Zealand following the recent Christchurch mosque shootings, which left 51 people dead, have resulted in almost total noncompliance. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Review.pngNational\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Review.pngNational</url> Review, August 11, 2019 John Fund as this note: Take proposed new background checks. 'There is not one mass public shooting this century that would have been stopped had background checks on the private transfer of guns been in effect,' says John Lott,[17] who heads the Crime Prevention Research Center and is the author of the book The War on Guns[18]. The existing background-check system frequently fails to approve guns for many people with a legitimate fear or a need for them for protection, Lott noted in an op-ed for the New York Times in 2018. Virtually all of the initial denials in gun purchases are mistakes, he observed. Expanding the existing flawed background system would open the door to set up a national registration system for guns. Our Canadian neighbors to the north had an expensive and unworkable gun registry that they eventually shut down in 2012. As for 'red flag' statutes that are ostensibly designed to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, the existing ones certainly aren't crafted that way. Only one of the 17 states that currently have such laws even mentions the term 'mental illness' in the statute. States that already have Baker Act statutes (which allow the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual) along with existing red-flag laws don't even involve mental-health-care experts in deciding what to do with people whose gun applications are denied. How strange that the existing laws remove the normal role of mental-health-care professionals from the process. It's as if a silent agenda that has little to real concern for safety is at work here. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Washington-Examiner-Banner.pngWashington\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Washington-Examiner-Banner.pngWashington</url> Examiner, August 13, 2019 For example, a 1997 study by University of Chicago economist John Lott assessed county-level data from 1977 to 1992 to examine the relationship between concealed carry laws and violent crime.[19] The study found that states with unrestricted concealed carry laws experienced 8.5% fewer murders and 5% fewer rapes than states with restrictive concealed carry laws. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ricochet-Banner.pngRicochet\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ricochet-Banner.pngRicochet</url>, August 12 2019 Emminent Law Professor Richard Epstein notes: It is also possible that the increase of legal guns in the United States has provided, as economist John Lott argued[20] in More Guns, Less Crime[21], an additional layer of protection. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NewsMax-Banner.pngNewsMax\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NewsMax-Banner.pngNewsMax</url>, August 13, 2019 'Mass shootings don't happen in other countries.'[22] Wrong. They do, and America ranks well down the list.[23] The Crime Prevention Research Center analyzed the frequency of mass shootings, comparing the U.S. to European nations and Canada. America ranked twelfth. The CPRC also determined that of the 86 countries where mass shootings were identified, the U.S. ranked 56th in per capita rate of attacks, and 61st in mass public shooting rate. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Texas-Score-Card.pngTexas\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Texas-Score-Card.pngTexas</url> Scorecard, August 9, 2019But background checks may not be the answer, according to Dr. John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center[24]. In an op-ed published in The New York Times last year[25], Lott wrote that '[t]he background check system confuses the names of law-abiding individuals with those of criminals, resulting in thousands of 'false positives' every year.' Lott also points out that from 2006 to 2010, there were over 370,000 denials of gun purchases from background checks. Of those, federal authorities only prosecuted 460 of them, with only 209 leading to convictions, and the number of prosecutions from state authorities was few. 'Why didn't more of those denials lead to perjury prosecutions?' asks Lott. 'According to my analysis, the reason is simple: A high percentage of cases are dropped because the applicant was wrongly denied clearance to buy a gun.' Such facts lead one to question whether or not more background checks\u2014or any harsher gun control measures on law-abiding citizens\u2014is the appropriate response to these tragedies; moreover, whether elected officials should be so quick to embrace such measures comes into question, given the emotionally driven response to curtail civil and other constitutional protections. . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dailywire-News-Banner.pngThe\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dailywire-News-Banner.pngThe</url> Daily Wire, August 11, 2019 On Saturday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) published[26] her plan[27] to combat gun violence on blogging site Medium.The Daily Wire reported[28] on the plan, noting that several of the measures being proposed by the presidential hopeful are rather controversial. Given the nature of the plan, we reached out to Dr. John R. Lott, economist and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC), whose research in the field of gun violence is nearly unparalleled. Here's what he had to say about Warren's article. First, as a prelude to her gun control pitch, the senator from Massachusetts claims that once the auto industry began introducing features like seatbelts, airbags, etc, deaths related to car accidents dropped precipitously. 'Over fifty years, we reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths. And we're still at it,' Warren writes. Lott thinks this logic is misleading, and that it's important to understand why in the context of possible gun regulations: It is pretty deceptive to claim that government regulations reduced motor vehicle deaths by 80%. Those deaths were falling much faster before the federal started regulating auto safety. As indicated by the figures from my book, 'The War on Guns': 1) it is easy to see that cars were getting safer from the time the very first data was released in 1921, long before there were mandated federal safety regulations, and 2) when you look over the entire period, the rate at which car safety improved actually slowed down after the federal government started regulating car safety. The first seatbelts were introduced in 1950 by car companies that were figuring out on their own how to make cars safer. But the New York Times' graph doesn't show the even faster drop in vehicle deaths per-mile-traveled that occurred before 1946. It is important to note that accidental deaths from all sources are falling over time. Companies are competing against each other to provide customers with safer products, and items such as seat belts, shatter proof glass, padded dashboards, and safety cages were just some of the many safety features adopted by car makers long before the federal government got involved in regulating auto safety. Government regulations slowed down safety regulations for a simple reason: the government micromanaged how companies would meet those safety improvements. It isn't just that the government mandated that car companies had to use airbags in their cars, it is that the government would tell the companies exactly how to make those bags and how to install them. That forced car companies to wait on installing these safety features until the federal government told the companies exactly how they wanted the product made and installed. If the companies didn't wait, they may find themselves spending hundreds of millions of dollars, or even billions of dollars, only to find that they had to redesign everything and start all over. . . . More of the long piece that they had is available here[29].      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Washington-Free-Beacon-Banner.pngWashington\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Washington-Free-Beacon-Banner.pngWashington</url> Free Beacon, August 20, 2019 'We identified two qualifying studies that estimated the effects of assault weapon bans on different violent crime outcomes[30],' the review said[31]. 'One found uncertain effects of such bans on total homicide rates (Lott, 2010); the other found a suggestive effect consistent with assault weapon bans decreasing firearm homicides (Gius, 2014). Considering the relative strengths of these studies, available evidence is inconclusive for the effect of assault weapon bans on total homicides and firearm homicides.' . . The experience of just two states, however, may not generalize. A research review[32]from the Rockefeller Institute of Government found there were 'not enough [red flag] laws and not enough changes over time to generate stable effect estimates.' Another review[33], published by John Lott and Carlisle E. Moody in the Social Science Research Network, found that red flag laws have 'no significant effect on murder, suicide, the number of people killed in mass public shootings, robbery, aggravated assault, or burglary.' Additionally, critics of the laws have expressed concerns that the evidentiary standard used for red flag laws may be too low. Initial confiscation requires only 'reasonable suspicion.' Lott has claimed[34] 'when hearings occur weeks or a month later, about a third of these initial orders are overturned, but the actual error rate is undoubtedly much higher. These laws make no provisions to cover legal costs, and many people facing these charges do not retain counsel.' In other words, at least some individuals are being wrongfully deprived of their constitutional rights and face a steep path to redress. . . .      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Epoch-Times-Banner.pngEpoch\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Epoch-Times-Banner.pngEpoch</url> Times, August 7, 2019 Gun expert John Lott told The Epoch Times that the red flag federal proposal is a dangerous mistake for Republicans.[35] 'Everyone wants to stop mass shooting, but let's do something that'll work. Red flag laws will cause more problems than they'll solve,' Lott said. 'I know a woman whose husband was murdered in front of her. She was being stalked, and her husband was killed by her stalker.

'Police officers are frequently depressed because of horrors they see on the job.

Yet, the myth remains alive and is sure to be regurgitated endlessly again. The following video from John Stossel explains how the myth got started and why it's bogus: Many on the left have tried to delegitimize CPRC's research. Snopes rated their claim as 'mixed' but CPRC debunked their assessment here[47]. Glenn Kessler, the fact-checker at The Washington Post, also suggests that CPRC's research is misleading[48] for including acts terrorism, which, he suggests, inflates the number of mass shooters abroad, however, if we excluded acts of terrorism from mass shootings, the El Paso shooting would not count as a mass shooting, as it is now being investigated as domestic terrorism[49]. The Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting[50], and the Las Vegas shooting[51] were also considered domestic terrorism incidents.

'He was informed he had lost his appeal, but Twitter officials still gave no reason for blocking his account.

They don't even have to be living in the state. There is no hearing. All the judge has before him is the statement of concern.' Red flag laws have nothing to do with mental health. Only one of the 17 states now imposing red flag laws on their citizens even uses the term. Wrote Massie and Lott: 'It's about figuring out who is going to commit a crime (or suicide). This is the realm of science fiction.' It's also the theme of Steven Spielberg's 2002 film Minority Report wherein three 'precogs' predict the future criminal behaviors of suspects. As viewers will remember, it did not end well. The Fourth Amendment requirement demanding 'probable cause' has been almost completely ignored. As Massie and Lott noted, 'Little certainty is needed. Initial confiscations often require just a 'reasonable suspicion' which is little more than a guess or a hunch.' In addition, red flag laws typically make no provisions to cover the legal costs incurred by the victim (not suspect) and so many charged will not be able to have an attorney assist them. Finally, wrote Massie and Lott, 'It has always been possible to take away someone's guns but all 50 states have required testimony by a mental-health expert before a judge. Under red flag laws, however, expert testimony will no longer be used.' In addition, 'Gun-control advocates argue that it's essential not even to alert the person that his guns may be taken away. Hence, the 5 A.M. police raids.' Red flag laws don't work. That's the conclusion Lott came to in a study he and a professor at the College of William and Mary published last December. After reviewing data from 1970 through 2017, they concluded that 'Red flag laws had no significant effect on murder, suicide, the number of people killed in mass public shootings, robbery, aggravated assault, or burglary. These laws apparently do not save lives.' . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Times-News-West-Point-Georgia-Banner.pngThe\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Times-News-West-Point-Georgia-Banner.pngThe</url> Times-News (West Point, Georgia), August 6, 2019 By using FBI data and criteria related to mass public shootings, the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) shows that 90 percent of mass public shootings between 1998 and June 2019 occurred in GFZs.[78] I have been engaged in many debates, differences of opinion, and courtroom battles.

He said that a Twitter representative concluded that the only possible explanation was that someone 'reported' the CPRC tweet, but that no one reported the other accounts' tweets.

Lott, who describes himself as a conservative, is a leading gun crime and statistics expert, and the offending tweet had to do with the true ideology espoused by the New Zealand mosque shooter. In the March tweet, Lott said that the killer, contrary to popular belief, is a socialist and environmentalist who hates capitalism. And this can be deduced from the shooter's manifesto. When asked why they decided to block the CPRC account, Twitter said they do not allow linking to content 'that includes excerpts of manifestos of mass shooters' - and this is 'due to the safety of Twitter users and regulations abroad.' . . .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ammoland-logo.pngAmmoland\">https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ammoland-logo.pngAmmoland</url>, August 15, 2019 This article is an updated version of the article published in January of 2017.

Lott surveyed the research and found that 'since 2011 firearms research in medical journals has increased more than five-fold, as former New York City Mayor and multi-billionaire Michael Bloomberg has poured untold tens of millions of dollars into the effort.'[94] . . . 'I have been an academic for most of my life and can't fathom how one could legitimately spend that much money on the small studies that mostly just crunch government-gathered data,' says Lott. 'But no one seems to worry whether this federal research money\u2014money taken from the pockets of American taxpayers\u2014is being wasted or used for a blatant political purpose.' All this gun-research money from the government (as well as from wealthy people such as Bloomberg and from many left-leaning foundations) is going overwhelmingly to public-health researchers who have a bias against our right to bear arms. 'These researchers cherry-pick research to focus on particular states in particular years. If 20 states have passed a law, why look at just one?' Lott asked rhetorically. 'Obviously, to find the result that best supports the preconceived advocacy agenda of researchers.' Some of the examples of this data-mining the CRPC found included a claim that a Connecticut gun-licensing law caused a 40-percent drop in the state's homicide rate when the homicide rates fell nationally by 32 percent at the same time. 'If the period of study had been one year longer or one year shorter, the national drop would have been much larger,' said Lott. In another example, to exaggerate risks that households with guns face, the CRPC found that researchers lumped gang fights involving 'children' 18 and 19 years of age into data on guns in peoples' homes. In an attempt to treat gun ownership like a disease\u2014and therefore to ban or further restrict access to guns\u2014this research misses what actually causes the violence. 'Over 50 percent of murders occur in just 2 percent of the counties and even in those counties it is mainly in very small areas of about 10 blocks,' says Lott. 'Obviously, the problem causing a great deal of violence is drug gangs. If you are going to solve the problem you have to reduce the profits those gangs get from selling drugs.' . . .

'I see a major cyberattack in our digital world in the next three years. It's at that time our [banking] industry will wake up to see the significance of what cyber security is,' he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Considered to be a pioneer of mobile banking, Hussain also predicted that Pakistani commercial banks would not come up with anything of significance in the digital space and their customers would force them to open up their systems to APIs [application programing interface] of fintechs. He followed up with one more prediction: these banks will end up buying fintechs as opposed to creating them.</p><p>When it comes to digital banking, Hussain has a knack for seeing the future well in advance. But, are his predictions just plain obvious or alternatively more like a shot in the dark? To find out the rationale behind his predictions, Profit caught up with him later and expanded the discussion further.</p><p>Pakistan's first Unicorn will be a fintech platform play?</p><p>The highest possible chance Pakistan can create a Unicorn will be a fintech platform play, Hussain said. 'We don't have that kind of power in any single app. We may have got an app valued at $100 million or $150 million, but a billion dollar is a big number,' he said explaining why he thinks the country's first Unicorn will be a fintech company.</p><p>Explaining, Citibank's former country head said that a fintech platform, which can develop multiple solutions like those offered by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group will have a real chance of potentially becoming a Unicorn.</p><p>Alibaba Group is the holding company of Ant Financial, the world's largest fintech company valued at $60 billion that equals four Deutsche banks. Yes, you read that right. Fintechs are typically standalone Internet-based financial services companies that compete with traditional banks in a marketplace. Over the past decade, they have changed the way banking and financial transactions are done thus increasingly getting high valuations by investors.</p><p>'The top five valued companies of America in 2016 were the Googles, the Apples and the Amazons, they are no longer the Exxons, the Fords and the General Motors,' Chris Skinner said explaining how technology has changed things in the last 20 years he is one of the top 40 most influential people in financial technology and a leading expert on information security.Has Pakistan the potential to produce a fintech?</p><p>'Something is changing. The digital platform revolution that we are seeing today\u2026 the integrated open marketplaces, which connect people who have money with those who need money, just as Uber does with cars,' Skinner said in his presentation in the digital banking summit.</p><p>The industrial model of high valuation businesses, which require physical manufacturing of products, has changed and tech companies are frequently becoming high-valued entities, the expert said, backing it with examples, particularly from fintechs.</p><p>Paypal, valued at $48 billion in October 2016, may be the oldest and most established fintech company in America, but it doesn't stop new fintech startups from gaining traction. It is evident from Paypal's new competitor Stripe, which saw its valuation increased from $5 billion in 2015 to $9 billion a year later.</p><p>'Stripe is an API for doing merchants accounts online that's really easy to use. It is expanding rapidly across Asia, which is why its valuation almost doubled in a year,' he added.</p><p>Cutting-edge fintech companies and financial innovation are changing the competitive landscape, and are redrawing the lines of the financial services industry, says Global Fintech Report 2017 by PricewaterhouseCoopers. This growing market segment has already produced many Unicorns, a clear indication fintechs are on a roll. But, has Pakistan got the potential to produce one?</p><p>Can do, says Hussain</p><p>'You have to be cognizant that it can be done,' Hussain said adding as one builds up a billion-dollar business, he should be clear on how much money he is prepared to spend and risks he is willing to take. 'If you do that you are on the right track.'</p><p>Nadeem Hussain himself has invested in startups to exploit the areas that he predicts will soon become relevant. But, are his predictions a case of crying wolf to generate business for his startups or he is actually putting his money where his mouth is?</p><p>There are currently 27 fintech companies in Pakistan, out of which seven belong to Planet N Group, which is 90 percent-owned by Hussain, His holding company is in the process of launching Publishex. This upcoming startup has integration with Telenor, Zong and Jazz and will offer nano payments based on credit balance on customer's SIM as opposed to his mobile account.</p><p>'They [banks] haven't created any model that looks at the long tail customers, which is typically what the fintechs look at. That is, small ticket items with high value,' Hussain said and he seems to be doing exactly that. Publishex's integration with top three telecom operators would mean a target market of 122 million SIMs, their combined user base as of May.</p><p>However, Hussain's Planet N is not the only contender for first movers' advantage in the fintech race. Financial Ninja (Finja) is another interesting fintech startup to watch out for.</p><p>'We wish to digitalize the money. What Whats App has done to messaging, we want to do to payments in Pakistan,' Finja's Founder and CEO Qasif Shahid told Profit in an interview. His company, in partnership with Finca Microfinance Bank, is developing a digital payments platform SimSim.</p><p>Digitalizing money, making Pakistan cash-light</p><p>Shahid aspires to make Pakistan a cash-light economy in the next three to four years and he chose to do it with 'free payments' through SimSim. 'Our value to the microfinance bank is that through this opportunity the bank has to grow exponentially that has never happened before for a microfinance bank,' he said.</p><p>Giving background of his statement, the CEO said microfinance banks have failed the world because their business model is analog. For example, he said Professor Muhammad Yunus made this model 40 years ago in Bangladesh but this model had only 300 million global customers during this time. By contrast, cellular companies gained five billion in 20 years. 'That type of growth is very elusive for a microfinance bank on its own,' Shahid said referring to the latter.</p><p>Right now, Finja has 20,000 users and a few hundred merchants on its platform but it believes if e-commerce remains free, there is a real chance that 100 million people will reinvent their relationship with money in three to four years that's the market it aims to tap into.</p><p>The numbers for fintechs may look small at the moment but Hussain thinks it will take one to three years for these companies to fully evolve and provide full range of services in payments, savings, credit, wealth management, and information the five areas of fintech that people grow in globally.</p><p>Standalone fintechs have been a major business threat to financial services sector, but one can't write off cellular operators when it comes to digital payments. According to the PwC study, telcos and big tech companies are seen as potentially large disruptors to the banking sector because they are able to innovate at a far faster pace than incumbents.</p><p>'Telcos can play a big part in the digital revolution from a fintech prospective,' Hussain said. They will end up giving voice for free because data is going to drive the fintech play, he said. They have a large customer base (140 million), they need to translate this data through machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to create solutions for their customers' financial need, he added.</p><p>Telcos have long been dominating the digital payments scene in the country. The country's first mobile payments platform EasyPaisa of Telenor Bank alone accounts for 70 percent of the market. It claims to have processed five per cent of Pakistan's GDP in 2016 at more than 1 million transactions a day the country's official GDP was $300 billion as measured in May, 2017.</p><p>'We are aiming to digitize almost 100,000 merchants by 2020,' President and CEO Telenor Bank Ali Riaz Chaudhry told Profit currently there are only 35,000 merchants that accept debit or credit cards.</p><p>Powered by a total retail merchant universe of nearly two million, Pakistan's retail payments market is estimated to be more than $150 billion this is nearly 10 percent more than Hungary's entire economic output of 2014.</p><p>By contrast, the digital payment penetration remains much smaller at $150 million or mere 0.1 percent that is almost all retail transactions are done in cash.</p><p>Bullish on the future of fintechs</p><p>Hussain may have the most bullish take on future of fintechs, but he doesn't seem too optimistic about commercial banks' understanding of threats facing digital banking.</p><p>The Planet N's founder says Pakistani banks don't think they are vulnerable and they are not even bothering about information security. 'Not a single [Pakistani] financial institution or telco was using their services,' Hussain said, referring to Pakistan-based information security companies that are developing solutions for clients all over the world but not contacted by local financial institutions.</p><p>These banks are using technology that just feels comfortable, the banker said. They may have their own systems but the fact that these banks are complacent makes them vulnerable, he said. 'Banks think the safeguards they have in place are adequate,' he added implying it may not be a good idea.</p><p>When Hussain was running Tameer Microfinance Bank's EasyPaisa service, the bank was hacked. As a result, it had to bring its system down, and spend a lot of money to fix it. 'We had a high-powered telco as a partner with sophisticated firewalls and hacking pulse, but we still got hacked,' Hussain said he refused to reveal the details though. If a sophisticated player can get hacked, other places, which have weak cyber security protocols, are certainly vulnerable, he said.</p><p>'I think only an attack, and hopefully I am wrong, will shake us up to get us to the right level of cyber security,' Hussain said. And his statement doesn't come without a basis. The banker relates his observation to the experience he had at a commercial bank where he had seen, firsthand, sophistication of cyber hacking the recent developments in online security tell a similar story.</p><p>According to a post by information security research firm, SecurityIntelligence, there has been a fundamental shift in the manner online crimes are taking place and they are happening at a scale not seen before. These crimes are committed by groups of people who use increasingly sophisticated techniques and collaborate with each other to target financial institutions.</p><p>'There is a real chance that a bank will fall in 2017 as attacks get more advanced and the hackers get further inside the network,' said Aden Davies, Director of Portfolio Management at 11FS, a top-notch fintech consultancy company based out of United Kingdom. 'The challenges faced by SWIFT in 2016 show that critical infrastructure is at risk and it only takes a handful of weaknesses to be exploited for major damage to be done,' he said referring to the Bangladesh bank heist.</p><p>In February 2016, cyber criminals stole nearly $100 million from Bangladesh's central bank, which was connected with Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), one of the most secured information and money transfer networks globally. Shortly after that incident, Russian officials disclosed that hackers stole more than $31 million from their central bank and commercial banks. In November of the same year, \u00a32.5 million were stolen from 9,000 accounts of Tesco Bank, England.</p><p>Looming threat</p><p>Though major incidents, these are only a handful of examples of a looming threat facing financial institutions. Media reports suggest 2015 and 2016 were the busiest years in terms of cyber attacks on banks. And that's only the beginning. Given hackers had developed advanced techniques to breach existing security protocols, SWIFT warned that these attacks were set to rise globally.</p><p>Lo and behold! Barely five months into 2017, a major global attack 'WannaCry' already infected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries across the world. Last month's ransomware attack exploited a security flaw in Microsoft XP operating system. The attackers locked access to user files and demanded the target pay $300 if they wanted their files decrypted.</p><p>The attack wasn't targeted on Pakistan but the attackers did come here, Hussain saidand that was even before his prediction.</p><p>We could not find any official data about how many attacks have taken place in the past or value of losses suffered or amount recovered by banks. The State Bank of Pakistan's response to Profit's queries shared with them three weeks in advance was awaited till the filing of this report. Three of the top five commercial banks, we contacted for this article, didn't entertain us either, leaving many</p><p>important questions unanswered.</p><p>However, industry sources say cyberattacks are taking place on a daily basis and there is no system in place for sharing of such information or dealing with a sophisticated attack.</p><p>'Many cyberattacks are taking place in the country already. Our user data, such as credit card information, is being used by hackers on a daily basis but no one is sharing that information,' said Barrister Zahid Jamil, an international expert on cybercrime.</p><p>Pakistani banks, at least a few of them, are now looking set to transition from basic bricks and mortar model to the much-advanced digital banking, making online security even more relevant. But, almost all the experts we spoke to echoed Hussain's views, agreeing Pakistan has one of the world's weakest information security systems in place.</p><p>'One needs to make sure they have barriers to avoid such attacks and minimize the damage,' Group Chairman Standard Chartered PLC, Jose Vinals told Profit in his recent visit to Pakistan Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) is the first bank in Pakistan to move to internet banking.</p><p>Though he acknowledged banks all over the world are attacked every day, Vinals disagreed that banks were taking it lightly. 'Cyberattacks are at the top of the agenda for all international banks and many local banks in many countries of the world,' he said recalling his reflections from the meetings he had with heads of banks and regulatory bodies in many countries of the world.</p><p>The SCB's global chief said, they have upgraded their security system recently to make it more robust. 'It's impossible to say we are 100 percent protected, but we are doing our best to avoid such attacks,' he said.</p><p>Two-factor authentication, the way to go</p><p>When it comes to cyber security of banks, some experts say two-factor authentication is an effective and nearly foolproof technology because hackers can't access the target's mobile phone, where the banks send temporary codes. However, not all banks use this technology. Even those who do have limited its use to funds transfer while accessing one's account doesn't require this additional layer of security.</p><p>'In online banking there should be two to three factor authentication as opposed to the current practice where you go online, enter your password and access your account,' Jamil said. He argues that PIN and password model only ensures user authentication, but it doesn't tell if a document is tempered and that is apparently what happened in Bangladesh. SWIFT says it detected a simple malware on the bank's computer systems that targeted a PDF reader, used by the bank to check statement messages. Using malware, the hackers bypassed primary risk controls by tampering with the statements.</p><p>'The way they [banks] email monthly statements to clients without any password protection is very unsecure,' Jamil said of all Pakistani banks including SCB's local operations. The barrister says banks should use digital signature, which is more secured and ensures encryption of documents so that no one can tamper them.</p><p>Use of decentralized ledger system can be another way to prevent against cyberattacks, according to Skinner, the information security expert. 'Decentralize the structure of the system into lots of different servers around the network, rather than having one central server that runs the system,' he said during the digital banking summit while responding to a question. When a company has hundreds of points then hackers have to attack all of those to get a breach, which makes the institution far more secured than when they have only one central point, he added.</p><p>Other experts say hackers are more skilled in cyber security, therefore, only a combination of best technologies or an emergency response team, as opposed to a single solution, can help form a sound strategy. Apparently, Pakistan has none.</p><p>'We don't have any financial computer emergency response team (CERT) in Pakistan at the moment. If I can be specific, not a single bank is prepared to deal with any major cyberattack on their systems,' Jamil said.</p><p>Under CERT banks share data with each other and depute people on information sharing on real-time basis to address threats. In fact, the handling of recent attacks by private sector and the regulator indicates such information is restricted from becoming public.</p><p>For example, EasyPaisa and JazzCash, the digital payment platforms of two large cellular service providers (Telenor and Jazz respectively) were hacked but they didn't share any information with the industry. In fact, mobile accounts of JazzCash agents were compromised twice in a month despite the company's claim to have fixed the loopholes exploited by hackers in the first incident but they chose not to alert others in either case.</p><p>Similarly, the SMS service can be useful as customers can alert their bank in case of unauthorized access by hackers, but this is a paid feature that comes with a federal tax, which discourages consumers to avail this security layer.</p><p>Most banks in Pakistan have outsourced cyber security and call centers to third parties, which is dangerous from a security point of view because they are not bank employees, Jamil said. We could not figure out how much money banks are spending on information security and what their strategy is because none of those contacted, including the regulator, answered our queries.</p><p>'If a major cyber attack takes place on Pakistani banks, it will be a huge economic loss, it will be a loss of trust in electronic banking, and hurt the whole e-commerce sector,' Jamil said.</p><p>Banks not coming up with anything significant in digital arena</p><p>Hussain's prediction about a cyberattack on financial institutions wasn't the only bitter pill for bankers to swallow. His harshest forecast, which may have made bankers in the room rather uncomfortable, was the one about commercial banks' inability to do anything significant in the digital arena anytime soon.</p><p>Asked to explain, the founder of EasyPaisa said banks' business model doesn't make them hungry for fintechs. The numbers he shared seem to agree.</p><p>More than two-thirds of banks' earnings come from government treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, which require no brains. In a country of 200 million, there are only 1.8 million active banking customers, 40,000 point of sale machines, and 1.1 million credit card customers.</p><p>'It has been the same for the last 15 years,' Hussain said.</p><p>Most banks are in five big cities and are not expanding geographically. The total SME lending from banks has come down from 17 per cent to six per cent while credit to agriculture remains under six per cent.</p><p>'No one has really come up with an innovative model for a long time and this state of play will remain unchanged in near future,' Hussain said pointing towards the budget deficit, which forces the government to borrow. The government remains the single-largest borrower of banks for over a decade now.</p><p>'I have a sense that we [banks] will stay dependent on the government,' former finance minister Shaukat Tarin told Profit in a recent interview. Banking has a small footprint in the economy, for its coverage is only 33 percent of the GDP, he said. 'Some of these banks have almost forgotten how to lend and it will take them a long time to build the capacity to lend to customers.'</p><p>When the central bank started reducing its monetary policy rate in mid-2015, banks, which were enjoying 5 to 7 percent risk-free spreads, suffered notable losses in the years that followed. As a result, they shifted focus back to consumer lending.</p><p>Hussain, however, says most of this lending is going to the salaried class and not the self-employed people.</p><p>'By and large, expecting commercial banks, barring a few, to become tech savvy and provide their customers a digital journey is a long ask,' Hussain said.</p><p>The global stats for legacy banking seem to support his point of view. Only three percent amongst CEOs of leading banks have professional technology experience, according to Skinner, the fintech expert. Even at the board level, the number is only six per cent. 'When you have no one in the top management who understands fintech, you are fatally flawed,' the expert said. This, he says is the biggest problem for banks wanting to move to fintechs.</p><p>'The real challenge for banks is how to play in a marketplace when they are playing on a proprietary avenue,' he said adding it is difficult because it requires change in thinking and culture.</p><p>Agreeing with Skinner, Bank Alfalah Limited's then CEO Atif Bajwa said, the challenges of moving to digital banking essentially emanate from the old people in the boardroom. It reflects a mindset, traditional model of revenue, and traditional ways of delivering to the customers, he said.</p><p>'We have been in this comfort zone for so long that we are finding it difficult to transition very quickly,' Bajwa said, admitting the industry needs more people in the C-suite who understand fintech, which is the number one issue they face.</p><p>The legacy banking and old mindset at the board level may have been hindering the transition to digital banking, but that is not the challenge facing the industry. For example, BAFL had the most aggressive approach in expanding its digital footprint recently, but it still faced problems in certain aspects of digital banking.</p><p>When Bajwa took charge in 2012, digital was one of the two major areas of focus for the new management. They were one of the first banks to come into Point of Sale (PoS) machines business and grew their footprint very fast, according to Amaar Naveed Ikhlas, Head of Digital Banking at BAFL, which now accounts for 60 percent of the PoS machines in the market.</p><p>'To become the best transactional bank you have to make transactions easy, cheap, and user friendly in every way. And to do that, you need to go digital,' Ikhlas said, explaining why they focussed on digital.</p><p>BAFL had been able make some inroads to digital by increasing its ATM network from 300 in 2012 to 650 now. It makes payments to 350,000 EOBI customers and 1.1 million BISP beneficiaries besides moving Rs20 billion government to people in quarterly payments.</p><p>Despite notable success on digital front, Ikhlas doesn't seem to be happy with the existing digital payments ecosystem. They launched their own platform Mobile Paisa in collaboration with Warid, but it faded away after the latter's acquisition by Mobilink. Eventually, they had to continue their services through EasyPaisa agents' network because of customer convenience. But that didn't turn out to be viable for them.</p><p>Government pays BAFL and it puts the money into customers' accounts who either go to ATMs or agents to withdraw that money. 'For them this transaction is free and we compensate the agent from the fee we charge from government,' Ikhlas said. That is of every Rs10, up to 60 percent goes to the agents of EasyPaisa. Explaining, he said Jazz and Telenor let other players use their agents and charge the cost of management, which has opened up an opportunity for them to make more money at the expense of smaller players. 'The game is just of the fee business, there is no float,' he said.</p><p>Ikhlas is not the only one complaining about the duopoly of EasyPaisa and JazzCash. 'When you are charging Rs60 on a local remittance of Rs1,000, that is six per cent, it becomes very expensive,' Ufone's CEO Rainer Rathgeber said in an apparent reference to market leader EasyPaisa.</p><p>Speaking to a group of journalists in Karachi earlier this year, Rathgeber said, 98 percent of all fee is going to the agents and rest to the telcos or banks, which is not a successful model. 'The poorest is paying the highest and retailers are the only beneficiaries,' he said. This is one of the reasons why Ufone, the parent company of Ubank, is more into microfinance, and into payments, the CEO said.</p><p>Ikhlas, the BAFL's digital banking head, says the current mechanisms support big players like EasyPaisa and JazzCash but other players are not able to do it. He went a step further in suggesting people in Pakistan didn't do banking through mobile as it is done in other successful countries in the world.</p><p>'If we ask EasyPaisa about how many accounts are there in Telenor Bank, they might say 10 million, but how many are actively used is a different story,' he said, adding, agents' accounts are there, but not of consumers. In over the counter transaction, which still account for more than half of total branchless banking transactions, people at both ends are actually giving and taking actual cash. If one looks at over the counter transactions, the fee is under threat, he said, adding only Easy Paisa and JazzCash will survive because they have invested so much money in this.</p><p>In digital banking, the growth didn't come where it should have been. 'We are still stuck at the point for digital transactions to take a leap,' he said.</p><p>Shifting strategies</p><p>Banks are very proprietary right now, but over time, they will open up their system so that fintechs can integrate with them, Hussain says. And this, according to him, will be driven by customer pressure or regulatory requirement.</p><p>'If customers demand their information to be available with a particular fintech with their consent, the banks will have to comply or they will go to another bank,' Hussain said. 'Some banks will open up voluntarily because they see this as a business and build up a model where they make money but others will be forced to do it eventually,' he said. This has happened in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and other parts of the world, he said.</p><p>According to the PwC's latest study on fintechs, many financial services leaders fear losing business to innovators, starting with payments, fund transfer and personal finance sectors. The vast majority (88 percent) believed that part of their business is at risk to standalone fintech companies. 'This business risk is due to developments in fintech and has grown to an estimated 24 percent of revenues,' the study says.</p><p>'Innovation is coming from outside financial services and being driven by a variety of sources including tech companies, e-retailers, and social media platforms,' it says, adding this approach certainly has been prevalent in some Asian markets.</p><p>Hussain says a lot of banks have jumped into branchless banking but that is not necessarily a profitable business. 'It's a fat driven herd mentality as opposed to strategically thinking what needs to be done,' he said.</p><p>'Right now, they don't think fintech, but when they have figured out how profitable these fintechs can be and what the improved customer journey is, the same banks will have opened up to the fintech APIs and will look into acquiring them,' Hussain said.</p><p>Given fintechs are still in their infancy in the country, it may be too early to expect any merger or acquisition in this space, but recent developments indicate there have been several mergers and acquisitions in fintech space and there appears to be a shift in banks' strategies towards them.</p><p>According to Crowdfundinsider.com, 2015 saw 427 fintech mergers and acquisitions, up 14 percent over 2014. Similarly, the PwC's 2017-study on fintechs says funding of such startups has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 41 percent over the last four years, which comes down to over</p><p>$40 billion in cumulative investment.</p><p>Big banks' fintech investing strategies are shiting, CNBC reported in a post in April 2016. 'This year, big banks seem more eager to partner with or buyout startups challenging crucial lines of business in the financial services industry,' it said. More recently, banks are committing big bucks to buyouts and it comes after a year in which fintech funding hit new highs, it said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PAKTOD-PAKTOD0307201700027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PAKTOD2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NY0-01R1-JCH9-G0D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">384317</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nawa Media (Pvt.)

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Wednesday, July 3rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are showing gains across the board. A 61-point gain on the Dow futures. The markets will be closed tomorrow just for one day for the July 4th holiday here in the U.S. The S&amp;P up 8 points in futures trading. The S&amp;P of course, closed at another all-time high yesterday, second record in a row. The Dow and Nasdaq gaining as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, we have gains across the board to tell you about. In England, France and Germany, all those markets up more than six-tenths of 1 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, different story -- selling across the board as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal begin to fade a bit there. The biggest loser the Kospi in South Korea, off by nearly one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Healthcare in America -- attempts to block next week's Obamacare hearing fail. The hearing is a go. This as some drugs soar in price despite the President's promise that, well, he would keep drug costs in check, bring them down. A look at what is at stake.</p><p>Jim Beam up in flames, a major fire at its Kentucky bourbon warehouse. The latest on that blaze ahead in Woodford County, Kentucky.</p><p>Trouble for Facebook's crypto currency, House lawmakers asking the social media giant to put Libra on hold. The reasons why ahead.</p><p>Plus Crocs teaming up with a bad designer. Its new summer shoe getting a makeover and they don't look any better.</p><p>Here with me to break it all down this morning. Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton --</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes. Those Crocs are a little tough, I think. The flip flops are ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Market strategist, ThirdSeven Advisors --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BOLTON: No comment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike Block.</p><p>I'm trying not to be so negative. And the president of Cleary Strategies, former White House correspondent Ronica Cleary. I was very positive about the women's soccer celebration.</p><p>RONICA CLEARY, PRESIDENT, CLEARY STRATEGIES: Yes, you were.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, there is no such thing --</p><p>CLEARY: Unrelated to Crocs we might add.</p><p>I would just be -- absolutely hideous.</p><p>I want to talk about markets really quickly.</p><p>S&amp;P, Mike Block -- at an all-time high. And the 10-year treasury yield--</p><p>BOLTON: Two-year low, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- right, below 2 percent. Like 1.95 percent.</p><p>MIKE BLOCK, THIRDSEVEN ADVISORS: 1.95 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The yield curve, shorter term interest rates are still above longer term interest rates which historically has been a signal of a recession.</p><p>What in the name of all that is real is going on.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, that three-month (INAUDIBLE) is still above not just the two- year and five-year note but also the 10-year note. That remains inverted. And like you said it usually signals recession.</p><p>Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 made new highs yesterday. The Nasdaq and the Dow are within striking distance, something does not compute here. The data has not been horrible and it's not necessarily signaling a recession.</p><p>We had a decent ISM manufacturing on Monday --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it slowed but it was still -- it wasn't --</p><p>BLOCK: It's still above. But it should make people nervous here, 51.7 is nothing to celebrate. It's above 50 but it's nothing to celebrate.</p><p>BOLTON: Best comment I heard is coming from a portfolio manager at PIMCO who said essentially markets are pricing in the best case scenario and the worst case scenario. Both are priced to perfection.</p><p>So she said there's a rally in risk-free assets and then a rally in risk assets and she said essentially the market is pricing in heaven and separately the market is pricing in heck.</p><p>BLOCK: So if you have a portfolio --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can say hell.</p><p>BOLTON: All right.</p><p>BLOCK: -- where you're investing in stocks and bonds you're pretty happy right now. And again, there's some major strategies that are based on that. The thing is, where do we go from here.</p><p>Personally, I look at stocks and I say for the first time this year I've been relatively bullish all year. I look at these big tech stocks and I say well, maybe it's time for a little time-out here. We don't know how China's going to play out even if the G-20 went well.</p><p>Valuations are getting a little ahead of themselves. They're not ridiculous. But maybe there is a little steam that needs to come off. Meanwhile the bond market, the data -- the bond market seems to be in some kind of dysfunction. But is it really telling us to sell bonds here? I don't quite see it.</p><p>I think that's something that you can hold onto. Yields can drift down a bit. The curve needs to uninvert.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Reduce your stock allocation but hold your treasury allocation.</p><p>BLOCK: Or make it more defensive. Instead of buying tech, maybe you want to switch into something like real estate. I'm not just going to sit here and say oh buy utilities and consumer staples because I think the fundamentals there are disastrous.</p><p>Utilities have had a nice run but someone needs to explain to me what the fundamental case there other than it's rate sensitive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BLOCK: And it's safe. Nothing else.</p><p>BOLTON: I don't think that about China. There are -- Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Microsoft Amazon -- all considering moving manufacturing out of China. Google, Sony, Nintendo -- I mean this is going to have some long-term consequences, of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So the President, whatever his strategy is, like it or not, it's working. It is sending a signal to these nations that you should not -- these companies that you cannot depend on China.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that you basically sold your soul in essence by moving production there and they're trying to diversify their manufacturing base. I would suggest --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. Looking at some Southeast Asian countries, among others, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: U.S.A. U.S.A.</p><p>Coming up this morning -- Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue; New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew; Valet Living CEO Shawn Handrahan; and from the Heritage Foundation Marie Fishpaw.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of those folks.</p><p>Our top story this half hour, crisis at the border, the situation at detainment facilities called out by one official as a ticking time bomb, in a new Department of Homeland Security watchdog report. The Office of Inspector General warning about dangerous over-crowding in border patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.</p><p>This on the heels of a federal judge in Seattle blocking the Trump administration from detaining asylum seekers while they pursue their cases.</p><p>Joining me now is former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Tom Homan. Tom -- I'm sure you read this inspector general report. What do you make of it and what can and will the Trump administration do to alleviate this, what is very disturbing overcrowding in these facilities?</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR ICE: Well, look, these facilities weren't built for these family groups. And the administration made that clear for months. These are jails. They're built for mostly single adults, that's usually about 90 percent of what border patrol apprehends.</p><p>But when the family groups come across, it's either detain them longer to make sure you know who they are before they're released or just release them from the border which is unacceptable.</p><p>So the administration has asked Congress for months please give money to the Department and HHS so more family type beds can be found, more children beds can be found, which are built for that purpose. They have facilities there for the children, the medical care for the children. They just passed something out of the courts.</p><p>But it will help, but it's late. So all these pictures are nothing the border patrol can prevent. These men and women are doing the best job they can during a humanitarian crisis without any assistance from Congress for months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to go through the numbers because the numbers are staggering and the report is disturbing and anybody who reads it would be upset about it.</p><p>But the question is what's going to be done about it. More than 332,000 migrants traveling as families have been arrested at the border since the start of the last fiscal year in October. That is more than any other full year. A 56,000 unaccompanied children have crossed the border illegally since October.</p><p>If you go back and look at -- compare that to the deportation numbers -- 332,000 migrant families, President Obama, his peak in deportations was only a little bit more than 400,000. And this is October, just October not even a full fiscal year.</p><p>So in terms of the number of families coming in, in the current year, will top the number of deportations, even a record during the Obama administration. So how would this money -- is this money enough, this $4.6 billion, Tom, that was approved last week by the House and the Senate and by President Trump. Is more money going to be needed at the border?</p><p>HOMAN: Well, absolutely. This money will douse the flames for now. But if you notice, that bill did not really address the enforcement component of all this. Without interior enforcement, you got no border security.</p><p>And you're right. The numbers are staggering. Back during the Obama administration when the family numbers were less than half of this --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HOMAN: -- we built 3,000 family detention beds. We built the facilities for the unaccompanied children that came across, the so-called (INAUDIBLE). All that was done in FY14 and 15 when numbers were half this.</p><p>But the leadership for the Democratic Party on the Hill still does not recognize this as a crisis at the level it actually is.</p><p>So the money will help. But there's going to be more money to be needed. Because there needs to be interior enforcement. I've said for months on this network, those families and adults that came across, they had due process at great taxpayer expense, billions of dollars spent on the whole system. When the federal judge orders them to leave, they must leave.</p><p>In FY15 I did this. And we did a nation wide operation and the border numbers plummeted after we did it because we showed there's a consequence and deterrence to committing immigration fraud.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the President has promised raids, interior raids to basically get people out of the country who have been through due process. Do you think that happens, because it's --</p><p>HOMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- been delayed.</p><p>HOMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And again, certainly the leadership in a lot of these cities is pushing back on that like Chicago, for example.</p><p>HOMAN: Well, it's a sanctuary city, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HOMAN: Either there's a rule of law or there isn't. I mean if a federal judge comes out with an order says you must leave, if the order is not carried out, if that order doesn't mean anything, there's no integrity in the entire system.</p><p>Just open the border up, let everybody come in because there's no consequence, no return. And I'll say this. Look, I've done this for 34 years. It's unfortunate and it's sad. It is. But it's a either that or open borders. We can't have both.</p><p>So I think the President has the right agenda. I think that nationwide operations needs to happen. Of course, the left's going to show pictures of children crying and women being arrested. But the other option is no border.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, there's certainly -- and I said this yesterday, with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and she makes this trip to the border and part of her accusations were people being told -- women being told to drink out of the toilet. But this woman did not -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not vote for this aid. She voted no on this humanitarian aid. And Speaker Pelosi knew that something needed to be done and she was not pushed and not dominated by the far left past of her Democratic caucus.</p><p>HOMAN: Ocasio-Cortez lost all credibility. No one's making anything anybody drink out of a toilet. If you look at the commode in these detention centers they same we have in ICES, you have a commode, on top there's a sink.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't want to debate what she said and what she didn't say. I know what the numbers speak. And she didn't vote for that $4.6 billion in aid. And she -- for whatever reason, she said that she talked to her constituents and they told her that they didn't -- that they didn't want her to vote for it.</p><p>CLEARY: Well, if I can just hop in here, I think it was just last week when the employees at Wayfair were infuriated that they were purchasing beds for facilities. There's this very -- I can't understand the logic when you don't vote for the funding, when you think we shouldn't purchase beds. We are dealing with a crisis and if we are attempting to address it in a humanitarian way, w can't have leaders in the party now sort of dictating a narrative that doesn't make sense to solve the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the leader of the Democratic Party pushed for the aid.</p><p>HOMAN: Well look, the leaders --</p><p>CLEARY: The social media leaders and AOC --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You need to give her credit for that.</p><p>HOMAN: First of all, I give Nancy Pelosi no credit because she never came to the table during this crisis. 31 percent of women are being raped making this trip. Children are dying. And I've said for months. They're going to continue to die as long as they keep loopholes open.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi only came to the table when she heard President Trump is going to enforce law in the interior United States and remove people that had final orders. That's when she came to the table, to protect illegal immigrants who had due process in the country.</p><p>That's what turned her around to come to the table. Not the deaths, not the rapes, none of that brought her to the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think that a lot -- like Senator Lindsey Graham has a bill, and it was the William Wilburforst (ph) Child Trafficking Act from lat3 2008, before President Obama was inaugurated in January '09 that basically opened the door for children to--- basically encouraged unaccompanied minors to be sent here because it makes it more difficult to deport them and to send them back to their home countries if they're noncontiguous with the U.S.</p><p>Among the things Senator Graham wants to fix that. Is there any chance between now and the election next year that something on immigration is tweaked and fixed and the holes closed.</p><p>HOMAN: I hope so but I'm pessimistic. I think Lindsey Graham's bill works. The TVPRA had a really good purpose to protect kids form trafficking but you're right. They've used that as a loophole to come across the country.</p><p>But one thing people aren't talking about, when did these families start coming? FY13. What happened in FY 12? DACA. These family groups coming across now are your next DACA population as these children were brought to the country no fault of their own. That's when this all started.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Tom, part of the problem is, whether these families are seeking asylum or not, it is the economy in this country. The economy is so strong, that it's giving them incentive to come here.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, the President of El Salvador saying he has failed, he took responsibility for that which thought was really standout.</p><p>HOMAN: Two things on the economy, it would be nice for the Democrats to recognize the economy is doing well and fix the system. If we need more employment in this country then fix the system and give the guest worker program. Let's just not keep bringing illegal aliens that bankroll criminals organizations and rape women and kill children.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the jobs are here for guest workers. Tom Homan -- good to see you. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A judge cutting a major award in a Roundup cancer case. Cheryl Casone has the details on this. Hey -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the question by how much. A judge in San Francisco said that he would reduce the amount to $50 million or less after a federal jury awarded $80 million to a man who was diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>Bayer which bought Roundup maker Monsanto last year is insisting that Roundup is safe for human use. The company faces lawsuits by more than 13,000 plaintiffs in the United States.</p><p>Meanwhile in Austria, lawmakers there voted yesterday to ban a key chemical that is used in Roundup. Shares of Bayer are down nearly 40 percent from a year ago.</p><p>House Democrats are calling on Facebook to halt work on its crypto currency project, Libra. The five Democrats led by House financial services committee chair Maxine Waters wants regulators to look at concerns about hacking along with data and global financial security. Waters' committee is going to hold a hearing on Libra on July 17th -- same day as the Mueller testimony.</p><p>Ok. Crocs are getting a makeover from Vera Bradley. The company has teamed up with Vera Bradley to create some new designs for the clogs popular with boaters and nurses everywhere. The new shoes go for between $40 and $50. They're available in-store and online.</p><p>Dagen -- I know you want them now. You better hurry. They're selling out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that you kind of have to own your ugliness and Crocs are ugly, so why and try and gussy it up, so-to-speak.</p><p>CASONE: Or just make them more ugly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With some Vera Bradley floral which I think are ugly too. So ugly plus --</p><p>CASONE: They're unique.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- ugly plus ugly doesn't make pretty.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. I'm good without the Crocs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Thank you Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, helping America's heroes. My next guest's company unveiling a new program making life easier for our military members and veterans.</p><p>Plus Waymo getting the go-go the go ahead. The self-driving company given a permit to operate in one western state. Details ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back.</p><p>As we celebrate our Fourth of July holiday, it's important to stop and thank the men and women who have fought for our freedom and continue to fight for our freedom.</p><p>My next guest's company provides luxury amenities for residential living -- amenities, services in say apartment complexes. And now he's doing more to help America's heroes.</p><p>Joining us now, Valley Living president and CEO, Shawn Handrahan. Shawn -- tell us about what you're doing for veterans.</p><p>SHAWN HANDRAHAN, CEO, VALLEY LIVING: Yes. So we -- the genesis of the program started about four years ago. I had a meeting with former Congressman Jeff Miller -- former congressman Jeff Miller and Blackstone and New Mountain Capital and look to hire more veterans.</p><p>We started doing that, went from 11 to a little over 300. Started sponsoring warrior games and wounded warrior ride to recovery, things of that sort and then we said we need to give more to our veterans that live in -- besides just saying thank you for your service we want to be able to give more in return back.</p><p>So we started this process to where communities and family members and friends could nominate veterans that live in apartments. And then we would go through a selection process and we'd choose one and provide a full suite of amenities where there's home cleaning, pet walking, package delivery, grocery facilitation to that veteran for a year.</p><p>CLEARY: My husband served in the Marine Corps. And I have to say, the veterans community and the people that we know there are two things you can't help but notice. It is a very difficult transition back to civilian life. And I think it's very difficult for veterans to ask for help.</p><p>I have to believe there's a tremendously positive response, especially for injured veterans, those who may have lost limbs, those who have difficulties doing their day-to-day tasks and the help that you serve must just be tremendously appreciated.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Yes, you know, it's interesting you say that. There was a gentleman, I won't give his last name, his name is Andy that's a disabled vet that actually we selected him and he said it's kind of transformed his live because he and his family are dealing with so much. He's wheelchair- bound.</p><p>So we were very pleased to be able to offer that. But the other thing is part of our service, our waste and recycling service is a nighttime part time deal. And some of the veterans that are returning back that had seen combat as they assimilate back into society, working outside, unsupervised, at night tends to be a great steppingstone to bring them back into the workforce.</p><p>BLOCK: Shawn -- it's a great growing business. And you know, the secular trend is towards more rentals and multifamily. I'm looking through what Valley Living does and it occurs to me there might be a corporate application here as well.</p><p>Is that a market you've considered entering. It would be a wonderful way that you can expand veteran employment even more.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Yes, we have. We looked at it. We have so much going on right now. I mean we just acquired a company called Torch Fitness. And we're offering fitness amenities. We support 1.3 million apartment homes every year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Across the country.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Across the country. So we've got 6,500 plus, associates. We have a lot of opportunity. I think that's something that we could consider down the future. But right now, we've got to kind our head down.</p><p>BOLTON: You mentioned the two private equity firms, was it a tough sell to them or did they see the value right away?</p><p>HANDRAHAN: No, they saw the value, actually. Blackstone committed to hire 8,000 people over the next five years through all their portfolio companies. And New Mountain Capital also did the same thing.</p><p>Fortunately for us, we were acquired by Aries and Harvest and they allowed us to continue to facilitate that program. So we're not near as large as some companies. But to get to 300, we committed to 300 by 2020 and we exceeded that by the beginning of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So 5 percent of your workforce is made up of veterans, roughly.</p><p>HANDRAHAN : Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where do you see that number five years from now?</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Yes. I think as we continue to work with the local bases, we're based out of Tampa, to MacDill is there. I'm a Pensacola, Florida boy so Pensacola Naval Air Station. We're working with the bases of the Veterans Departments to be able to post those jobs internally. We would like to get it to 8 to 10 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's a awesome.</p><p>It's different growing up in the sought, in the rural south, and where you spend a lot of time in and around bases like eastern North Carolina for example, It's Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point. Seymore Johnson (ph) Air Force Base. You really have a different sense of the sacrifice. You have a different sense of the needs of people who are coming out of the military, who are leaving service and entering private life again.</p><p>And I encourage people to really get to -- to get to know those communities, people who are in service and who have served.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>Yes. It is a different mindset and you feel exactly the pain that they're going through. But we're a servant leadership type company and what better pool of candidates to pull from than veterans that have come back because they exhibit that relentless effort, flawless execution and serve at leadership that we try embody.</p><p>MCDOWELL: On that note, a shout-out to Tom Bryant, my buddy at Nascar -- who was -- well, he served. He served admirably. I'll just leave it at that.</p><p>Shawn -- good to see you.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Good to see you. Thank you for your time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Shawn Handrahan.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Happy Fourth to you.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Happy Fourth of July.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How are you celebrating?</p><p>HANDRAHAN: I'm going to be out on the bay, watching the fireworks in Pensacola, Florida.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nice, I love it.</p><p>HANDRAHAN: Yes, we'll have fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up healthcare in America, drug prices rising. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to keep them down. We take a closer look at what is going on.</p><p>Plus imagine a trip to Taco Bell where you can't get a burrito. Or a quesadilla, the fast food chain facing a shortage of tortillas.</p><p>MCDOWELL,: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Wednesday, July 3rd. Your top stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Futures are showing gains across the board, a 49 point gain on the Dow Futures. But watch the S&amp;P, it's up more than six points. The S&amp;P after closing at an all-time high for the second day in a row. The NASDAQ and the Dow also gaining yesterday.</p><p>In Europe, we have some buying across the board in England, France and Germany. But it was a completely different story in Asia overnight. Red across the board as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal, we got the truce, we're starting to make some phone calls back and forth. Lighthizer and Liu He from China trading some phone calls there, but where do we go from here? We have losses across the board in Asia.</p><p>Jim Beam up in flames, a major fire at Jim Beam's Kentucky bourbon warehouse, the latest on that blaze ahead in Woodford County, Kentucky.</p><p>No driver needed, Waymo self-driving cars now allowed to carry passengers, but there is a catch.</p><p>And a tortilla shortage at Taco Bell, what is behind this crisis?</p><p>And it's not too late to book a trip for the holiday weekend, where you can find some last minute deals, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, healthcare in America, a federal appeals court rejecting a request for a delay in next week's hearing on the constitutionality of President Obama's healthcare law.</p><p>Joining me now, director of Domestic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, Marie Fishpaw. Marie, what do you make of this decision and what's going to come out of this hearing?</p><p>MARIE FISHPAW, DIRECTOR OF DOMESTIC POLICY STUDIES, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Well, no matter what happens with next week's hearing, Obamacare is not going to change any time in the near future. So if you are getting your benefits from Obamacare right now, nothing is going to change for the foreseeable future. This court case has a while to go, it's going to wind its way through the legal system and may well end up at the Supreme Court.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) The most useful thing about next week's developments is that it's a good reminder for all of us that Congress is going to eventually have to come back to health reform and deal with it, because only they can really tackle some of the real reasons that costs have gone up so much and choices have gone down for consumers under Obamacare.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's going to happen, do you think, because this is a debate that's playing out in the race for the Democratic nomination for president, where you have some individuals, paltry few willing to raise their hand on a debate stage and say, I want to take private insurance away from 180 million people. But nevertheless, a lot of talk about a public option in the Affordable Care Act. How do you see the fix playing out in the next year, next two years, for Obamacare?</p><p>FISHPAW: Well, the left has made it really clear that they have their preferred solution to Obamacare. They'd like to move on as well. And replace it with a government-run program for all of us, and that outlaws our private health insurance. Those somewhat to the right of that would like to do similar things that would end up in my view getting us to the same place, just more slowly.</p><p>And the public option is, these are all options that double down on the same recipe as we've seen that have led to higher costs, fewer choices for consumers. So the conservatives need to come up with an alternative that speaks well to those real concerns by Americans and conservatives have been working to do just that over the last few years. We've come up with a proposal that would lower costs by 30 percent while increasing private coverage.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: Hi, Marie, it's Mike Block here. You know, a lot -- a lot of what we hear from Republican Party is really based upon this repeal and replace. And we never quiet hear the replace part of that. So you know, the solutions that you're speaking of here, you know, what does that really entail? Is it a repeal and replace or is it -- is it making adjustments to ACA? You know, can that poss -- can that work under, you know, what we're seeing here?</p><p>FISHPAW: I think it can work. The -- real -- one of the reasons costs have gone up so much in recent years is that Obama gives insurance companies and more taxpayer dollar every time they raise prices which is a real recipe for the kind of cost increases and choice decreases we've seen.</p><p>So, one of the things that needs to be done is to address that. The Trump administration is taking all the steps within their power that they can to provide relief now. And that's leading to real cost reductions in some states that have gotten waivers from some of the more rigorous Obamacare mandates. So we've seen costs come down in those states, coverage go up, all through tools that help protect pre-existing conditions.</p><p>So we need Congress to do more to enable some of the relief that's already been put in place in smaller ways by the Trump administration.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about -- (INAUDIBLE) what are some of the other things that the Trump administration has done to basically open the insurance market to more individuals?</p><p>FISHPAW: Well, they've done a lot to increase choices. Doing things that will re-lead to lower costs, both for individuals and hopefully down the road for more people, even if they aren't in those plans.</p><p>One of the biggest steps they took recently was a new regulation that came out in the last couple weeks that allows employers to offer effectively defined contribution to health contri -- health plans rather than defined benefits. So people can buy the plan that makes sense for them rather than having their employer do it, buy it for them. This is really going to help small businesses who may not be able to afford to offer the Obamacare plans that have such expensive premiums on the market today.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Marie, if there were one change and I heard that you said, Congress needs to be more involved, but if there were one change that you could just magically wave a wand and have in place in the next 30 days, what would it be?</p><p>FISHPAW: It would be to shift the notion that there is one change that can solve the problem.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, touche.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She just stabbed you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: I want the information.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I'm just -- I'm just kidding. But it's -- but again, that's how these Democrats are selling their idea of -- they call it Medicare for All but it's not Medicare for anybody. It gets rid of Medicare, it gets rid of private insurance in this country. But there -- but that is the messaging, is oh, dealing with the health insurance market is so difficult. Let me, Elizabeth Warren, take that on for you. I'll make decisions about your coverage, what you -- what health services you'll get, what health services you'll want. That's the messaging.</p><p>FISHPAW: Right. And I -- that's good messaging, because in the sense that Americans are frustrated and we're right to be frustrated with many aspects of our healthcare system. You know, costs are too high. We don't perceive we're getting value. And there's so much paperwork and red tape that we have to deal with. And it's frustrating to patients and it's frustrating to doctors.</p><p>But the answer to that is not more of the same reasons that created our frustrations in the first place which is misappropriate government regulation and financing of the system. We really need to peel away the layers of the onion if you will, that have led to the mess we're in and end up with a place that really empowers patients and doctors to work directly together on the provision of their healthcare.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, won't insurance companies have a problem with that?</p><p>FISHPAW: Well, insurance companies do benefit from the current financing model that we have. But I think that at the end of the day, putting people in charge of their healthcare decisions will end up in a -- in a similar -- end up in a more robust market where costs can come down and people can buy the right plans that work for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I wanted to ask you a quick question if we can go back to that, and I'm doing my T.V. anchor best in the teleprompter. Prescription drug prices are up 10.5 percent over the last six months, this is according to Rx Savings Solutions, despite pressure from the Trump administration and Congress to lower these prices. What's going on here, Marie?</p><p>FISHPAW: Well, I mean, the first thing is Congress and the administration is right to be looking at rising prescription drug costs, just like all rising healthcare costs. It is a major point of frustration for consumers in part because we don't really know what's going on or why things are that the prices are moving around the way they are.</p><p>But it's really important that policy makers who are taking a really hard look at this continue to try to figure out the root causes for why we ended up in this situation. And a lot of it has to do with misregulation after misregulation from the government, applied onto a situation where the real signals of the market can get distorted.</p><p>So, the more that the policy makers can take a hard look at what's happening there, the more I think they can figure out how to get the incentives right to reverse the situation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Marie Fishpaw, thanks so much for being here. Great to see you. Have a happy fourth.</p><p>FISHPAW: Thank you, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Come back soon. Coming up, Waymo getting the go ahead, the self-driving company giving a perm -- given a permit to shuttle passengers. The rules it needs to follow, however.</p><p>Plus, thinking of the beach, the top travel deals as Americans get ready to celebrate the fourth. Live from Lido Beach, New York.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Cheryl Casone with some headlines we're watching.</p><p>Multiple crews are fighting a major fire at a Jim Beam warehouse in Kentucky. These flames as you can see happening overnight to barrel warehouses is at Jim Beam aging facility, caught fire. It started late last night and the fire is still burning. The facility holds about 45,000 barrels of bourbon, two buildings are damaged, but so far no one is hurt. The cause of that fire hasn't been identified. But it may have been sparked by lightning.</p><p>Well, Waymo's gotten the green light from California regulators to start carrying people in its self-driving cars. The pilot program going to allow employees and guests to use the service. The passengers won't get charged for the ride and there is going to be a test driver behind the wheel. Approval of the three-year permit, a major step forward in Waymo's plans to launch a commercial service. Waymo a unit of Google parent Alphabet, Alphabet is up a half a percent in the premarket.</p><p>Finally this, Taco Bell has been struck by a major tortilla shortage. And because of this, Taco Bell restaurants are temporarily reducing menu selections because they don't have 10 inch tortillas which are used in the restaurants, burritos, quesadillas and other items. Taco Bell says the supplier issue caused the shortage. Taking a look at the parent company Yum Brands, up 20 percent so far this year.</p><p>Michael Block, the stock may be up but people are going to be down when they hear that there's a tortilla shortage happening at Taco Bell.</p><p>BLOCK: It's one of these things where you think to yourself, they had one job here, one job is tortillas. You know, there's like an old letterman sketch where there was someone like pranking people at the Taco Bell drive- in, going back saying, did you hear they're out of tacos here? No, so I mean, this sort of reminds me of right away. It's one thing.</p><p>BOLTON: I like this one job, you're like, come on, Yum Brands, you're not trying to like produce a movie at the same time.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, it's this funny thing.</p><p>BOLTON: And Twitter is going bananas about this.</p><p>CASONE: It really is, that's true.</p><p>BLOCK: It's the high class problem or what? And you know, the Waymo news is exciting as well just looking at that. That is going to become normal technology's advancing. Of course the question is, OK, whose first? But you know, again, that could be something that's interesting for Alphabet's stock, just putting the stock ticker hat on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And to your point, Michael, and that's a good point, they are going to have people in the -- in the driver's seat, test drivers as a backup. So, we'll see how it goes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: I think it's a lot more reassuring.</p><p>BLOCK: They can go to the Taco Bell drive-through unless until they figure out this tortilla mess.</p><p>CASONE: There's the plan. Guys, thanks so much.</p><p>All right, we've got a lot more coming up, everybody. Celebrating America, millions of Americans are hitting the road for the holiday weekend. We have got the top travel trends, coming up next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're celebrating this nation's independence at the Malibu Beach Club in Lido Beach, New York. Lauren Simonetti is there with Conde Nast contributing editor Mark Ellwood with a look at some trip ideas, last minute. Hi, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, Dagen. If you need some vitamin sea, if you get my drift, we have some options for you here from the beautiful beach club of Malibu in Lido Beach. Here's Mark Ellwood and we were chatting. This guy, the contributing travel editor to Conde Nast Traveler,</p><p>MARK ELLWOOD, CONTRIBUTING TRAVEL EDITOR, CONDE NAST TRAVELER: Yes, that's it.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I've been practicing. He's been to over a hundred countries. So I was saying to him, OK, it's July 3rd, I've got no plans. 50 million people are basically travelling this weekend. I feel like I need to stay home to avoid the mess. And you say, no, there's places to go.</p><p>ELLWOOD: I don't think you -- I don't think you should give up. You know, don't be -- don't be dissuaded that so many are on travelling. They're travelling for a reason. And look, remember, I've been to a lot of places overseas but there's plenty of places right in our backyard. I think if it's July 4th, you want to celebrate America, you want to go to some all- American places, can I recommend somewhere that I would go?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Please do.</p><p>ELLWOOD: I would go to St. Louis. Because I think that arch in St. Louis, which looks like a boomerang, some giant threw from outer space, this big silver, crazy thing, was just renovated, $400 million, almost $400 million they spent on it to sort of celebrate America's history. There's a new museum, there's a great park, and there's a very good July 4th celebration around there. So you're getting sort of recent American history.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK.</p><p>ELLWOOD: I would also send you to Philly because that's really for the beginning. Now as a British person, I should really recommend this, should I?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Love it, keep doing --</p><p>ELLWOOD: I was going to say, I'll take it -- I'll take it. Signing the Declaration of Independence right there, Philly really goes doubles down on July 4th. You get, you know, Betsy Ross will lead you singing happy birthday. Jennifer Hudson's got a concert, great thing.</p><p>SIMONETTI: There's also some trends that people are following right now. Whether that's glamping or weekending, or I call it camp nanny when you send the kids off to the grandparents. But there's apparently another name it, what do you know?</p><p>ELLWOOD: Do you know what I was -- I would say, we call it -- we call it glamping. Let's talk about glamping, glamour camping. Instead of camping out on grandma's backyard, why don't you take your kids to like an American safari? How does that sound?</p><p>SIMONETTI: An American safari?</p><p>ELLWOOD: What do you think about that? Does that sound good?</p><p>SIMONETTI: I'm on board.</p><p>ELLWOOD: Are you game?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Bug spray included?</p><p>ELLWOOD: You know, I think you have to bring your own bug spray but you can make smores. All of these glamping sites, you're sort of glamour camping. They basically want to get you to enjoy the outdoors without roughing it. So there'll be barbecue pits, there'll be places to make smores, there'll be lounge areas. There are lots of sites like this, they're very affordable. There's this -- there's a site in Utah, there's a site on Governors Island just off Manhattan. And in fact, not far from us in mountains, there is a site, so we can go -- we can go there afterwards.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So that trend is actually called skip-gening.</p><p>ELLWOOD: Oh no, that's glamping. If you want to talk about skip-gening, it's very interesting, that's skip generation travel. Get what I did there?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>ELLWOOD: So this is when grandparents take their grandchildren away without the parents. So the parents go, we want a weekend away.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>ELLWOOD: OK, I can see where you're going with this. And the grandparents say, I'd like some quality time with my grandkids.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's great exercise for the grandparents.</p><p>ELLWOOD: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Millennials are doing the week ending thing, what is that?</p><p>ELLWOOD: So, weekending, I think you've noticed, a lot of companies are changing their vacation policy. Often giving things like unlimited vacation, Netflix does that. So suddenly people have more vacation than they know what to do with. But they also sort of are a little hesitant to book extra weeks off.</p><p>And one recent survey showed that among millennials, 80 percent of them would rather do a whole load of long weekends instead of one big trip a year. So we're seeing hotels opening just outside big cities so you can drive into them.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You are full of ideas. And I wanted to get your thoughts on one more. I wouldn't call it a trend, it's actually a staple of how we travel. Cruises, how have they changed? Would you recommend them? Which ones?</p><p>ELLWOOD: OK, how many -- I mean, so many questions. I've got them all covered. We are obsessed with cruises right now. We've got a brand new cruise issue on the East End.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Obsessed with cruises.</p><p>ELLWOOD: Obsessed.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, convince me.</p><p>ELLWOOD: So, I would say people don't realize that cruises are actually a great last minute travel choice. You can book up to 96 hours before you go, always book with a travel specialist, we called them travel agents in the past, travel specialist now. They'll give you the best price, a lot of ship board bonuses. But you can save up to 80 percent, that's eight, zero.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Wow.</p><p>ELLWOOD: If you book at the last minute.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And why is that? Because the cruise lines are thinking we can't really sail a half empty ship, so we might as well give a deal, fill it. And we know you're going to eat and drink a lot --</p><p>ELLWOOD: See, I don't -- I don't even need to be here. Exactly, that's why. In other words, they --</p><p>SIMONETTI: That's the way how it works, you can get 80 percent off?</p><p>ELLWOOD: Up to 80 percent off. But you'll get at least half off of those last minute sailing. You've got to be flexible. Remember, you can't say I want the penthouse suite on this ship no matter what.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right.</p><p>ELLWOOD: And always check what the flight will be because you don't want to get a great deal on your cruise and realize your flight prices are crazy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right, but here in New York, you can just go straight to a -- to the -- to the harbor.</p><p>ELLWOOD: I mean, you just jump on-board. Like that's perfect.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Dagen, any ideas of what you might want to do for the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love all of Mark's ideas and tell him I said that because I always tell people before you go overseas, see America. See the west. Go to St. Louis. I was cheering when he said that. That's the Eero Saarinen and the Finnish-American architect designed that arch.</p><p>And if you don't want to go to St. Louis, you can just drive out to JFK because he designed the TWA terminal, the old TWA terminal out there which has reopened. So I love all of those ideas.</p><p>And Rhonda one of my favorite people, Rhonda Haynes, who works here, she's a camera operator, a film maker, she just went on her first cruise to Alaska. So that's another way to see America. Yey, Rhonda. Yes, so I'm not a cruise person, though, but I'll drive.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I still have to figure my weekend out, but I got information from Mark.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just send them -- send the kids to grandparents. Lauren Simonetti. We'll see you next hour. Thank Mark, Mark Ellwood.</p><p>Jobs in America, were get the ADP report on private sector job creation, that's in about 15 minutes' time. We'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019070302cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGM-B1P1-DXH2-6101-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002M2R</classCode><className>TACO BELL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5812 EATING PLACES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Please excuse any typos or errors in how I capture proceedings.&lt;nl/&gt; Session Description&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> 9:10 am Keynote Address: Ann R. Klee, VP Global Operations - Environment, Health ...fety, General Electric Company&lt;nl/&gt;A maven of the corporate law business, Brackett Denniston III, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of GE [called away - Ann is his substitute], has steered the legal department of his $150 billion conglomerate through growth, turbulence and restructuring, ranging from major acquisitions, to the company's selling most of its finance arm, GE Capital. In a keynote address, Denniston will lay out his views on what it takes to be a strong lawyer in today's changing business landscape, and what he perceives to be the most critical issues driving the relationship between in-house lawyers and outside counsel.&lt;nl/&gt; Discussion&lt;nl/&gt; Ann has a team of 1800 people in her organization. Will explain how GE has changed and continues to change. Then discuss how the legal organization changes how it works. And finally guiding principles for success.&lt;nl/&gt; The one thing constant at GE is change. The company has sold off many units, bought others, and invested heavily to become the software company of the future. (RF: There have been many articles about GE investment in the Internet of Things.)&lt;nl/&gt; As in-house lawyers, we face several challenges. The operating environment is complex, for example, 170 countries. Regulatory structures have become more complex globally. Cyberthreats grow by the day. Lawyering in this environment is simply more expensive.&lt;nl/&gt; Our outside counsel cost is increasing at faster than the rate of inflation. GE drives a very hard bargain with firms. Demands competitive bidding, shifting work to smaller and regional firms. Former profit centers for some law firms - specifically eDiscovery - are gone; GE has pulled that work in-house.\u00a0To address the challenge of delivering legal advice, the company is transforming its culture and leveraging technology.&lt;nl/&gt; In 2012, GE launched 'simplification initiative' to drive down SG...osts. It was not just about cost reduction but also to drive support organizations to become more focused on serving customers, internally and externally. One example from recent past: required over 100 legal approvals for lease in Africa. Another example: completely different contract terms across divisions.&lt;nl/&gt; The law department has simplified contracts and streamlined compliance procedures around KYC. It has done other process improvements. Integrated legal teams around investigations, L...government relations, M...environmental - across business units. For example, investigations unit was able to hire very high quality investigators who know local markets around the world. Saving millions of dollars by insourcing and getting much higher quality.&lt;nl/&gt; Consolidating legal work across fewer firms. Had worked with &gt;2000 firms. Now down to 40 firms in US. Over 600 in Europe to about 70. Reduced outside spend by about $60M from this convergence.&lt;nl/&gt; Being asked to do less with less. We must focus on what's really important.&lt;nl/&gt; The big tech disruptor for GE is the industrial Internet. We collect huge volumes of data to optimize performance of our industrial equipment. This creates new legal issues. Team has to think about privacy, security, and IP.&lt;nl/&gt; Law department must keep things simple. Focus on what's most important and doing that. Stop doing lower value work. That has been really hard for many of the company's lawyers.&lt;nl/&gt; The need to focus is an increasingly important lawyer skill. This includes project management skills and knowing what to focus on. Most of our work is not bet the company. We must look at process analysis, IT, systematization to manage most of our legal work to be more efficient. Using Spotfire to get real-time data on all legal matters. Helps evaluate efficiency of outside counsel.&lt;nl/&gt; GE lawyers integrate with the business, working closely with business teams.&lt;nl/&gt; Unyielding integrity is a key principle. Speed and efficiency are important but not at expense of integrity. Moral case is strong but so is business case. Every dollar on a bribe is one dollar less available for innovation.&lt;nl/&gt; In closing\u2026 navigate a world that looks very different than most lawyers are used to. Business of law today is more challenging than in the past. But this means for lawyers willing to embrace uncertainty and ambiguity, there are many opportunities. It's a great time for lawyers who want to be business partners.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; The post Critical Issues in Relationship between Lawyers and Clients - Live from Bloomberg Big Law Summit[2] appeared first on Prism Legal[3].&lt;nl/&gt;

Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Zoraida Sambolin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are bringing you the news from A to Z. It's 5:00 a.m. in the East. So, let's get started here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>looking to bring an early end to the war in Afghanistan. The GOP is blasting that announcement, saying not so fast. This is a bit premature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BANFIELD: All right. Also, if you were looking at these pictures, if you're the police officer who is running the dash cam, what is that going across the sky?</p><p>I'm trying to hum that song. That's a pathetic effort.</p><p>Anyway, some people very concerned about the UFO possibilities here. We have the answer to what that fireball in the sky was.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Is that do, do, do? What are you trying to do?</p><p>BANFIELD: I was thinking about that '80s show, that '90s show, whatever.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: OK, now.</p><p>All right. A woman wins gas money after she sues Honda. She spoke to us when she first filed this lawsuit. She said the car's manual promised her 50 miles per gallon. It didn't deliver. Can others cash in on her lawsuit?</p><p>BANFIELD: And <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>fresh off the big win, talks to CNN. Our Soledad O'Brien saying something along I'm not concerned about the very poor.</p><p>All right. Hold on. Was that all he said? Or has he been eviscerated unfairly? We are going to get to the bottom of context and why it matters.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: But up first here, a war of words over ending a war. Reaction is pouring in now after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that combat in Afghanistan will end next year.</p><p>This was on a plane to a NATO conference in Brussels. He told reporters, quote, \"Our goal is to complete all that transition in 2013 and then, hopefully, by mid- to the latter part of 2013, we will be able to make a transition from a combat role to a training, advise and assist role.\"</p><p>BANFIELD: But this is not highly unexpected during a campaign year. But the GOP front-runner at this point, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>came out blasting this announcement, saying the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>is giving our enemy an edge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Announced that, so the Taliban hears it. The Pakistanis hear it. The Afghani leaders hear it. Why in the world do you go to the people that you're fighting with and tell them the day you're pulling out your troops? It makes absolutely no sense. It's naivete. It's putting in jeopardy the mission of the United States of America and our commitments to freedom.</p><p>He is wrong. We need new leadership in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BANFIELD: From one politician to the other, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Buck McKeon, also had harsh some pretty words about that. We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>First, to Barbara Starr who's live at the Pentagon.</p><p>First question right out of the gate: everyone's asking, Barbara, is this just too soon?</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, perhaps a hard reality check is in order here, Ashleigh. NATO has said the Afghans have agreed -- all troops, all foreign troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. That is long agreed to. That is the reality. End of 2014.</p><p>So, what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is saying is there will be a transition period before that, training the Afghans, just like we saw in Iraq. So, you have to start that before you leave the country, don't you? He's saying, basically, in 2013, they will start wrapping up combat. They will shift to this training role and stick to the NATO plan of being out by 2014.</p><p>The question is whether the Afghans will be ready for all this.</p><p>BANFIELD: Exactly. And then why is it we're hearing the critics saying this is a year sooner than we expected, and even the chairman of the Armed Services Committee -- and I know you know how strong these kinds of remarks can be -- saying this: \"The committee has not seen a single assessment by our commanders that indicates they have any confidence in such a swift transition.\"</p><p>STARR: It's all -- you know, it's politics plus military policy, isn't it? You know, how unusual in Washington.</p><p>But, you know, you're seeing people select certain facts. The question is going to be this -- I mean, Governor Romney, still, what he says is what a lot of people are saying.</p><p>Will the Afghan forces be ready? Can they look after security in their country? Are you handing the Taliban a reason not to negotiate, not to come to the peace table and just wait it all out? Can you do something about those safe havens across the border in Pakistan in time?</p><p>All these are key questions. But the alternative would be for U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan in definitely after more than a decade of war. Everyone knows that that is not a sustainable option.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Barbara, thanks very much for that. I have so many more questions for you. I'll touch base with you at 6:00 on that.</p><p>And I also to let our audience know that we got a great guest coming up as well. Major General Spider Marks is going to join us. He is the former commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center. He'll weigh in, as well.</p><p>And then, at 8:00, Soledad's going to go further on this. She's going to talk to Wesley Clarke -- not only a general, but a former presidential candidate. Wow, so politics and the military. This should be a great interview Soledad is going to have, as well.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And it is 5:05. Minding your business now.</p><p>Stocks kicked off a new month with solid gains. The NASDAQ led the way, rising more than 1 percent, that's thanks to some strong earnings from the tech sector.</p><p>BANFIELD: And the big news might though have been Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook. You probably saw it, heard it.</p><p>The company finally did the filing. We were waiting and wondering yesterday was the day. Yesterday was the day.</p><p>Christine Romans, you were the first to tell us at 5:00 in the morning yesterday.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And status update on the IPO is that they're going to file for an IPO. Now, we know.</p><p>We have a look, as I was saying, under the hood of this company. And we know how much money it made. And what kind of revenue it had and where that was coming from.</p><p>Basically, this is how it stacks up with the rest of the big tech giants. I mean, it made about $1 billion of profit last year. You can see that makes it a bit smaller than the Microsofts the IBMs, the Googles of the world when you look in terms of its income. Its revenue was something like $3 billion, almost $4 billion in revenue -- 85 percent of that comes from advertising.</p><p>So, now, we know how that is the bulk of the money it makes. This company has a lot to prove. There's so much Facebook hype now about going public.</p><p>Now, this company has a lot to prove. It has to prove it can grow that $1 billion in profit to something that matches the other companies. And the valuation on Wall Street, people are so excited about this. They're going to value this company very, very big. Maybe even dwarf Hewlett-Packard. And it's got $1 billion.</p><p>So, it has a lot to prove. When it gets access to all of the investors and that cash, that's how it grows, right?</p><p>But now, Mark Zuckerberg's going to have to answer to hedge fund managers. And he'll have to answer to people who are investors in his company. And so, it will be interesting to see how the company might have to change and how things might have to change for us because of that.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, that's kind of the downside, right, because it's a cultural change for them.</p><p>ROMANS: It is. And, you know, along with these filings, Mark Zuckerberg sort of wrote a letter attached to these filings and he talked about sort of how could code wins arguments, the engineering, the hacker way at this company.</p><p>I mean, it is really a singular kind of culture there. And a lot of tech companies have this issue. And they become public. And it's like, don't change us because this is what has worked for us.</p><p>But also, I'll tell you something so interesting about the letter with Zuckerberg put with this IPO filing. I'll tell you, it's very humble. \"We often talk about inventions like the printing press and the television. Today, our society has reached another tipping point.\"</p><p>Ooh, the printing press and the television. So, Facebook has changed the world. Yes, it has. It has a $1 billion profit last year.</p><p>How is he going to drive that company so match that kind of language?</p><p>BANFIELD: That's 845 million active users on Facebook. And I heard a crazy thing yesterday. Tell me how crazy it is. One of these analysts said, you know, Zuckerberg might just come out and give every one of the users one share, just to be really different.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow.</p><p>BANFIELD: Weird.</p><p>ROMANS: Wouldn't that be interesting?</p><p>I keep thinking about the people. There's 3,200 employees who work there. Think of the people who work there who maybe took stock options early on instead of pay. I mean, remember Google and the massage therapist, there's Dell-lionaires in Austin, Texas, secretaries who took stock options in Dell years ago instead of being paid, because they didn't have cash.</p><p>I mean, so there could be people -- I mean, I think that's a heartwarming story. But for us, you were telling us about your son.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Yesterday we had this -- I was telling Ashleigh, too. We had this full conversation about Facebook and how can he get in on the action? He's 13 years old. My gosh, what an opportunity for kids, right?</p><p>Because this is something they know. And to them, this is a big deal. And they want -- how do you do that? How do you get them focused?</p><p>ROMANS: You don't want them to get in the stock if it didn't pan out the way everyone thinks it's going to. But that is a good question because you want kids to get involved in finance through things they know, like Facebook. So, I think I'm going to find an investment club in this neighborhood.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: That would be very cool.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: At 13 years old, he can turn into Ali Velshi. Ali Velshi was reading \"The Wall Street Journal\" at 13.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: There were go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANFIELD: My brother was doing fantasy stock book portfolios at the age of 12.</p><p>ROMANS: I love capitalists. I'm not one, but I love capitalists.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: If he turns out to be like Ali Velshi --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BANFIELD: I wonder what <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>was up to early in life.</p><p>ROMANS: I know, that's a good question.</p><p>BANFIELD: That's your next assignment. Thank you, Christine. Awesome.</p><p>I want to move on. Every morning at this time, we like to give you an EARLY START to your day by alerting you to the news that's not only just happening now. It's happening later. It's also developing now for the big story tonight.</p><p>In just a few hours, Attorney General Eric Holder is going to be grilled about the botched Fast and Furious gun tracking program.</p><p>Yesterday, Congressman Darrell Issa threatened to hold Holder in contempt, and then accused the Justice Department of a cover-up. In Fast and Furious, the agency just kind of lost track of over 1,000 different weapons that they were tracking after they were sold to so- called straw purchases. Some were covered from crime scenes, including one where a U.S. border was murdered.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: President Obama speaking at the national prayer breakfast this morning. We'll have his remarks for you live at 8:00 Eastern. Protesters are expected to be outside, including gay rights demonstrators and other groups who say the event is not inclusive enough.</p><p>BANFIELD: I was reading this thing in \"The New York Post\" this morning. Page six?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Ooh.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. A crazy story in Page Six about --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Waking up to TV tension.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes, that's it.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Was that the one?</p><p>BANFIELD: We talk about early reads. We read really early. And it just turned out, we were reading about yourselves.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Yes. And so, it says, \"A lack of chemistry is already plaguing CNN's new show, EARLY START, as it attempts to gain footing one month after launch. Hosts Ashleigh Banfield and Zoraida Sambolin,\" by the way, they have your picture in there, but not mine, \"had expressed frustration about the schizophrenic nature of the show, a source said. Another source said they just don't gel. Banfield says too much.\"</p><p>BANFIELD: You're talking too much right now.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: \"Sambolin doesn't say enough.\"</p><p>BANFIELD: You be quiet.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Apparently, I'm supposed to be telling you that.</p><p>BANFIELD: So, here's the deal -- why is it you never hear about the guys on ESPN having catfights?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Well, you never hear about that stuff.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: No, because it's more fun when you talk about girls having catfights, right? So, anyway. Love you, girl.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. We got to move on. We got a lot more news -- a lot more important things happening in the world than that. But thanks anyway, \"New York Post.\"</p><p>So, we got this most unbelievable scene that was developing in Egypt. Not what you think. This instead a soccer match in Port Said, Egypt. The fans rioted, hitting each other with rocks and chairs.</p><p>And if you thought riots got out of hand, this one has a death toll of 79 people.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Unbelievable.</p><p>BANFIELD: Hundreds of others injured in this riot.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, witnesses say police did very little to stop the violence. Authorities are investigating the cause of the riot now. Did it stem from sports rivalry? Or was it politically-motivated?</p><p>Three-day national mourning period is now being observed there.</p><p>Ben Wedeman live in Cairo for us.</p><p>Are you hearing about this being politically motivated?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as any, everything -- with everything in Egypt these days, there is a political element to it. Now, just to give you some background, it was the Cairo team called Al Ahli that had gone to this stadium in Port Said to play against the local team.</p><p>Now, the Al Ahli team is famous for its participation in the political clashes that have taken place in Egypt over the last year. In fact, in November and December, they were leading the clashes with the police.</p><p>So, many of the members of that club, of the hard-core fans of that club, are accusing the police of just standing by and allowing their rival, the rival team's fans, to go after them with, as we saw, everything -- rocks, bottles, sticks and in some cases, according to eyewitness accounts, firearms, as well.</p><p>Now, many people here in Cairo are blaming the military for simply not being able to maintain law and order -- not just at football games, but throughout the entire country.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Are they also being blamed for causing the tragedy? I read that somewhere.</p><p>WEDEMAN: Yes, there are members of Al Ahli team and their supporters who are saying exactly that. That this was the revenge of the security forces on the fans of the Al Ahli team because of their participation in those clashes. Obviously, we don't have evidence to suggest that.</p><p>But, certainly, now, we're hearing calls from leading politicians for the minister of the interior to be -- to resign and for people to go on trial for this massacre in Port Said.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Ben Wedeman -- live from Cairo -- thank you for that.</p><p>BANFIELD: It's 13 minutes past 5:00. We get a check on the top stories making news this hour.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Leon Panetta's announcement on Afghanistan, expected to make even more waves on the campaign trail today. It came on a plane without the president yesterday. The announcement that U.S. forces in Afghanistan are expected to end their combat role in 2013 and continue a training role through 2014.</p><p>BANFIELD: After taking a bit of hit, Planned Parenthood has now raised $400,000 in just 24 hours. How all of a sudden did all that money come in donations? Well, it follows an announcement from the Susan G. Komen Foundation that they were going to pull their funding from Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Komen is blaming the cuts of congressional investigation over Planned Parenthood abortion services. The founder is denying it had anything, though, to do with political pressure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY G. BRINKER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF SUSAN G. KOMEN: As we move forward, we will implement these new strategies which will allow us to serve even more women. We will never bow under political pressure. We will always stand firm to our goal to end breast cancer forever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BANFIELD: That is Nancy Brinker, who is the sister of Susan G. Komen. Nancy Brinker founded that foundation. She was a big contact with George W. Bush, as well. But this is a huge story.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. And a California woman has defeated Honda in small claims court. You'll remember Heather Peters of Los Angeles. She spoke to us after she filed a claim against the auto giant because their Honda Civic hybrid didn't come close to getting the promised 50 miles per gallon. She's been awarded nearly $10,000.</p><p>BANFIELD: And you probably didn't see it in the Northeast or the Northwest. But if you were in Texas or Oklahoma, what on earth was that streaking across the night sky in those states? Check out the video from the police dash cam.</p><p>You know, I was going to sing some crazy song. But, listen, it was a routine traffic stop that caught this. But the FAA is weighing in on what that is. It is a meteor. That's the fireball. It was an actual meteor.</p><p>The reports came as far south as Waco, Texas. And as far north as Oklahoma City of people saying, yikes!</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So much more fun to say it was a UFO.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Rob Marciano is in Atlanta with the national weather forecast. Did you see it, Rob?</p><p>ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST: No. But that's striking video. It looks more like a UFO than a fireball or meteor. But I'll take FAA's word on that.</p><p>Another picture from space, actually, the dark side of the moon. Check this out. Ebb and flow, a twin satellite project, a grail that's orbiting the moon that takes the side we don't see. This is the dark side, the elusive one. And, boy, you see just how many impact craters are on that, especially down across the south pole. That, my friends, is good stuff. Thank you, NASA.</p><p>All right. Also, good stuff, you probably enjoyed it in Trenton, New Jersey, yesterday -- 67 degrees. New York City, 64. Record-breaking heat. This is going away.</p><p>The temperatures today will still be a good 10 degrees or so above average. Seventy degrees in Atlanta, 52 degrees in Chicago, some rain across parts of the Delmarva. Still some cloud cover today, at least for the most part this morning across Pennsylvania.</p><p>It's February 2nd. You know what that means.</p><p>Fog across parts of the South, hit the low beams across I-10.</p><p>And then blizzards taking shape across the high plains. Storms coming out of the Colorado Rockies, 12-plus inches possible from Denver across Nebraska beginning later on today.</p><p>Guys, happy Groundhog Day. Back to you.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. That's when I said the Groundhog was going to be sweaty when he came out. That was going to indicate how the spring would be like.</p><p>MARCIANO: Oh, that's the new gauge.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes, instead of your shadow. And, by the way, I was waiting for the Pink Floyd reference on the dark side of the moon.</p><p>MARCIANO: Nice.</p><p>BANFIELD: I know you're old enough.</p><p>MARCIANO: Yes. Very much so.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I actually just found out how old he is.</p><p>BANFIELD: Can we say it, Rob?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I was shocked. Do you mind?</p><p>BANFIELD: You're 14.</p><p>MARCIANO: Thank you. There you go. I like it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Thank you, Rob Marciano.</p><p>Ahead on EARLY START: A story from American Airlines, looking to cut thousands of jobs. Here's the weird thing. Why is American Airlines saying, oh, no, no, this is going to save jobs? What's that going to mean for you, too, when you fly? We'll tell you.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And the Washington state senate passes the same sex marriage bill. Gay marriage is still not a done deal however. What happens next? You're going to find out in early read.</p><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Well, good morning to you, Milwaukee. It's 5:20, 32 degrees now. But later, it is going to be sunny and 44 degrees.</p><p>BANFIELD: Very nice. And in fact, Milwaukee's a good town to start with because we're doing our early reads for you. Getting a look at your local news that makes national headlines.</p><p>This morning, papers from Milwaukee, as well as Seattle. So, let's start in Milwaukee.</p><p>\"The Journal Sentinel\" is having this report in its newspaper. Five hundred fifty people are filing sex abuse claims against the Catholic archdiocese in Milwaukee. They are all part of a bankruptcy proceeding, and there was a timeline, a deadline on this. The archdiocese has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it's facing these civil fraud lawsuits over its handling of clergy sex abuse cases.</p><p>Those cases are sealed, so we can't say who these people are filing. But we had the stories before. And the archdiocese is requesting that a lot of the claims be thrown out.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Moving on to \"The Seattle Times.\" And we actually have a copy for you this morning. It reads, \"Historic vote clears the way for same-sex marriage.\"</p><p>Washington state senate passes the gay marriage bill. It's a big step on the path to legalize same-sex marriage there. The bill now heads to the House where it is expected to pass easily, they say. If it does, the governor says she is going to sign it.</p><p>Washington would be the seventh state to legalize same-sex marriage. So, you know, in addition to 26 lawmakers who previously announced their support, two more Republicans joined onboard, Senators Andy Hill and Joe Faine (ph). So, overall, 24 Democrats, four Republicans voted or the measure.</p><p>BANFIELD: Something says it could be a Supreme Court suit. They always end up in that route. But an interesting story now.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It's been a long, 10-year battle.</p><p>BANFIELD: Has it ever.</p><p>All right. So, another big story we're covering for you, some deep and painful cuts at American Airlines. It's not the story you want to hear when we're in an economy like this. But the parent company wants to eliminate 13,000 jobs from that company, remaking the nation's third-largest airline under bankruptcy protection. Unions, as you can expect, not particularly onboard with this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA GLADING, PRES., ASSN. OF PROF. FLIGHT ATTENDANTS: The term sheet they put down today is not where we're going to wind up. It was absolutely outrageous. It brought up issues and made proposals that were never discussed in our four years of bargaining. It was so far-reaching that even I, who was expecting a very, very outrageous proposal, was completely shocked.</p><p>TIM SMITH, AMERICAN AIRLINES SPOKESMAN: It's a difficult day for all of our employees -- no question about it -- from the senior management to every -- to the newest employee of the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BANFIELD: So, our CNN brand-new aviation and regulation correspondent, Lizzy O'Leary, is joining us now live from Washington.</p><p>So, Lizzy, let's just start right off the block by saying welcome.</p><p>LIZZY O'LEARY, CNN AVIATION AND REGULATION CORRESPONDENT: Thank you.</p><p>BANFIELD: And also, what kind of jobs are we talking about? Right across the board? Or things we need to be worried about.</p><p>O'LEARY: They are, across the board, though, they're a little deeper in some places than others. So, when you look at the overall numbers, 13,000, that's the big headline number that are proposed. And it's important to remember the airline has got the threat of the bankruptcy court behind them. So, you hear the union say those numbers are outrageous.</p><p>But there's a court proceeding here. That's why this sort of gets pushed so aggressively. So, we're talking about maybe 400 pilots, 2,000 flight attendants, mechanics, about 4,600. That certainly something that raises eyebrows with fliers.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes, I'm a flier. When I heard that number, is that safe? I mean, how are we supposed to digest that news as fliers?</p><p>O'LEARY: In two ways. Number one -- remember, these are union jobs. So, what is likely to happen when you look at the way other airline bankruptcies have happened, you're probably looking at taking some of those union jobs and shifting them to nonunion employees, or a slightly different workforce. It still means there are mechanics working on your plane, but maybe they weren't trained in the union shop. Maybe they have different hours.</p><p>It could also mean -- and this is something we're watching, where the work gets done. American used to do its work on all of its planes in-house. A lot of airlines don't do that anymore.</p><p>So, the question of does it get moved off-site. Who is watching that?</p><p>BANFIELD: Sure.</p><p>O'LEARY: Does it stay in the United States? That's another thing to keep an eye on. We don't know yet.</p><p>BANFIELD: The CEO said that, yes, this will be an end of a journey for a lot of people, meaning a lot of layoffs. But in the end, he says that it's going to preserve tens of thousands of jobs. And God, hope, yes, that's the case.</p><p>But in the end, what does it mean for everybody who doesn't have a job with that airline but flies and pays for tickets?</p><p>O'LEARY: Well, it's very soon to say what's going to happen overall right now. American is worried about your business. They would love your business. They've been advertising very cheap fares over the past day or two because they know that fliers are worried about that.</p><p>In the longer term -- yes, it probably means, as they get rid of some planes, planes are expensive, that the roots will be cut down. That could put pressure on ticket prices. But there are so other things that go into what makes up the ticket -- the taxes, what's the cost of oil. So, we don't know entirely yet. We'll be watching that for a while.</p><p>BANFIELD: Lizzy O'Leary, nice work and welcome again to the network. Good to have you.</p><p>O'LEARY: Thanks.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And ahead on EARLY START: <person><nameText>Mitt Romney's </nameText></person>Florida victory celebration didn't last very long. Can he recover from a comment that he made to our very own Soledad O'Brien?</p><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Welcome back to EARLY START. We're happy you're joining us this morning. I'm Zoraida Sambolin.</p><p>BANFIELD: Hi. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p>It is 29 minutes past the hour. Time to get you caught up on the stories making top headlines this morning.</p><p>The Republicans are blasting the defense secretary's announcement that the U.S. and NATO plan to end our combat mission in Afghanistan in the middle of next year. The administration says the time is right. But <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>says this jeopardizes the mission there and essentially give the enemy an edge.</p><p>SAMBOLIN (voice-over): And deadly violence following a soccer match in Egypt. Take a look at this. Nearly 80 people were killed and hundreds injured in a stampede by the fans. Authorities are investigating whether the rioting was triggered by sports rivalry or whether it was politically motivated. Egypt's military leaders have three days of national mourning now.</p><p>BANFIELD: And Florida state troopers are keeping a very close watch on smoke conditions. Smoke conditions that could force parts of I-95 to close because of low visibility. It is a targeted stretch between Statehood City and 407 in both directions. Important to say that because of this.</p><p>The authorities have been so cautious because of last weekend's chain reaction collisions on I-75 that killed 11 people. Those crashes were caused by extremely heavy smoke and fog from a nearby brush fire and a strange weather pattern that wouldn't allow that smoke to escape that particular valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMBOLIN (on-camera): We're really happy to hear that, right?</p><p>BANFIELD (on-camera): Yes.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: They're watching it very closely.</p><p>All right. Democrats and Republicans finally agree on something this morning. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really stepped in it. The GOP frontrunner stunned a lot of people yesterday. He wins Florida, then, he kills the victory buzz by saying this to CNN's Soledad O'Brien.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs to repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America. The 90, 95 percent of Americans who, right now, are struggling. And I'll continue to take that message across the nation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, pundits on the left and on the right are taking Romney to task. The frontrunner can't shake the out of touch rich guy image. So, let's talk to our political panel about this. Live from Washington, Shira Toeplitz, political reporter for the \"Roll Call,\" Democratic strategist, Penny Lee, joining us, and Jonathan Collegio, former press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p><p>Thank you for joining us this morning. All right. Shira, I'm going to start with you. Apparently, Romney has a history of making these unfortunate comments, is what I'm going to call them. Let's listen to some of them, and then, we'll talk about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMNEY: I like being able to fire people who provide services to me.</p><p>I'll tell you what, 10,000 bucks? $10,000 bet?</p><p>I know what it's like to worry whether you're going to get fired. There were couple of times I wonder whether I was going to get a pink slip.</p><p>I should also tell my story. I'm also unemployed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. So, we know a lot of these comments are taken out of context, but unfortunately, especially in some of these, there's always an economic undertone to them, which could be a big problem for him. He's now headed to Nevada, where there's a 12.6 unemployment rate. It's one of the highest in the nation. And, you know, these are gaffes he can't afford to have.</p><p>Economy is the number one issue. And 56 percent of Americans say that Romney is out of touch. The Tea Party, the conservative Tea Party, is now in play in Nevada. It wasn't the last time he was there. How does he recover from all of this as he's headed into the Nevada caucuses?</p><p>SHIRA TOEPLITZ, POLITICAL REPORTER, ROLL CALL: Well, he can do it two ways. He can sort of flood the zone and he can go out and give as many interviews as possible or he can start shying away from interviews with the news media to avoid these kinds of gaffes. The bad news for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>is he's made a habit of this as you just shown.</p><p>I mean, that reel of tape is basically an attack ad for Democrats that they can run over and over again this fall if he's the nominee. So, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>has two ways of dealing with this, but I do think that in the end, his advisers or people around him need to talk to him about this, because this is a problem with his candidacy and a long standing one.</p><p>You know, he's not the most articulate candidate we've seen on the campaign trail, and especially next to Barack Obama, who no matter what you think of his politics, he's a very eloquent man. That's going to be a big difference this fall if he doesn't work out the Kingston (ph), his personalities of political candidate. SAMBOLIN: So, Jonathan, speaking of attack ads, part of the reason that Romney is view as so out of touch is because of the Super PAC ads about Bain Capital. Those are super effective, and you're communications director for one of the most influential, and that's American Crossroads. It's advised by Karl Rove.</p><p>And some are saying that the Super PACs are contributing to the most negative campaign ever. The exit polls in Florida actually show that 71 percent of voters said that the ads were, indeed, a factor in their vote. Are Super PACs contributing to shaping all of these negative messages that we are constantly seeing?</p><p>JONATHAN COLLEGIO, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS, AMERICAN CROSSROADS: One of the interesting things about Super PACs is that they are really part and parcel of the campaign finance reform efforts of ten years ago. If you remember back in 2002 when Congress passed that McCain-Feingold legislation that was supposed to really limit the influence of political parties, much of that money went to outside organizations on the left and the right.</p><p>Remember that the left, really, was the ice breaker and the spearhead of outside groups in 2004 with moveon.org and Americans coming together and all of these groups that tried to defeat George W. Bush in 2004.</p><p>The other thing that the campaign laws do was that because outside groups cannot coordinate with candidates, it makes it very, very difficult for outside groups to run positive ads, because we can't coordinate to get footage of a candidate to put into an ad in a positive way.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, you're saying you have no choice?</p><p>COLLEGIO: No. What I'm saying is at the end of the day, you end up with a situation where it's much easier to get the negative footage like you showed on the earlier segment and to turn that into an ad, because then, there's undoubtedly no coordination with whoever you're hitting.</p><p>So, in a weird way, it's the result of the campaign finance reformers that we have all of the outside groups operating today.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right, Penny. Let's stay on the Super PACs. Six Democratic Super PACs reported fund-raising of just over $19 million. It's significantly less than Jonathan's Super PAC hall which was $51 million, and maybe, not as concerning for President Obama who ended the year with $81.8 million in the bank, but the house races are in contention, as well.</p><p>The Tea Party as well as Jonathan's Super PAC have a lot of Democrats in their sight. If we're talking about Super PACs shaping the election, are you concerned that the Democrats aren't able to get as much money or the same amount of money as the Republicans?</p><p>PENNY LEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: There's always concern. I mean, when you have someone like <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>going out there in a state like Florida, you know, carpet-bombing a candidate for him to be able to win, that's how what he did to Newt Gingrich. I mean, we're all concerned that we're going to have that same effect on House races, on Senate races.</p><p>But I got to tell you, a lot of it also backfires. I mean, you saw <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>even though it was a highly negative ad, his own negatives went up. Now, he has independents, 50 percent of independents now question whether or not they like him. And you also have three to five Republicans now that are saying, wait a second, I don't think we want who we have right now for our nominee.</p><p>So, these ads are effective. We are concerned about them. But, also know that they also have a double-edged sword to them. So, you know, we will run a positive campaign. We will have the necessary money to be competitive. How it all shapes up will be very interesting.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Shira, Jonathan, and Penny, thank you for joining us this morning.</p><p>COLLEGIO: Thank you.</p><p>BANFIELD: And keep it right here on CNN for the best political coverage on television at seven o'clock eastern on \"Starting Point.\" Soledad is going to have an interview with Mark McKinnon. He's a former adviser to President George W. bush and Senator John McCain. Soledad is going to ask him how he would advice <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>right now.</p><p>We have plenty coming up, so make sure you keep it right here at 5:37. We're back right after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BANFIELD (voice-over): Wow. Love, peace, and soul. Remembering Don Cornelius, the oh so cool creator and host of \"Soul Train.\" Cornelius was found shot dead yesterday in an apparent suicide at the age of 75.</p><p>SAMBOLIN (voice-over): And Cornelius was the genius behind one of the longest-running syndicated shows in television history, folks, 1971 to 2006. \"Soul Train\" brought the music of Black America to the entire world, catapulting the likes of James Brown, Aretha Franklin, The Jackson 5, public enemy, you name it, right? His hand was there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN (on-camera): Christopher John Farley, an editor for \"The Wall Street Journal\" is joining us this morning. I got to tell you, on \"USA Today,\" on the cover story, it says, \"Soul Train laid the rails of a cultural revolution, and Don Cornelius was the hip trip's engineer.\"</p><p>I think it can't be stated better than that. We were in a meeting yesterday when we found out about this. We were totally shocked, and that to find out that it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What do we know about that?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY, SPEAKEASY EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, we do know that he had some health problems, that he had gone through some bitterly contested divorce from a second wife, but we don't know much more than that. I'm sure more will come out in the coming days. I think the focus right now, really, is more on his legacy.</p><p>What we do know -- because what we do know that is \"Soul Train\" is a very important show, not only for Black America, but for White America, really for all Americans. To bring soul music straight to your home. I mean, this show started before YouTube, before Twitter, before all these other ways we have of sharing what's going on with music and fashion and dance.</p><p>And it took these things that people might not have gotten to see in their hometowns, and they got to see the latest moves, the latest dance moves. The artists that they only heard under boom boxes or their walkmans. They finally got to see them in their homes and got to experience what other people were getting to see in the big city.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Yes. I read somewhere before MTV, there was \"Soul Train.\" And you wrote on a website here, you said that you were a kid in Suburbia, watching \"Soul Train,\" and that show was actually perfect for suburbia. Could you explain that?</p><p>FARLEY: Yes, I think a lot of times, because of \"Soul Train\" focused on urban music. OK. This is really for big city kids, but no, it was for everyone, especially for people who didn't get to have these kinds of acts come to their hometowns. I grew up in Bradford, New York, a small town outside of Rochester, New York, and we didn't get to see the Aretha Franklin and the Stevie Wonder come to our town to perform.</p><p>I mean, it was a college town. Sometimes, they did come to visit for luxurious, but they weren't there to perform for big stadiums, but we did get to see them on \"Soul Train.\" And that was very important, I think, for a lot of people who love great music.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Yes. And you know, it was the first day of Black History Month, which I consider very ironic, as well. Are we hearing anything about tributes planned from, you know, all of these greats where he helped launch their careers?</p><p>FARLEY: Well, tributes already flooding in on the wet, the quest love, the drummer for the roots, and the house band for late night with Jimmy Fallon. He's written a very passionate, very interesting (ph) tribute about how much Don Cornelius meant to him, especially from the business standpoint. This is a guy who show featured a lot of commercials for Black products.</p><p>It was a nationally syndicated show, and he owned the show. And that was something that was really pioneering for someone of that time to actually own their own show, to have it nationally syndicated and be a Blacked-own show. It really paved the way for a lot of music moguls today. Again, not just for Black music moguls, but also for White ones, as well.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Yes. Definitely a pioneer there. Christopher John Farley, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>FARLEY: Thank you.</p><p>BANFIELD: Forty-four minutes past the hour. Time to get you caught up on the top stories of the morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BANFIELD (voice-over): Republicans blasting the defense secretary's announcement that the U.S. and NATO plan to end the combat mission in Afghanistan by the middle of next year. For his part, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>on the stump, saying this jeopardizes the mission there and essentially gives the enemy an edge. Leon Panetta did also say that an early transition to a training role does not necessarily mean that the U.S. is pulling out early.</p><p>SAMBOLIN (voice-over): Legendary boxing trainer, Angelo Dundee, has died. The Hall of Famer was best known for guiding Muhammad Ali to glory and was also in the corner of welterweight great, Sugar Ray Leonard. Dundee was 90 years old.</p><p>BANFIELD: And big rigs may be about to get a whole lot bigger. Proposed federal transportation bill would allow heavier and longer trucks on our nation's highways. House Republicans are behind this. They like the idea, but the congressional critics are a bit worried about safety here. One of the democrats saying, quote, \"If there was ever a prescription for disaster, this is it.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMBOLIN (on-camera): Bigger isn't always better, right?</p><p>BANFIELD (on-camera): But wait for it. It's certainly going to be a healthy debate on that issue.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Still ahead, the Texas teenager mistakenly deported is back home with her family. There are still lots of questions about how and why she was sent to Colombia. You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It is 5:48 in the east. Welcome back to EARLY START. So, this is a shocking story. Remember the American teenager mistakenly deported to Colombia? The 15-year-old Jakadrien Turner is back home in Texas. So, exactly what happened to her is still something of an international mystery.</p><p>BANFIELD: That really is. And CNN's Ed Lavandera has been getting to the bottom of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, this is your room?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Is it like how you remember it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. It's everything.</p><p>LAVANDERA (on-camera): More than a year ago, Jakadrien Turner ran away from home. She's back with her family, and we're trying to unravel the story of how this American citizen, with the name of Tika Cortez, was deported to Colombia. This name, Tika Lanayene Cortez, where did that come from?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was a name she made up.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Tika Cortez was Jakadrien's new street name. Her family says she was lord (ph) to Houston and forced into prostitution. She was scared and trying to get away when she stole clothes to pay for a bus ticket home. But the family suspects mall employees knew her as Tika and gave police the name. But Jakadrien's family insists the teenager never tried to fool law enforcement agents.</p><p>RAY JACKSON, TURNER FAMILY ATTORNEY: They didn't believe her. They told her to shut up and keep her mouth closed.</p><p>LAVANDERA: How many officers did she try to tell I'm Jakadrien Turner, I'm not Tika Cortez?</p><p>JACKSON: At least three.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Immigration officer?</p><p>JACKSON: Immigration officers.</p><p>LAVANDERA: And how many of the Houston police officers?</p><p>JACKSON: She never told the Houston police officers that she was a U.S. citizen, so that never came up.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Jakadrien's family says the judge asked where do you want to be deported to. Jakadrien said Puerto Rico. And when she was told Colombia, she thought it was Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>JACKSON: When she was with immigration, not only did they tell her that she was from Colombia, they told her who her mother was. They told her where she was born in Colombia, at what point she came to United States.</p><p>LAVANDERA (on-camera): Immigration and customs enforcement officials say the Turner family's accusations are absolutely false. ICE says its found no evidence that Jakadrien tried to give its officers her real name or to claim that she was a U.S. citizen. ICE also denies that the name Tika Cortez matched the name of a Colombian citizen scheduled to be deported.</p><p>And on top of all that, a law enforcement source tells CNN that there are jailhouse recordings of Jakadrien telling officers that she is Tika Cortez from Colombia.</p><p>ICE agents have been saying that she was the one that from the beginning told them that she was Tika Cortez from Colombia. Are you saying that's not the case at all?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's not the case.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): It took less than two months for Jakadrien Turner to get deported and put on the streets of Colombia.</p><p>Can you talk to yourself Spanish while you were there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I talk (ph) some Spanish. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LAVANDERA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Si.</p><p>LAVANDERA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Muy bien.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Jakadrien Turner is now three months pregnant and the fight over how she was deported will likely be settled in court.</p><p>Ed Lavandera, CNN, Dallas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BANFIELD: Excellent.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Her accent was very good. Yes. I thought.</p><p>BANFIELD: She had learned all of the Spanish while she was there.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: That's what she said. She learned it while she was there.</p><p>BANFIELD: That's amazing. It's still a very mysterious story.</p><p>Coming up at 7:30 on Soledad's \"STARTING POINT,\" she's going to actually speak with Jakadrien Turner along with her mother. We'll find out a little bit more about that and their attorney will be them as well, and we will be back right after this.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I got that feeling.</p><p>BANFIELD: Tonight's going to be a good night? I hope it's going to be a good day. I love it. You know what you're looking at? In Pennsylvania.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BANFIELD: This is gobbler's knob.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Look at all the people out there. My goodness!</p><p>BANFIELD: At 5:55 in the morning on the east coast, this many people turn out for the celebration at Gobblers Knob, because every year at this time, this is where Punxsutawney Phil --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: His big day, his dig debut.</p><p>BANFIELD: Oh, I love it. I want to know who that is singing. I thought that was our producer in my ear.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It does kind of sound like him, right? Will he see his shadow? Big question.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: We're going to monitor the details there and bring them to you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BANFIELD: Punxsutawney Phil</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It's been a very mild, mild winter. No complaints, right?</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, we're keeping you in pop culture loop this morning by taking a looking at what's trending on the web and on social media.</p><p>BANFIELD: Or as I like to call it, the interwebs.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: The interwebs.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. This is great. This interwebs story comes from \"The Huffington Post.\" Are you ready for this? A guy by the name of John Goodman, not the actor, but he could be because this is a really funny story. That's John Goodman and his girlfriend. He is 48 years old. And she is 46.</p><p>Why do I say that? Because he's trying to adopt her. You did not hear on (ph). He's trying to adopt his girlfriend so that he can, somehow, manipulate getting out of -- paying out of assets in a wrongful death suit. Can you believe? This is the way he's trying to make sure that he can try to protect his assets by adopting his long- time girlfriend.</p><p>If he does it, if he is actually able to go through with the adoption, legally, she's entitled to part of his trust. Apparently, there's a court, another court, that's trying to overturn this adoption.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And what happened? Do we have anything on the wrongful death? BANFIELD: Well, the wrongful death, I believe, was a car accident. He ran a stop sign back in 2010. And, it was a serious incident. There was a person who died. And of course, the family of that person who died launched the wrongful death --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And he's trying to get away with not paying anything.</p><p>BANFIELD: He wants to get away with not paying on his assets by, you know, trusting them to the girlfriend, but again, he's 48, she's 42, and he is trying to adopt her.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Coming up on six o'clock here, still to come on EARLY START, the U.S. to end combat operations in Afghanistan next year. This big announcement draws big criticism. James Spider Marks, former commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center weighs in.

The acquisition is an ambitious step by Google to expand the company's footprint into wearables and health apps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the deal comes amid mounting scrutiny into the tech giant's market power and growing fears about Big Tech's collection of health data from consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google announced the deal on Friday, and in the days since a number of consumer and privacy groups, as well as lawmakers from across the aisle, have already been pressing regulators to take a closer look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, said the deal threatens \"to further entrench [Google's] market power online.\"</p><p>\"This proposed transaction is a major test of antitrust enforcers' will and ability to enforce the law and halt anti-competitive concentrations of economic power. It deserves an immediate and thorough investigation,\" Cicilline said Friday.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a fierce critic of Silicon Valley, questioned whether Google should even be allowed to go through with the deal while it is already under scrutiny.</p><p>\"Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they're under DOJ [Department of Justice] antitrust investigation,\" Hawley tweeted Friday, shortly after the deal was announced.</p><p>Outside groups are also pressing for regulators to step in, with a coalition led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) outright urging them to nix the deal.</p><p>\"There are several important reasons [to block the deal],\" EPIC President Marc Rotenberg told The Hill on Monday. \"This is obviously sensitive data.\"</p><p>\"The second is that Google's previous representations about safeguarding user data after acquisitions are commitments they don't keep. The third is that both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission ... have indicated that it's important to closely scrutinize mergers in the tech industry,\" he continued.</p><p>Google's deal comes with the company, and the tech industry at large, facing intense criticism from Washington over a host of issues from privacy to market power to allegations of online bias.</p><p>The Justice Department, a coalition of state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee have all launched investigations into digital marketplace competition with Google an important target of those probes. The plans to buy Fitbit are certain to intensify those concerns.</p><p>The deal is important for both companies as they compete in a growing consumer segment. Google has not had a significant presence in wearables compared to other companies, and Fitbit's own position has reportedly weakened in recent years with Apple and two Chinese players taking a more dominant share.</p><p>The two companies though are pushing back on critics, noting that the deal hinges on approval from both shareholders and regulators.</p><p>\"The transaction is expected to close in 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Fitbit's stockholders and regulatory approvals,\" the companies said in their announcement.</p><p>There is a debate over how regulators are likely to approach the deal.</p><p>\"The companies are really in different areas,\" Joel Mitnick, a partner in the antitrust division of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP and a former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawyer, told The Hill. \"Fitbit has wearable fitness technology; Google doesn't. You would look at this ordinarily as a complementary product merger.\"</p><p>Google has developed a health app called Wear OS, but the tech giant has largely struggled to break into the wearables market.</p><p>But others say the deal goes to the heart of tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>Daniel Hanley, a policy analyst at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that has long challenged Silicon Valley, said larger companies often wait for a competitor to arise, so they can just acquire the company and its technology.</p><p>\"They don't have to do any investment, they don't have to do anything except acquire,\" Hanley continued. \"Considering the kinds of acquisitions Google has done ... they don't enter these markets because they wait for a winner.\"</p><p>An equally pressing concern for critics is the vast amount of health data Google would acquire in the deal. Since its founding in 2007, Fitbit products have been tracking data about consumers' health habits and more \u00af and the company now claims to have 28 million active users.</p><p>\"This is the acquisition of a just a massive trove of data,\" Emily Peterson-Cassin, a digital rights policy expert at Public Citizen, told The Hill.</p><p>\"The potential of having sensitive health data from people is so exploitable that almost anything that they do with it is deeply concerning,\" Peterson-Cassin added. \"This is data that has a lot of potential but also carries immense risk.\"</p><p>The deal also comes as Congress grapples with drafting a federal privacy law. Lawmakers have also been paying closer attention to safeguarding medical data after recent breaches.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told The Hill that the company is committed to honoring previous data privacy agreements from Fitbit and will be transparent about what data is collected with the devices. Data collected by the apps will not be used for ad targeting, and users will be able to review and delete their data, according to Google.</p><p>But privacy advocates worry that Google's promises are not as ironclad as they sound and that the company will eventually swallow Fitbit's consumer health data as well.</p><p>\"Right now, all we're getting from Google and Fitbit are empty promises,\" Hanley said. \"Tech companies are ruthless when it comes to integrating data.\"</p><p>Having that data could also give Google an edge against other competitors, critics say.</p><p>\"There are a lot of questions surrounding what it means when you are collecting that much data,\" Peterson-Cassin continued. \"Not only what does it mean for an incipient competitor, but also how do you enter the market when all the data is going in one place already?\"</p><p>Google has bought companies \u00af and their data \u00af before, most notably when it acquired Nest Labs, which made digital home products, in 2014. Google eventually folded Nest into its own hardware division and privacy policies.</p><p>But critics note that questions about how companies handle consumer data have grown since then, particularly after a number of privacy controversies.</p><p>Rotenberg, from EPIC, expressed optimism that opponents can stop Google from going forward.</p><p>\"We think they will move to block the deal and we want to encourage them to take that step,\" he said of regulators.</p><p>But both Hanley and Mitnick said it is more likely the deal goes through.</p><p>\"I personally don't think anything will happen,\" Hanley told The Hill about regulators stepping in.</p><p>\"History has shown that the FTC and DOJ have been very permissive of these companies, they just let them run wild.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y51-C821-JCB9-404K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1149\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

Sensors would capture data on park bench usage, air quality and more, aimed at making the neighborhood more livable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was handshakes and smiles all around when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials from Sidewalk Labs gathered here 18 months ago to announce the data-driven city of tomorrow. But internal discord and public criticism are threatening the project.</p><p>\"I don't think they look so happy now,\" said Paula Fletcher, a Toronto City Council member. \"This big idea isn't going exactly the way it was planned.\"</p><p>As in New York, where fierce opposition to Amazon led the online retail giant to cancel plans to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, a local movement here is growing to send Sidewalk Labs packing. The concerns: money, privacy and whether Toronto is handing too much power over civic life to a for-profit American technology giant.</p><p>The #BlockSidewalk campaign formed in February after the Toronto Star reported on leaked documents indicating that Sidewalk Labs was considering paying for transit and infrastructure on a larger portion of the waterfront. In return, it would seek a cut of the property taxes, development fees and the increased value of the land resulting from the development - an estimated $6 billion over 30 years.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, said the reason it had not shared the proposal was that it was still being debated. But it was a tough look for a company that has come under fire over a lack of transparency around its business model and over the question of who would own and govern the data and intellectual property at the heart of its proposal.</p><p>\"It's our job to remind everybody that no is an option and that consent is important,\" said Bianca Wylie, one of the leaders of #BlockSidewalk. \"The way this process has been set up was not a question of whether we should do stuff like this, but how.\"</p><p>Separately, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing the city, provincial and federal governments to shut down the project over privacy concerns. Michael Bryant, the head of the group, said Trudeau had been \"seduced by the honey pot of Google's sparkling brand and promises of political and economic glory.\"</p><p>In the original \"vision document\" for Quayside, Sidewalk Labs described adaptive traffic lights that would detect when pedestrians and cyclists were at a light to ensure that they had priority to cross. Sensors would detect when benches needed to be repaired, when waste bins needed to be emptied and when bicycle lanes should be transformed into pedestrian walkways, or vice versa.</p><p>The vision document also mentioned \"health sensors\" but did not elaborate. A digital identification system would enable residents and workers to access services.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs committed $50 million to conducting year-long public consultations and creating a master plan to be submitted to Waterfront Toronto, a corporation that represents the three levels of government in developing the area. The plan would require the approval of the corporation and several government bodies to advance.</p><p>The plan is expected by the end of June - more than six months behind schedule.</p><p>The company has acknowledged missteps.</p><p>Micah Lasher, the head of policy and communications for Sidewalk Labs, said providing more details about the business model for Quayside and plans for data governance earlier would have helped allay many concerns. But he also said the business model remains uncertain.</p><p>Lasher said the company has struggled to figure out when to unveil ideas to the public.</p><p>\"If you share them too early, they seem half-baked and you might move away from them later,\" he said. \"If you share them too late, you are subject to criticism for not being transparent.\"</p><p>Long before the #BlockSidewalk movement and the civil liberties lawsuit, controversies had already provoked public skepticism.</p><p>Some of the  disillusionment stemmed from the flurry of coverage about how tech firms, Google included, handle their customers' personal data.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs has downplayed links to its corporate sibling, saying it will not monetize the data it collects and proposing that it be governed by a data trust that would set the rules around its use.</p><p>Andrew Clement, a professor emeritus in the University of Toronto's faculty of information studies and member of a Waterfront Toronto advisory panel, said questions remain about the trust. Instead of answering them, he added, Sidewalk has been distracting people with new prototypes, such as raincoats for buildings.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs were both rocked by several high-profile resignations and dismissals last year. Ontario's former privacy commissioner resigned from a paid consulting role with Sidewalk because she said its plans for the data trust fell short of her standards.</p><p>Then, in December, Ontario's auditor general found that Waterfront Toronto gave Sidewalk Labs more information before a request for proposals than other companies that would be responding to the request.</p><p>According to the auditor general, Waterfront Toronto said it shared information with Sidewalk Labs as part of its regular \"market sounding process\" to gauge interest in the project, also shared it with some other groups and would have given it to any that asked. Waterfront Toronto said the information did not give potential bidders an unfair advantage.</p><p>The auditor general said that \"fair practice and equal treatment would suggest that all potential bidders receive the same information at the same time\" and called for greater government oversight.</p><p>Wylie, the #BlockSidewalk leader, said cities are relinquishing too much power to big tech companies as regulators are trying to rein them in.</p><p>But some worry that showing Alphabet the door would stain the tech-friendly image Trudeau has tried to cultivate for Canada.</p><p>\"We believe that tearing up this process midstream poses reputational risks, trade risks and legal risks,\" Brian Kelcey, vice president of public affairs for the Toronto Region Board of Trade, told a parliamentary committee last month.</p><p>Kristina Verner, Waterfront Toronto's vice president of innovation, sustainability and prosperity, said that \"the potential of this project is still very exciting.\" She said she does not see any harm in waiting to see Sidewalk's final plan.</p><p>\"It is definitely not a done deal,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:foreign@washpost.com\">foreign@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-e0785500-6d12-11e9-bbe7-1c798fb80536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2Y-0CP1-JBFW-C03R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1106\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sensors would capture data on park bench usage, air quality and more, aimed at making the neighborhood more livable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was handshakes and smiles all around when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials from Sidewalk Labs gathered here 18 months ago to announce the data-driven city of tomorrow. But internal discord and public criticism are threatening the project.</p><p>\"I don't think they look so happy now,\" said Paula Fletcher, a Toronto City Council member. \"This big idea isn't going exactly the way it was planned.\"</p><p>As in New York, where fierce opposition to Amazon led the online retail giant to cancel plans to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, a local movement here is growing to send Sidewalk Labs packing. The concerns: money, privacy and whether Toronto is handing too much power over civic life to a for-profit American technology giant.</p><p>The #BlockSidewalk campaign formed in February after the Toronto Star reported on leaked documents indicating that Sidewalk Labs was considering paying for transit and infrastructure on a larger portion of the waterfront. In return, it would seek a cut of the property taxes, development fees and the increased value of the land resulting from the development - an estimated $6 billion over 30 years.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, said the reason it had not shared the proposal was that it was still being debated. But it was a tough look for a company that has come under fire over a lack of transparency around its business model and over the question of who would own and govern the data and intellectual property at the heart of its proposal.</p><p>\"It's our job to remind everybody that no is an option and that consent is important,\" said Bianca Wylie, one of the leaders of #BlockSidewalk. \"The way this process has been set up was not a question of whether we should do stuff like this, but how.\"</p><p>Separately, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing the city, provincial and federal governments to shut down the project over privacy concerns. Michael Bryant, the head of the group, said Trudeau had been \"seduced by the honey pot of Google's sparkling brand and promises of political and economic glory.\"</p><p>In the original \"vision document\" for Quayside, Sidewalk Labs described adaptive traffic lights that would detect when pedestrians and cyclists were at a light to ensure that they had priority to cross. Sensors would detect when benches needed to be repaired, when waste bins needed to be emptied and when bicycle lanes should be transformed into pedestrian walkways, or vice versa.</p><p>The vision document also mentioned \"health sensors\" but did not elaborate. A digital identification system would enable residents and workers to access services.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs committed $50 million to conducting year-long public consultations and creating a master plan to be submitted to Waterfront Toronto, a corporation that represents the three levels of government in developing the area. The plan would require the approval of the corporation and several government bodies to advance.</p><p>The plan is expected by the end of June - more than six months behind schedule.</p><p>The company has acknowledged missteps.</p><p>Micah Lasher, the head of policy and communications for Sidewalk Labs, said providing more details about the business model for Quayside and plans for data governance earlier would have helped allay many concerns. But he also said the business model remains uncertain.</p><p>Lasher said the company has struggled to figure out when to unveil ideas to the public.</p><p>\"If you share them too early, they seem half-baked and you might move away from them later,\" he said. \"If you share them too late, you are subject to criticism for not being transparent.\"</p><p>Long before the #BlockSidewalk movement and the civil liberties lawsuit, controversies had already provoked public skepticism.</p><p>Some of the  disillusionment stemmed from the flurry of coverage about how tech firms, Google included, handle their customers' personal data.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs has downplayed links to its corporate sibling, saying it will not monetize the data it collects and proposing that it be governed by a data trust that would set the rules around its use.</p><p>Andrew Clement, a professor emeritus in the University of Toronto's faculty of information studies and member of a Waterfront Toronto advisory panel, said questions remain about the trust. Instead of answering them, he added, Sidewalk has been distracting people with new prototypes, such as raincoats for buildings.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs were both rocked by several high-profile resignations and dismissals last year. Ontario's former privacy commissioner resigned from a paid consulting role with Sidewalk because she said its plans for the data trust fell short of her standards.</p><p>Then, in December, Ontario's auditor general found that Waterfront Toronto gave Sidewalk Labs more information before a request for proposals than other companies that would be responding to the request.</p><p>According to the auditor general, Waterfront Toronto said it shared information with Sidewalk Labs as part of its regular \"market sounding process\" to gauge interest in the project, also shared it with some other groups and would have given it to any that asked. Waterfront Toronto said the information did not give potential bidders an unfair advantage.</p><p>The auditor general said that \"fair practice and equal treatment would suggest that all potential bidders receive the same information at the same time\" and called for greater government oversight.</p><p>Wylie, the #BlockSidewalk leader, said cities are relinquishing too much power to big tech companies as regulators are trying to rein them in.</p><p>But some worry that showing Alphabet the door would stain the tech-friendly image Trudeau has tried to cultivate for Canada.</p><p>\"We believe that tearing up this process midstream poses reputational risks, trade risks and legal risks,\" Brian Kelcey, vice president of public affairs for the Toronto Region Board of Trade, told a parliamentary committee last month.</p><p>Kristina Verner, Waterfront Toronto's vice president of innovation, sustainability and prosperity, said that \"the potential of this project is still very exciting.\" She said she does not see any harm in waiting to see Sidewalk's final plan.</p><p>\"It is definitely not a done deal,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:foreign@washpost.com\">foreign@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-e07855006d1211e9bbe71c798fb80536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-VCC1-DYX1-H03R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><timeReceived>11:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The crushing departures occurred just days before the Libra Association formalized its structure in Geneva on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several Trump administration officials and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned with Facebook's immense market power and global reach. The project also raised alarms among financial regulators, who urged the company to tread carefully or risk a federal crackdown.</p><p>While Libra's founders insist they will wait for Washington's green light before launching, the company's critics are pouncing to stop the project in its tracks.</p><p>\"Facebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolizing our economic infrastructure,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"I trust others will see the wisdom of avoiding this ill-conceived undertaking.\"</p><p>The forces behind Libra have battled intense scrutiny from Washington since Facebook in June announced its plans to launch the project by 2020. The payments system would allow users to send and receive money transmitted through a proprietary cryptocurrency called Libra, which could be stored along with other virtual currencies like bitcoin.</p><p>The Libra Association is legally separate from Facebook, which is but one of the close to 180 businesses backing the project. Even so, the social media company's deep involvement with Libra has raised alarms among lawmakers who warn Facebook can't be trusted in the financial services sector.</p><p>\"I'm concerned Facebook is aiming to shield itself from financial oversight by US regulators, which would explain their establishing a charter in Switzerland instead of Silicon Valley,\" Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas), a member of the House Financial Services Committee who recently joined a congressional trip to Switzerland to discuss Libra with regulators, said in a statement to The Hill.</p><p>Facebook's reputation has soured in Congress after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw a right-leaning public relations firm obtain data on hundreds of millions of Facebook users without their consent or knowledge. Lawmakers grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the privacy breach over multiple fiery hearings last year and have since battered the company over concerns that it has amassed too much control over the lives of Americans and allowed foreign entities to manipulate Facebook's platform to sow discord during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook, which has more than 2 billion monthly users worldwide, is facing antitrust investigations from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and key lawmakers in the House, a threat that has rattled the company.</p><p>Daniel Ives, an analyst and managing director with the investment firm Wedbush, described the company as \"the center of the beltway firestorm\" over Big Tech.</p><p>Facebook seems to be signaling that its executives are not intimidated by federal investigations into its market power and that it intends to push ahead.</p><p>Just after consumer group Public Citizen this week accused Facebook of seeking to \"entrench [itself] as an unparalleled global monopolist,\" the Libra Association signed up its first 21 member organizations.</p><p>\"Facebook is trying to send a signal that they're not going to back down and they're going to go on the offensive,\" Ives said.</p><p>Facebook has sought to distance Libra from its poisonous reputation, highlighting the other partners in the project. But Facebook's missteps have left the company with little credibility among politicians and K Street insiders.</p><p>\"That's bullshit. I don't think anybody buys that at all,\" said a financial technology industry lobbyist. \"As much as Facebook wants to say that this isn't a Facebook program, they're putting their CEO up to answer for it.\"</p><p>The Libra project faces a crucial test next week when Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. He'll likely face a slew of pointed questions about the project and must satisfy the numerous regulatory concerns posed by Libra's massive reach and complicated structure.</p><p>Lawmakers pressed David Marcus, head of Libra, at a prior hearing for answers about how the project would comply with the complex web of banking, illicit finance, securities and money transferring regulations likely applicable to Libra.</p><p>In a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) over the summer, Marcus insisted, \"We want, and need, governments, central banks, regulators, non-profits, and other stakeholders at the table and value all of the feedback we have received.\"</p><p>While Marcus vowed to satisfy all concerns raised by regulators, lawmakers fumed as he offered little insight into how Libra could be supervised by the federal government.</p><p>\"There's a reason we've seen nearly every household name involved with Libra pull out of the project \u00af the risks are not worth the rewards,\" Rep.

The crushing departures occurred just days before the Libra Association formalized its structure in Geneva on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several Trump administration officials and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned with Facebook's immense market power and global reach. The project also raised alarms among financial regulators, who urged the company to tread carefully or risk a federal crackdown.</p><p>While Libra's founders insist they will wait for Washington's green light before launching, the company's critics are pouncing to stop the project in its tracks.</p><p>\"Facebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolizing our economic infrastructure,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"I trust others will see the wisdom of avoiding this ill-conceived undertaking.\"</p><p>The forces behind Libra have battled intense scrutiny from Washington since Facebook in June announced its plans to launch the project by 2020. The payments system would allow users to send and receive money transmitted through a proprietary cryptocurrency called Libra, which could be stored along with other virtual currencies like bitcoin.</p><p>The Libra Association is legally separate from Facebook, which is but one of the close to 180 businesses backing the project. Even so, the social media company's deep involvement with Libra has raised alarms among lawmakers who warn Facebook can't be trusted in the financial services sector.</p><p>\"I'm concerned Facebook is aiming to shield itself from financial oversight by US regulators, which would explain their establishing a charter in Switzerland instead of Silicon Valley,\" Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas), a member of the House Financial Services Committee who recently joined a congressional trip to Switzerland to discuss Libra with regulators, said in a statement to The Hill.</p><p>Facebook's reputation has soured in Congress after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw a right-leaning public relations firm obtain data on hundreds of millions of Facebook users without their consent or knowledge. Lawmakers grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the privacy breach over multiple fiery hearings last year and have since battered the company over concerns that it has amassed too much control over the lives of Americans and allowed foreign entities to manipulate Facebook's platform to sow discord during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook, which has more than 2 billion monthly users worldwide, is facing antitrust investigations from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and key lawmakers in the House, a threat that has rattled the company.</p><p>Daniel Ives, an analyst and managing director with the investment firm Wedbush, described the company as \"the center of the beltway firestorm\" over Big Tech.</p><p>Facebook seems to be signaling that its executives are not intimidated by federal investigations into its market power and that it intends to push ahead.</p><p>Just after consumer group Public Citizen this week accused Facebook of seeking to \"entrench [itself] as an unparalleled global monopolist,\" the Libra Association signed up its first 21 member organizations.</p><p>\"Facebook is trying to send a signal that they're not going to back down and they're going to go on the offensive,\" Ives said.</p><p>Facebook has sought to distance Libra from its poisonous reputation, highlighting the other partners in the project. But Facebook's missteps have left the company with little credibility among politicians and K Street insiders.</p><p>\"That's bullshit. I don't think anybody buys that at all,\" said a financial technology industry lobbyist. \"As much as Facebook wants to say that this isn't a Facebook program, they're putting their CEO up to answer for it.\"</p><p>The Libra project faces a crucial test next week when Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. He'll likely face a slew of pointed questions about the project and must satisfy the numerous regulatory concerns posed by Libra's massive reach and complicated structure.</p><p>Lawmakers pressed David Marcus, head of Libra, at a prior hearing for answers about how the project would comply with the complex web of banking, illicit finance, securities and money transferring regulations likely applicable to Libra.</p><p>In a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) over the summer, Marcus insisted, \"We want, and need, governments, central banks, regulators, non-profits, and other stakeholders at the table and value all of the feedback we have received.\"</p><p>While Marcus vowed to satisfy all concerns raised by regulators, lawmakers fumed as he offered little insight into how Libra could be supervised by the federal government.</p><p>\"There's a reason we've seen nearly every household name involved with Libra pull out of the project \u00af the risks are not worth the rewards,\" Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), one of the project's top antagonists in Congress, said in a statement to The Hill. \"I hope next week's hearing will help Mark Zuckerberg recognize these risks, so that he can join his corporate partners in dropping this project.\"</p><p>Top federal regulators have also questioned Facebook's plans, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Libra raises \"many serious concerns\" about financial stability.</p><p>The departure of top financial services firms Visa, Mastercard and PayPal underscores how steep the path to winning Washington's approval will be for Libra, said Ian Katz, managing partner at policy advisory firm Capital Alpha Partners.</p><p>\"They were seen as the adults in the room, the entities that have experience with payment networks and the know-how to thwart illicit transactions,\" Katz wrote in a Sunday research note. \"They could return to the association at some point, but as long as they're absent, the Libra effort is seriously weakened.\"</p><p>Both Visa and Mastercard, established financial institutions, are subject to serious regulatory scrutiny and likely balked at a project that put them at odds with some of the top regulators in the country, Katarina Pistor, director of Columbia Law School's Center on Global Legal transformation, told The Hill.</p><p>Younger companies like Uber, Lyft and Spotify have remained on board, signing on to become some of the founding Libra Association members on Tuesday.
