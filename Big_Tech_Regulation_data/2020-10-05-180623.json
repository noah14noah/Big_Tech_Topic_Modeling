It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Sweeney. Thank you. You may begin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL SWEENEY, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, KILLI LTD.: Hi, everybody. Let's just dive right into it. I'm sure all of you have been listening to a number of different presentations over the last 2 days. So I'd like to introduce you to Killi, K-I-L-L-I. Ticker symbol in Vancouver is MYID and it's MYIDF in the U.S.</p><p>So before we get started, let's kind of talk specifically about kind of the overall investment thesis. I think before we're all investors, we're consumers first. And I think if you think about the 3 most dominant stories that have been in the headlines over the last 2 or 3 weeks, first and foremost, clearly, COVID. And specifically, this concept of COVID tracing has been top of mind for everybody. Last week, we saw the four horseman from Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple in front of Congress, answering questions around antitrust and data. And then lastly, this week, dominating has been the storage, specifically around Microsoft and Tik Tok. But while these stories have been dominant over the last 2 weeks, what people are failing to kind of realize is that, this has nothing to do with antitrust and it has nothing to do with the actual pandemic. Really what the bigger issue here is this concept of what all these stories have in common is the idea of data and more specifically, around privacy. And when you're thinking about data and privacy, it's really about consumer privacy and consumer control of privacy. So these 3 trends, whether it's data privacy, consumer control or antitrust or big tech, at the end of the day, it still comes down to who is collecting this data on these individual consumers.</p><p>So for us, what we believe is that data and privacy will be the largest macro trend of 2020 and 2021. And this is similar to what we've seen in years past, whether it was around blockchain or even around cannabis. And I think the stories that I kind of have highlighted is evidence of this ever kind of growing trend. And so with this in mind, who are the public companies that are really operating in this space. And I think you're going to be hard-pressed to find another company like Killi, who is really leading the chart specifically around this.</p><p>So a little bit more about this market. I think when you ask individual consumers specifically about whether or not they know if data is being collected, although most say, yes, but most have really no understanding as to how much data is actually being collected or what the value is. As an investor, you're likely -- you're unlikely aware that you are actually worth $500 per month per user in North America, and you're growing at an average rate of about 30% per year. How does that happen? When you log in using your Google browser or you log into Facebook or you use Spotify, this is a perpetual data collection. And your consumer data is going over the fence to these individual firms. It's the oxygen of these individual platforms, and this has been going on and building for years and years and years. So whereas these companies continue to actually amalgamate and collect increasingly more data, they're actually turning that data around and actually monetizing. Hence, the reason for the increase in the actual rate.</p><p>Now the important piece about this is that what's driving the increase in the rate is fidelity of data. The higher the fidelity or the more private the data, the more valuable it is. This, as a byproduct, though, has actually caught the attention of the global privacy regulators, specifically around the world. So some of you might be familiar with privacy laws that came into effect in Europe called the General Data Rights Protection Act. It came into effect about 1.5 years ago. Most recently, this came to the United States in the form of the California Consumer Privacy Act, which sort of hit the shores of the West Coast on January 1, 2020.</p><p>In short, what this means is that in order to use people's data going forward, you must have explicit consent from the consumer. The problem with this is that up until now, the 30-plus years of data architecture that have been created have been done so without actually collecting consumer consent. And so these government regulators are putting more and more pressure on these larger companies to ensure that they're actually getting consumer consent, and it's leaving an individual gap in the market.</p><p>So with that in mind, though, there is really no company -- there are really no companies operating in the world today that are actually allowing you, as a consumer, to actually gather control of your data from all of these various different platforms, have visibility specifically on what data these companies have and actually have visibility on what actual value of this data is. And most importantly, whether or not you, as a consumer, should be compensated, we think that this is sort of the larger trend that's actually happening.</p><p>So with Killi, at its core, these are the tools that we're actually building. We are building consumer controls for data. So we are creating a platform to allow you to take your Facebook data, your Google data, your credit card data and pull it all together in one central source, controlled and owned by you. As a byproduct of that, you have transparency on all of the data that's out there. And should you decide to share that and be willing to monetize and will -- be willing to share it with brands, agencies, companies and platforms. Rather than Facebook, Google and others being compensated for the use of your data, we are redistributing this wealth back to the individual consumer. So we think that giving consumers back control of what's rightfully theirs, while also paying them in an environment where we have 15% unemployment and the economic situation is not that great, is sort of -- is a trend that we think is going to help move, not only the visibility of our company, but actually the stock as well.</p><p>So how the mechanism works is you can either download this product as an application from the Apple or Google stores. You can also access this from your browser by logging in, putting in a password. Once inside of the platform, you can pick and choose and decide which individual accounts you would like to actually add. Would you like to link a credit card, would you like to link a social account? These are all up to you. What's really important about this is that inside of the individual platform, you can actually turn on and off at any time that you like, whichever piece of data you would no longer wish to share. Also important to note is that when somebody purchases this data, i.e. a Procter &amp; Gamble, you have a full transparent record of actually whose purchase is paid at. Similar to a banking record where you would log into your Wells Fargo account, and you would see that you spent $5 at Starbucks, you can log into your Killi account and see that Procter &amp; Gamble has bought your location data and you now have $1 sitting in your account. This is important, too, because we pay you in cash. We are not paying you in crypto, we are not paying you in coupons. We are not paying you in offers, and we're not paying you in points. We're paying you in cash because that is actually how data transacts in the real world. And as I mentioned before, this notion of actually redistributing the wealth or the cash back to the consumers away from the opaque market is really kind of where our kind of core intention is.</p><p>What we've also done is we've begun to institute passive revenue opportunities for individual consumers. So we've trademarked such statements as the date dividend or the concept of Fair-Trade Data. These are situations where, should you decide to share location data, you don't have to interact with the application. It's similar to a hydrometer, you would basically pay as you go. So once somebody uses your data, you would get a notification and money would be passively deposited directly into your account.</p><p>So let's take a quick look at a few highlights that we've actually focused on over the last 3 months. Then we'll focus on specifically what we're planning on getting to over the remainder of this quarter and then a few additional catalysts specifically for what we -- for the stock. So in Q2, the focus has really been on the addition of new revenue models for the individual consumers. So we've integrated 3 international research companies into the product. This is important because no matter where the product is launched and the product is currently available in half a dozen countries today: U.S., Canada, Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand, with further global expansion planned, is that no matter where you are in the product, there's always an unlimited opportunity for you to actually earn money for answering questions specifically from research firms. We call this active revenue because you actually have to actively participate in a question that someone is working with you, is asking you.</p><p>We've also introduced this concept of passive revenue. Passive revenue is where you decide to share a specific piece of data and you're compensated passively when that data is actually used. So we've integrated over 20,000 financial firms into the product today. That allows you to link any card from, say, a Wells Fargo, a TD Bank, a Bank of America. And should a hedge fund that in New York decided that they would like to actually purchase this shopping behavior to see which retail stores are actually having trouble during COVID, you would be passively compensated for that. It will be deposited directly into your account and then you could cash out.</p><p>In addition to this, Killi was actually integrated in another company of mine. So on the serial launch of (inaudible), we sold Freckle at the beginning of this year, which put $4 million of cash into the business as well. That's on a draw, it's not $4 million upfront. And then lastly, we've introduced this concept of Fair-Trade Data, which allows consumers to be compensated when advertisers use that data to specifically buy and sell media.</p><p>So I'm going to focus specifically here on the credit card module and then a little bit on the audience Fair-Trade Data because I think those are the 2 real levers from Q2 that are really important. As I mentioned, Visa, American Express, Mastercard, any of these various different types of card from any of the 20,000 financial institutions can be linked to our card. Some of you might be familiar with other publicly traded companies like Cardlytics, et cetera. Cardlytics really would take data from Bank of America user and amalgamate it and then provide it to the market. We think that we're the antithesis of that. We're actually -- if you're not buying it from Bank of America, you're actually buying it from the individual consumer. So we believe that this is even more compliant. But the ability to actually link these cards gives up to 2 years' worth of actual shopping data, which again, brands, agencies, hedge funds, et cetera, are very much interested in.</p><p>From a revenue model perspective, what's important is that there's a 50-50 rev share between ourselves and the individual clients. So if $1 was being paid to a user, we would get $1. If it was $0.50 being paid to a user, we would get $0.50. So the more data that is actually purchased, the more data we actually make.</p><p>Which kind of brings us quickly to this idea of Fair-Trade Data. So this was covered in Forbes Magazine. I would encourage you to read the article on this. And I think this is probably one of the big differentiators that we have in the market. One of the misconceptions that people have is that people buy advertising. Nobody buys advertising. You buy data and then the data manifests into the shape of an advertisement. What that means is that if you were Procter &amp; Gamble and you were looking for a 25- to 54-year old female grocery shopper, you buy that data and then you put a Tide ad on top of it. So all of this data sits inside of these large data management platforms. The big ones are Oracle, LiveRamp, Adobe, Salesforce, et cetera. A lot of this data is unconsented or is referred to as third party. For us, in our past experience, we have integrations with all of these individual platforms to put our Killi data, which is an amalgamation of all of the Killi data into these platforms. So now when you're actually buying a 24-year-old team of grocery shopper, rather than that money going back to the third-party who put the data into Oracle, what we do is we provide a fractional dividend back to every single consumer that actually participated in this.</p><p>So what's important about this is that really every major brand and agency uses these data management firms as their watering hole. This is where they go to buy all the data to power all of their media. We are the only company in the world that is offering audience-targeting segments inside of these platforms that actually reward the consumer. Hence the reason we call it Fair-Trade because you, as the consumer can see who's buying the data and you as the buyer of the data can all -- see all the way through to the other side to see who's actually consented to the data.</p><p>So the last thing I'll say on this before I move on is that in order to sell data, it's not trivial. We don't just get out of bed and get integrations into platforms like Oracle or Google, et cetera. You have to know your way around it. I mean I've been selling data for the last 20 years. And for me, the key is, is that if you want to sell data, you have to have scale of users, and I'll talk to that in the next slide. You have to have ubiquitous distribution, meaning you need to be in all those places where everybody buys data and then you ultimately have to have demand. At Killi, we have all these 3. So we're integrated into all the major platforms. We have buy-in relationships with all the major agencies and brands. And then we also have all the distribution as well.</p><p>So that brings us to Q3 and what we've been working on specifically in Q3. So we'll work back to front here. A global agreement of a top 4 agency holdco. We're hoping to announce that this quarter, where they are using our data to power all of their media. This is a deal that we've already been working on. And we're already -- this company is actually already buying the data. We just have not announced it.</p><p>Additionally, constantly focusing on security. The more modules that we put into the product, security is an always-on, never-ending task for us and making sure that when people are adding credit card data or adding driver's license scans that we are making sure that we are at top from a security perspective.</p><p>I talked about the audience dividend. We believe that this is going to start to manifest in real revenue this quarter. But the 2 pieces that we are actually introducing this quarter is the browser extension to sit on top of the Google Chrome browser as well as the Killi Elite subscription.</p><p>So let me talk to the browser extension, first and foremost. So for context, most of you are familiar with the Google Chrome extension. That's the icon, that's on the left-hand side here. Chrome and its sisters, Edge, Opera and Brave. Those are the browsers to the right of it. They own about 80-plus percent of the browser market. So some of you might think because you have an iPhone that you have Safari, that, that is a powerful browser. The reality is that has basically 3% of the total market. So if you want to do something in the browser space, you have to do something with Chrome. Ultimately for us, we believe the browser is one of the biggest pools of data that is actually leaking personal data directly, specifically actually into Google. So what we know specifically about Google is that they are perpetually collecting all this information. And in fact, there's actually a $5 billion class action lawsuit that Killi was referenced in that -- as a positive example of a company that's actually the antithesis of Google and is providing consumers with actual control of their data. So as I mentioned, 75% to 80% of the global market is in the Chrome market. What we're doing with the browser extension is we're allowing consumers to put all of their browsing data underneath their control for actual sale. What we're also doing is that we will put -- we will give the consumers the opportunity to put an ad blocker on the front end of that browser extension. Why that's important is that this is also a growing trend, 1-in-4, 1-in-5 individual users on the Internet are currently using an ad blocker, but there's not one company in the world that's actually paying people to block ads. We plan on doing that as part of our overall subscription model, which brings us next to Killi Elite, which is the subscription piece of the equation.</p><p>So what we found with Killi Elite, and this is kind of runs in parallel with what former Presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, was talking about when he mentioned universal basic income is that, when you sign up to Killi, to simplify the process is that if you would like to make $1, $2 or $5, you can sign up for a subscription. The subscription is pretty simple. It depends on how much data you're willing to share. The more data you're willing to share, the more money you can actually make. So there's not a company in the world currently that is actually providing a subscription model for consumers to be compensated for the data usage. So we think that the combination of a browser extension, ad blocker that actually pays user, plus an overarching subscription model, specifically for consumers, are 2 very, very differentiated products that you're going to see literally in the next 6 to 8 weeks. And these, we believe, are actually going to be very beneficial for us in creating stickiness amongst the individual clients. We think that just the subscription model itself is going to increase the lifetime value of our users by 3x.</p><p>So I think whenever we talk about Killi, there's always sort of 2 skeptical questions. The first is great, great idea. Ultimately, we believe in this idea that you should get compensated for your data, you'll find very few people who actually disagree with that sort of thesis. The question always becomes, how are you going to scale it, Neil? Or more specifically, how much money can I make? So the question around how much money you can make, it ranges depending upon how much money -- how many pieces of data you're willing to share, but it ranges anywhere from a $1 at the base level to upwards to over $5. And as we add increasingly more modules, that dollar figure will continue to grow, which will increasingly keep people inside of the product.</p><p>But on the scale side, there's really 3 buckets of scale. There is the paid concept, which is that you go to Google or Twitter and you actually buy a user. That's called a cost per acquisition and it's quite dominant amongst most direct-to-consumer kind of companies. There's the organic pillar where you create content, post it on places like Tik Tok, Instagram, that is also quite common. And then there's the partnership component. And so what's important is that we've been doing paid and we've been doing organic, but now we've done the partnership piece. And as a byproduct of us having built the consent framework that allows consumers to opt in and opt out of various pieces of data, what has happened is that companies that have an enormous amount of data that actually are headless, meaning that they have no consumer interaction or they don't have any direct communication with the consumer, have come to us to basically be that consent-as-a-service product, where we are now actually communicating with the consumer on their behalf, allowing them to opt in and opt out. The end result of that is that over the next 2 months, we'll be onboarding over 100 million accounts, specifically in the United States. So the question is always like, how do you get 100 million accounts? As mentioned, we are actually providing the consent framework specifically for companies that actually don't have it. So that's the IP of our business is being able to do that. And just to manage, again, your expectations, you also don't get out of bed, flick the switch and just have 100 million accounts. The goal is to add 50 million of these accounts in August and then 50 million of these accounts in September. We feel confident that we'll be able to add similar types of numbers going into Q4. But this is giving us an enormous amount of scale, which is sort of solidifying the idea that we are the market leader specifically in the space.</p><p>So with that in mind, from a cost per acquisition point of view, meaning, how are you actually getting people into your base. The cost per acquisition for us is actually crashing. Whereas in the past, we would have had to actually pay for a user to come in at that $2. Now companies are coming to us and actually paying us to actually work with them specifically on this. And so the cost per acquisition from a model perspective is actually shrinking, whereas the average revenue per user is actually growing. And the average revenue per user, as sort of presented here on the purple side of this circle, is all of those additional modules that we put in.</p><p>In short, nothing bad happens when you give more money to consumers. The more money you give to a consumer, the less likely they are to leave the product. The more money you give to a consumer, the longer they'll stay in the product. So if you're thinking about the bottom component of this, which is lifetime value, if you want to increase the lifetime value of the consumer, the fastest way to do that is actually pay people more money.</p><p>So we are laser-focused really on how are we actually redistributing more and more wealth to these individual consumers by actually bringing on more and more different modules. So that ties back to the browser extension, subscription, et cetera. These are all things which are going to increase average revenue per user, which will increase lifetime value. That, in combination with kind of a reduced cost per acquisition, creates the unit economics of this model, which actually put us in a situation where we believe that, by the end of this quarter, we're going to be in a cash flow-positive position.</p><p>And as you can see from this slide, sort of that very faint pink slide -- that pink images, that is the crashing of our cost per acquisition, which is really in green, kind of our unit economics. The bar graph that is represented here is the dollar value that you can actually get from each of the individual modules. And so when you put 100 million people on top of this pre-existing module -- this pre-existing business model with more and more modules, you'll generate more and more revenue. So the best way to think about this is that the more people you get, the more data you get. The more data you get, the more brands you get. The more brands you get, the more money you get and around and around you go. So we are looking to push towards this revenue flywheel. What we feel that we have is that we feel that we've got the hardest part done, and that is getting the actual individual scale.</p><p>So what this looks like from an average revenue per user kind of goals by the data dividend point of view, this sort of outlines for you what some of these things look like. So you can answer surveys, you can do -- you can opt in to location, you can watch videos, you can participate in the audience dividend that I may reference to, you can link a credit card. All of these things are different ways in which you can actually make more money. For us, as an individual company, we participate in every single one of these modules. So when you, as a consumer, link a credit card and that credit card gets sold, you get paid, we get paid. So again, we are incented to have more users sharing increasingly more and more data.</p><p>So just to kind of quickly sort of summarize here is that as mentioned, we believe that this concept of data privacy and consumer control of data is a larger trend that is clearly not going away anytime soon. We think that it's looking at kind of the market leaders around the world. We feel that we're at that table. I think you're going to be hard-pressed to find public companies that are operating at this scale with this kind of focus specifically on this market. The Data Privacy regulatory market is global. This is not just U.S., this is in Europe, this is in Canada, this is in United States. Every country in the world is implementing new data privacy policy, which is creating an opportunity for us, as a company, to continue to expand our scale.</p><p>Talking specifically about the scale, as I mentioned, adding 100 million accounts in Q3, with similar growth in Q4, we think, kind of allows us to kind of run away with the market. This is a global trend. While we're in half a dozen countries now, we plan on continuing to expand further and further. That revenue flywheel that I made reference to is quite simple in nature, is that, if you're looking at those 3 unit economics: average revenue per user, cost per acquisition and lifetime value, and you're squeezing those to get to a neutral module -- neutral level, as soon as you can get to cash flow positive, then the revenue compounds quite quickly.</p><p>And then lastly, the momentum is that we believe that we're the market leader in the space. So with that in mind, I'll kind of quickly answer a few Q&amp;A questions if anybody has them.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>NEIL SWEENEY: There's a question here specifically around what makes your company unique from your competition, in particular, BIGtoken.</p><p>So I would say that big token is schizophrenic. One, they're an investor relations firm. They are sometimes identity firm. They're sometimes a crypto firm. They're sometimes a social firm. We're none of those things. We're focused entirely on identity. So I think that's probably the biggest difference between us. I think that there's also some other things trying to get money out of BIGtoken. They have minimum $20 redemptions for consumers, which we think is unfair. It's also -- we don't think it's transparent. Whereas for us, you can redeem at $5. BIGtoken also doesn't do anything from an audience perspective. It also doesn't do anything from a passive perspective. So we actually don't think the BIGtoken as competition. Any other questions? Okay, great. Thanks so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. This concludes today's webinar.

This session is for investing clients only and if media or other individuals on the line, please disconnect now. Disclosures are available here and on the webcast on the disclosures tab. We're pleased to have with us Kilroy Realty and CEO John Kilroy. John, I'll turn over to you to introduce your management team and provide a couple minutes of opening remarks and then we'll go to Q&amp;A.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN KILROY, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Great. Okay. Well, thank you for having us. To my right is Tyler Rose, our CFO, who I think most of you know, and David Simon was here a moment ago, our guide David Simon and how do want to start this? Do you want to just ask questions or you want me to say something?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I can ask question and (multiple speakers).</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Perfect. Let's go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So the first question we're asking everyone. You have 60 seconds to pitch Kilroy stock to new investor and why they should own it over others in the office sector, and now we're going to time you. So, you've 60 seconds.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Okay, real quickly. Kilroy saw earlier than everybody else where office space was going and it's really gone through a transformation. It's gone through a total transformation. A lot of office space you see in the country is now obsolete or becoming obsolete. What we did is to reposition our portfolio and the geography in which we operate. So we're big in Seattle in South Lake Union and Bellevue, which are big tech clusters. We're very big in the San Francisco market, in Silicon Valley markets and down in West Los Angeles, Hollywood -- Hollywood is a very much emerging area, and of course in San Diego. So what we've done is we've sold product that doesn't comport to the future where tenants are going. We positioned ourselves with the assets we bought next to public transportation, all the amenities that the modern workforce wants, and we're building best-in-class assets that are exactly the kind of properties that the most in-demand tenants want. We're doing Dropbox's headquarters, Salesforce's headquarters. We're doing -- we just finished Synopsys' headquarters, big thing for Apple and LinkedIn, DIRECTV's world headquarters, Viacom's new West Coast headquarters. All these assets are producing somewhere between 7.75% to north of that in initial returns for best in product market assets. So think about that compared to buying assets of 3% and 4% that are older and are going to face a lot of CapEx. That's our formula.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: When you sit down as a management team and you talk about those trends, you say: Hey, look, we're leasing to all these tech companies. They're getting brand new office space. They're paying up for it. They're growing really quickly. Are those all positive trends when you sit down sort of behind closed doors or do you worry about some of those?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I worry about everything all the time. I think David Lee said it best, you worry when the market is not great. When the market is fantastic, you worry more because you're wondering whether you're going to miss the inflection point to minimize risk. We minimize risk as follows. We do tremendous preleasing. We just delivered $540 million that's 100% leased. We have $1 billion underway that's 83% leased in the office. There's a component of resi that you don't lease till the end. So, traditionally we've been about 60% preleased. But in this cycle, we've been over 90%. We're going to continue with very high preleasing. And the other way we mitigate risk is we operate with about 28% leverage, and everything we underwrite is to roughly 28% to 30% leverage. So we're not going to get over our skis on debt. In terms of the types of tenants, less than 9% of our tenant base are start-ups. So we're dealing generally with companies with real balance sheets, with real income that have real demand and they're not over leasing space. And then if you look at the markets we're in, all of those markets are the most high demand markets where companies want to grow, whether they're tech, whether they're media or whether they're the fire category. So we're feeling pretty strong right now with what we're seeing in the marketplace, but there will come a time when it's not appropriate to build, where it's not appropriate to buy. That time of buying right now acquisitions I think is more upon us than most people think because what we're seeing now is people buying assets that are not going to serve them well over a long period of time at high price per square foot, which require substantial increases in market rents to make them work. So I think the risk is more on what you buy and how you execute than some of the questions you just asked about, is the tech -- the inputs I got is, is tech going to go away. Everything goes away over time or at least it diminishes. The key is to be well leased and long-term leases and we favor long-term leases.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You made a comment about companies that aren't overleasing space. How do you measure that?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, if you look back to 2000 roughly, companies were overleasing space 20% to 30%. Today, they are over leasing space by about under 5%. So the statistics we look that are helpful, that are by no means all encompassing. We see activity is strongest in our markets and yet it is 50% less than it was in 2000. IPO activity is about 50% less. We see activity is really about 50% less and the shadow space that people are leasing is far less. There is much greater discipline than I've ever seen in my career in terms of companies that are growing so quickly in the way they're managing their balance sheet, in the way they're taking down space. So I think those are all really good trends, but at the end of the day, there is nothing like having leases that are staggered over time and if you're developing having pre-leasing in your pocket, because that's really how you mitigate risk and I think maximize returns over time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: How do you think about, specifically for San Francisco Prop M, do you think it was a positive or negative for you?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: It's funny. Prop M was something that was created 20 years ago and for those who don't know, that pours just under 900,000 square feet of entitlements and do think of a jug, pours in, in every year and if it's not being used, then it accumulates and so there is only about 3 million square feet in that jug right now. And over time, as people develop space, they're going to be in a queue. It's not a queue like a baker's queue. If you're number four at Starbucks, you wait for the other three people in front of you. This is -- some people call it beauty contest. It's what the city feels is going to be in the best interest, whether it's funding their infrastructure or whether it's because you're preserving a certain operation that's been historically part of the fabric of the city. So, in Prop M, you want to make sure where you are in the queue and we feel very strong that we're going to do $450 million project called the Exchange on 16th at Mission Bay. We have a letter of intent on roughly 300,000 square feet of that long-term credit lease. We're in negotiations with other very high credit companies on that. It's one of the few spaces that can be built right now that is in a location that people want.</p><p>In terms of future development, we have assembled a little over five acres. It's called a Flower Mart between Fifth and Sixth Street on Brannan. It's probably as best we can tell two years from being entitled it's going to jump a lot of sites that are not as important. We're maintaining the Flower Mart on the property, we'd taken off temporarily and then we put it back, that's a 110 year institution of the city. Very important to keep all those flower growers and sellers in the marketplace. We think that positions us very well vis-a-vis other sites that are going to be looking for entitlements and I can tell you that in terms of dollars per square foot FAR cost, we're going to be somewhere between $50 and $70 in FAR foot cost for that project in a market in which unentitled properties that's behind us is trading for $180 to $200 plus per FAR foot cost and our entitled property is trading for $270 to $300 an FAR foot, if it's entitled.</p><p>So what I think is very important and what we tried to do in our Company is when you have entitlement risk, meaning the duration it takes to get entitlement is to make sure you're in at a basis that you can afford at the time that it may take to receive those entitlements and still be able to make money. So we see Prop M as I don't like it from a policy standpoint, but it's a reality and as long as it's a reality, you have to live with it and you need to be very careful in what you're buying locationally and at what price to make sure you can make money when you finally get to develop it and I think there are some others that are making some calculations that are more optimistic than us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: There's been some stuff in the press on the community not wanting to do anything at the FAR as such, believe it as those don't touch it. It's been [their front] for 10 years, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good enough. Does that hurt your ability to get entitlements or you think you're just going to work past that?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Does that hurt our ability to what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: To get entitlements or you're just going to work (multiple speakers)?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, you know, California is a tough place to get entitlements, right. If anybody for $38 can file a sequel lawsuit once you've received the City Council permission or whatever required. There are activists in the city and many of them have a valid point that they want to see the Flower Mart continue to operate in the city. When we were in escrow to buy these properties and we couldn't address the activists' concerns because we are basically doing two M&amp;A transactions and then we had all kinds of SEC and other regulations that we have comport with. Since that time, we've made it clear that we've entered into a 25-year leased with the Flower Mart. It's our intent and desire and we will keep them there for the long term on a very favorable basis to them. So I'm very optimistic that working with the activists and others that we will be able to get this property entitled to the betterment of the city, and to the betterment of the flower growers and so forth and the residents and to our shareholders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Questions from the room.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you give us an update on what's going on at One Paseo?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: One Paseo, that's a project that's mixed use, that we bought the land probably 6.5 years ago to [go turn on] round numbers. It's 23 acres, it was owned for 500,000 square feet of office which would work with surface parking and so forth that we wanted to do something that was more in keeping with the modern workforce. So we worked with the city and we worked with various residents and so forth to come up with a mixed-use project and we received entitlement, rather approval of our entitlements from the City Council a week ago today. And that was a long sojourn I give credit to I think Jed Reagan and his Green Street who came up with the term entitlement purgatory, that's where we were but it's been worth it. And this is what we're going to be able to build. Two, nine story office buildings that are about 480,000 square feet in round numbers, 275,000 square feet of retail, most of which we have leased and three phases of apartments, which total about 608 units. So the estimated cost at round numbers is about $750 million, that's about $610 million or so of new spend. We think we produced a very nice attractive return with that on a property that is going to be, I think the best project mixed-use project in San Diego, certainly one of the best on the West Coast. We're very excited about it, it's a market which has -- needs more apartments, needs more retail and the office space numbers now work which is good because through this uplifting over the last four years, we now see San Diego have a [duress] of Class A space and Del Mar is the most desirable market in San Diego. Now I want to caution everybody that while we can all wait pom-poms for those of us who have been waiting for this to happen, there is a sequel, which is the California Environmental Quality Act and anybody for $38 can file a lawsuit against you and then you have to defend your project because they actually file the lawsuit against the city and then it's based upon a review of your environmental (inaudible) report, did you properly consider everything and so forth. We've had four different major law firms' peer review and they think we're in a really good shape, but it remains to be seen, but we still have a few pom-poms in the air because this has been a long process. Now we go through (inaudible) and then we hopefully can start construction within a year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: How long until we know if those lawsuits were filed and settled?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Your guess is as good as mine, but I would think -- I don't know what's the statutory, I think they have 45 days, but don't hold me to that. I'm not a lawyer and I haven't been through many secret channels, but I'm sure somebody will file and just because there's a shopping center guy -- anybody from JP Morgan here, I need to talk to you afterwards because you're partner is the guy who has funded all the bad guys. But there is a guy across the street that -- he has to publicly disclose, so he's spent -- I think it was $1.5 million or near about in the fourth quarter being the fly in the ointment. He wants say an exclusive, and he is not going to get one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Are you going to do the apartments yourself or are you going to partner that out?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We get this question a lot. And just to put in perspective apartments, Dave -- David runs our Southern California operations, and one of the projects we have underway that's very well leased on the office front and he has a big apartment building that comes on stream in early 2016, right? That's about $120 million worth 200 luxury units. In One Paseo, we will have 600 plus units. In the Academy Square project that we will likely start first quarter of next year in Hollywood, we have about 250 units. So, round number is [1,100, 1,200 units] that is a part of next year's projects. Here's the thinking that we had and how we acted on this. We could go out to any number of apartment companies, public or otherwise, and do a venture. And we could do on the retail components go out to any number of retail REITs and do a venture. But first, you've got to get entitled, then you want to get it going. I don't want to spend our brain power doing all these joint ventures that then have to get re-done several times as your entitlements change and so forth, people with different investment horizons, different capital structures, different ownership timeframes. I want to make sure we have projects that work, that can go together, that we can use our energy and talent to get them entitled, get them underway and then we have optionality with regard to those residential units. We can sell them, we can venture them, we can own them. We're not going to become an apartment company. Okay. We're not going to become an apartment company. Whether we'll own some apartments or venture them remains to be seen. But in the context of our shareholders, we believe that the actions we've taken to be able to position ourselves and get these things going were expedited by the direction we went and we have apartment experts and so forth that we fired. And with regard to the exit, if we exit or whether we own, all that is or the most of it is going to accrue to our shareholders as opposed to somebody else. So that's the thinking that's behind it, we made sure we have the capabilities of senior people and construction people and so forth in the enterprise in our Company to execute on this and it's going really well. And in the meantime, the cap rates that we underwrote the Hollywood project Columbia Square initially were about 6.5%, mid-6s in market for that product that's trading under four. So we think it's going to be pretty good for our shareholders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Was there a thinking that they definitely was bringing in sort of a development partner but non-ownership partner, was that different than it would be at One Paseo or is that sort of similar?</p><p>TYLER ROSE, EVP &amp; CFO, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Well, I'll tell about Hollywood, I mean what we brought in is a highly respected and company that has done apartments, has done hospitality and help us kind of perfect the strategy that we want to do and they have just a management agreement with an incentive. So it's an incentive management agreement. But we got their expertise associated with that and it's all, it's a great relationship. With respect to One Paseo, I think we could do that there as John said, there's any number of apartment guys that approach us in various structures coming in, partnering with us, managing with us and I think we're sorting through all those interview and trying to figure out the best way to execute ultimately what we're doing down there, but we have great product in these locations. We have our choice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Any questions from the floor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi John, in terms of -- you're in some great markets, all growth markets that I think most of your peers would like to be in. But when you guys said and you look at where do I allocate the next incremental dollar today, is it San Francisco, is it Hollywood, is it Del Mar, is it something, is it Seattle?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Look, San Francisco is, at least on the West Coast, a class by itself. Everybody wants to be in San Francisco, and because of the growth, and this is-- what's happened is this. Think about technology, entertainment and all these different companies what's their most important asset. People, their people cost roughly 80%, real estate costs roughly 5%. You pay 20% more for your real estate but it positively influences the 80% either by attracting, retaining or being more productive, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fantastic leverage. We do not get into a long negotiations on rental rates. We do at the [French] but it's not like the old days, it's more like will the facility, does it have the locational characteristics and the amenities and the (inaudible) and so forth that's necessary for us to attract and retain people. So, I'm going to start with the fact that we want to be in those markets that are really going to be terrific markets for the long-term. Whereas to how we allocate the incremental dollar, right now, in San Francisco we have about $1.5 billion between the two projects. About a third of that is the Exchange on 16th, which will start this year. A couple years out San Francisco, I'm not sure how much more Prop M risk we want to take and what we're seeing right now is some of the projects that would be good projects that they were entitled but are going to be later in the queue. I think a lot of those are going to recalibrate and come back to us because we are already having people say, would you recap us or would you venture this with us and so forth. So more to be seen there. In South Lake Union, the property we bought at 333 Dexter, it is 580,000 feet, it is $350 million plus a couple of our parcels. We're negotiating with somebody right now for the entire year that whether we do the deal or not, I don't know. Surprise, surprise, it's a major tech company and down in San Diego, we mentioned that project, more and more of media and so forth in Hollywood. So I'm not going to say that we are going to do more in this market or that market other than what I've said, we're going to be opportunistic, but we are not going to get to a point where we have a lopsided company. Six years ago, we are 100% Southern California and we were 55% San Diego. Today on a pro forma basis, meaning this stuff that we have under development gets completed tighter, what are basically our ratios?</p><p>TYLER ROSE: 35% to 40% San Francisco, 15% to 20% Seattle, 25% LA and the remainder [about some 20%] San Diego.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: And what I had said year ago when people asked me five years ago how do you see over time the balance of the portfolio, I said it kind of feels right, half is in the southern part of the state and half of it's sort of San Francisco and points north. That's kind of what we've done. San Francisco by -- and by the way, we're talking about percentage, we're talking about NOI, we're not talking about square footage. We are very clued into what major companies are doing, what their expansion plans are, we talk to them all the time about what we're doing and cross marketing, they talk to us about what we are doing and what they're doing. And so the way this plays out over time, I'm not going to be hard and fast and say it's 50% Southern California, 50% points north, but that feels pretty good. I've said San Diego a few years ago, I see kind of if what we have been as square footage now or NOI, not as a percentage, but just absolute amount if that's X, 120% to 80% of X seems about right. I'm sure we'll bounce around maybe a little one side or the other at times.</p><p>We're focused more on where we see extraordinary value that can be created and to put a couple of metrics for you into perspective, right now in San Francisco, Class A office space is really well-located. It's going to trade somewhere between 3% and 5% depending upon weather has problems etcetera, etcetera. And it's going to closer to that lower number. It's going to in the threes more than the fives. In San Diego, we're seeing high fours to high fives depending upon whether it's really Class A or whether it's more suburban stuff. We're selling $250 million right now down there. That's going to be in the fives, but it's not stuff that we want to own for long-term but we turnaround and put that stuff into 7.75%, 8% plus brand new state-of-the-art projects that have all the modern features and locationally, in fact, they're where people want to be, we're going to continue to do that trade. So I don't want you to get hung up on percentages here percentages there but it kind of feels right sort of 50% north 50% south, 25%, 20% San Diego. Now all San Diego people who listen to this call are going be upset [at] for me because they're going to interpret that as we're selling off San Diego. We're going to sell some stuff in LA. We have, we're going to sell some stuff in San Francisco at some point, we're going to sell some stuff in Seattle at some point because at the end of the day, we do not have a mother fixation about any particular piece of property. We are in the business to make money on a per share basis. So we look at the denominator when you buy stuff and we look at what where the values over time and if we see substantial increases in value, we're going to keep the asset and if we don't see substantial increases in value or at least not, there is still long before you can uncork it, then we're probably going to sell it at some point. So you'll see us continue to be very active as we've been in the last three years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: As we sit today, when might some of those sales start to come up?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, we have $250 million in San Diego. The smaller buildings, all good buildings. Some of them are worried because the stuff we're selling is better than most of the stuff I see a lot of people buying but we have $250 million in the market in San Diego, right now I think we took best in finals last week or thereabouts. So (inaudible) whether there might be another best and final round. We're selling a $50 million property in Redmond Washington. We recently recapped the lease with Microsoft, it's non-strategic asset, great building. It was the first building we bought up there. That's going to be sold and we've sort of said that this year, we would do sort of $250 million to $400 million worth of sales. Could be quite a bit more than that, I don't know, don't have anything else in the market right now, but we are getting a lot of request to sell some of the big campuses we've done over the last few years at pretty tremendous cap rates. Tremendous means, very low cap rates.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tyler, how do you think about funding One Paseo, that's $600 million that you have to spend there?</p><p>TYLER ROSE: Well, the strategy for funding is going to be the same, it's disposition strategy and unsecured debt strategy and then equity, and we've been doing about a third, a third, a third. We raised $100 million on our ATM in the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to use the ATM as needed. As John said, we have $300 million in the market on dispositions and we have one debt maturity at the end of the year. That's about $325 million. And we will probably raise a little bit more than that at that point. But going forward, on these future development opportunities, it will be the same combination of those three elements to raise the capital. Right now, we have about $500 million of spending this year, which we can cover with, that's ATM and the dispositions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: John, can you go through the Bay Area sub-markets and where is -- what are the preferred locations? Talk about the (inaudible) or other dynamics and has it changed over the last year or so?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, look at the city to begin with, you have Market Street, you have the North Financial, which is the historic Financial District, insurance companies, lawyers, financial institutions and so forth. Market buildings over there, some of them have become more commodity like because they're not close to public transportation. They are not on the south side of market, which has been the high area of demand. By no means am I criticizing people who own facilities on the north side. We've not bought any there, and there is a reason. You don't get quite as high a rent unless you have a really terrific view space and most -- the biggest segment, if you think of a pie of demand, 70 some odd percent don't want to be north of market. So we just look at the math and say: okay, so let's be on the other side where we've been able I think the proof is in the pudding. We started by building at 333 Brannan. Dropbox leased it a week after we started construction. You've seen the pattern time and time again with the buildings we've done over there. The rents that we're able to achieve over there are higher. The terms are better. It's stronger demand if the transportation is better. When the city determined that they were going to build a Transbay Terminal 20 years ago, they knew that the center of the city would shift to the south side of Market Street. That's exactly what's happened. And then you have the Central SoMa Corridor, the subway that will connect BART on market with stops intervening one of blocks in the Flower Mart, then to Caltrain. So BART for those who don't know connect everybody to the East Bay so people go back and forth. Caltrain is the primary way other than automobile that you connect to the South Bay meaning Silicon Valley and down beyond. And then the Central Corridor connects all of that.</p><p>So we're very much captive to the notion that the modern workforce needs to be next to public transportation. And if you look at all the statistic kids aren't doing drivers' license, they can -- you can't afford to build a parking -- they won't let you build the parking and with the density, you just got to be there. So that's the city. Moving on down South. On the Peninsula, power vault is fantastic. Again, buildings near power vault. Middle part fantastic, very hard to build there. We own a lot of property there. We are a 100% leased there, you go down to the Sunnyvale. And middle part, by the way is a battleground between LinkedIn and of course the big Google. Everybody is trying to secure their futures. So the property values there have just gone out of whack. It's very hard to buy anything. Sunnyvale is the same thing. Apple has just grown like mad there. LinkedIn grown like mad there, Facebook's expanding like mad. For those of you who follow this a plug from my buddy (inaudible) done in selling property to Facebook and to Google where they bought big swaths of property that's currently industrial to protect their flanks for the future growth and you're just seeing, the closer you are to the city, the more valuable. As you go down to San Jose, don't like that market at all. Nobody seems to want to go there. Santa Clara has done pretty well. Go to the East Bay there is Oakland and you know, we don't spend any time looking at Oakland. Not that Oakland will do well over time, I guess, but we think -- we are very much about office, where you can get things leased and make money, charge higher rents over time and defense where people want to be. I have seen this time and time again where people go to the out fringe because everything internally is all these stuff and the rates are high, then the market reduces in terms of demand and the people that's are on the fringe move back in. I've been doing this longer I think than anybody in this room, I would make that bet, okay. I see some grey hairs. It's nice to see a few people with grey hair, prematurely grey I know. You can't fight reality and reality is that people want to be in the best buildings in the best locations if they can afford it. So you got to think defense for long game, and some of the markets I don't think are defensive by nature, they're opportunistic. So for a trader they might make sense at any given time but we're not traditionally traders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: For potential joint venture, I'm sure there's lots of sovereign wealth guys that are talking to you guys about doing stuff. If you think about like a single tenant Salesforce tower versus some of the mixed-use stuff you guys are developing currently, would you be more likely to JV a single tenant, long-term lease building like Salesforce, or one of mixed-use projects that you guys are developing either in Hollywood or potentially down in San Diego?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Bill, you're trying to put me on a hot seat. Let's not say Salesforce, let's just say some of the stuff, very well leased single tenant. Those are obvious assets over time to sell and trade into something else or to venture. We have everybody in the world trying to -- I shouldn't say everybody, but quite a few players that are major international, whether they're sovereigns or major pension bonds, they would love to venture with us. Some of the things we've recently completed, some of things that we have underway, both in the north and the south, we look at that. I think most of you know me know that I don't really like partners. I've got a whole bunch of partners I call the public, okay? But they're not trying to tell me every day how to negotiate a deal and spending a long time with lawyers to figure out whether we're on the same page. Having said that, with the exception of CMBS, which we don't do, the one area in our capital stack, if you will, that we don't have is the sovereign and do we do a sovereign or a major pension fund, do we do something on one of our assets in due course? Maybe, but it would be with the thought that they -- you'd have an expanded relationships some time when maybe there is an [interruptance] in the market and there's a great inflection point to be major buyers again, because a lot of the stuff that we bought that we've been given a lot of kudos for during the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 cycle I suppose in retrospect, we should have bought twice as much. And if you see that kind of an opportunity again, you want to make sure you have the capital source to do it. So maybe, maybe. Nothing imminent, no negotiations are underway. Every partner I ever had always ended up on a different playbook at the end. They always wanted something different and you weren't in alignment and just was mind boggling. So I have a natural tendency to like simple, so that we're agile, and we are not just didn't meetings to have meeting. But that doesn't mean never.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Any last questions from the room? Alright. we'll switch to the rapid fire, John. What will same-store NOI growth be for the office sector in 2016?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: The office sector? I don't know. You guys know that. I don't follow anybody else. We've said, it's somewhere in 2.5% to 3.0% range but we have very little to lease. I will tell you that our mark to market in San Francisco 300,000 feet or so that comes up this year is about, we're about 50% under market. So we like that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: But throw in a number? [I'll settle for it] now.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: 3.5% for the sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: For the sector.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Then we better beat them. You want your bonus.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Are cap rates for your assets higher or lower one year from today?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I saw that panel that Michael did and I wrote, I thought they'd be about the same. So I'm kind of guessing that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Higher or lower?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Higher or lower. (technical difficulty) I think the cap rates are pretty good, we're seeing a lot more pressure in terms of folks that want to buy stuff. So I think they could go lower, but I don't know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: What inning are we in this real estate cycle?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Depends on the market. I think we're probably in kind of a mid-game in San Diego. We might be an inning or two one way or the other in San Francisco, it is just hard to tell. What I know a fair amount about is where major companies are going and what their plans are for two years and three years out. Whether there's something that come along macro that interrupts their plans, I can't tell you, but it feels pretty strong. I feel for what I'm seeing and hearing with our client base and demand I'm feeling that there is more life left today than I thought there was at this time last year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: All right, thank you.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: You are welcome.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

This session is for investing clients only and if media or other individuals are on the line, please disconnect now. Disclosures are available here and on the webcast on the disclosures tab. For those in the room or on the webcast, you can sign on to slido.com, enter code Citi17, this is Room Regency 1, to submit any questions, if you don't want to raise your hands. We're pleased to have with us, Kilroy Realty's CEO, John Kilroy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, turn over to you to introduce your management team and provide a couple of minutes of opening remarks. And then, we'll go to Q&amp;A.</p><p>JOHN KILROY, CEO, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Okay. Thank you, Manny. To my left is Tracy Murphy, who runs our Life Science practice, also responsible for the Bay Area as Lead there. To my right is, Tyler Rose, our CFO and to his right is Michelle Ngo, who is the Senior Vice President in the Finance Group. So, thank you for having us. What was the next part of that?</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Opening remarks.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Great, well thanks. Kilroy is just now in its 21st year as a public company. We've been very active over the last seven years. I think, if you look at the great bulk of financial transactions the Company has done over 20 years, the rate bulk of it's been the last seven. We've increased our geographic footprint from all of Southern California to now being the leader in development and ownership in the City of San Francisco, very large in San Diego -- rather in Seattle as well. We just completed our first residential project in our Columbia Square project in Hollywood. We're getting the highest rents, I think of any apartment complex in Southern California, if not all of California. We have a number of development projects underway. We just completed $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of developments that was essentially 100% leased. We think we've really put together a great team and a great program, which is going to allow us to increase NOI over the next seven years by about a 100% or so.</p><p>So, that's my opening remarks and ask me your questions.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Great. We've been kicking off these sessions asking companies, what differentiates you from your property sector peers that you expect will result in outperformance in your stock over the next year versus those peers?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, I think, let's first start with the fact that we are in the best markets in the country. Secondly, the Kilroy has a vertical platform. We are very involved in development and always have been. We understand that business very well. We have a strong capital allocation track record as evidenced by the last seven years and we have a large $4 billion plus development pipeline. It's extremely accretive, think about developing to the high 7% or 8% ROCs unlevered. And depending on [when to use] the 4% cap rate or 5% cap rate, that's basically creating another $3 billion or $4 billion worth of value once that $4 billion pipeline is executed.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Great. Maybe we'll just jump in market-by-market, starting from San Francisco. It's an update on exchange.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Okay. Well, San Francisco has about 3.2 million square feet of low rise product, that's under 20 larger floor plate products. It's underway including our 100 Hooper project that we just fully leased to Adobe, that was the largest lease executed in the last year in San Francisco. Of that -- of the six buildings that are in that 3.2 million square feet, they are all 100% leased except for the exchange which is the one that just started construction about a year ago. And then if we look at the high rise product in San Francisco, there was about 3.9 million square feet under construction, which is about 35% leased. So, what we're very enthused about with the exchanges, we have exactly the kind of product that is most in demand and we are the only one in the market that is available. We've been working on a transaction over the past several months and we announced that we have a letter of intent for the entirety of the building on a 20-year lease and then we announced the fourth quarter call that has changed where that particular tenant wanted to have an ownership position in the property. We have decided that we don't want to go that route with them. So we are going to continue to -- we've double tracked that. We have about half Life Science -- half or equal parts Life Science and technology companies that are interested in that. We are negotiating three letters of intent for five, six of that 750,000 square feet.</p><p>So we believe, we'll have that project leased before -- largely before the end of the year at an initial return on cost of approximately 8% with 3% bumps. So we're very excited. If you look at Life Science in the city, there is essentially 0% vacancy. If you look at the office in Mission Bay, there is essentially 0% vacancy. And if you look at demand, it's become very strong in the last several months. And if you look at supply, it's regulated by what we call Prop M. So, there is very little new supply that you'll see coming on stream for years to come.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Why do technology there at all? Why not go 100% Life Science?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: The yields are about the same and the building was designed, so we could go either way. It's up to Tracy. She is parallel tracking with a number of different companies. The nice thing is, we're seeing very strong demand for the exchange.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: You're something about bringing a partner, even if it's not the one you talked about?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: That's what I didn't like about is, that we don't need a partner. We really don't want to partner. And the particular tenant wanted to become a partner and that just adds an element of uncertainty and complication that we just didn't like.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Why didn't you just mix it in the first place? Why even bring it up, especially, publicly?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Pardon me.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: If you didn't want a partner, I'm sure that's something you thought about before announcing it to us and yourself, so --</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Yes, we thought it would work, but now as we see the complications associated with their process, it's just not something we want to go through.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: The PDR space at Hooper, is that something we just have to wait and see until sort of down or you're going to get there before hand?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: For those who don't know, PDR is production, design and repair. It's a designation of space and all the office space 320,000 square feet was leased by Adobe. There is 80,000 square feet of PDR. We sort of perform at that at the low-$30 triple-net, the most recent deals in PDR of quality space have gone roughly $60 triple-net. So, we think we're going to do better than we forecasted. PDR does not lease a year-and-a-half in advance. So, we think we're in really good shape. We're dealing, talking with some auto tech and other people, so that's going to come along in the next year.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: -- goes to one of these automated or other auto tech companies, what do you think other options are?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I can't say for sure. I mean, there are a lot of different kinds of PDR. But this is going to be high level because of very high quality and the City of San Francisco is very progressive in this way. They do not want to see PDR space displaced by office space or residential. So basically, what you're going to see in the future is what we're doing at the Flower Mart by saving that group and at 100 Hooper by introducing PDR, is that people are getting it at -- get used to the fact that if you're displacing PDR, you're going to have to incorporate it into your projects somehow for the future because they are not going to displace blue collar workers and the types of services and so forth the community needs. So, it's a different twist if you will or requirement that developers have not had to deal with in the past.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Does the flower market at Flower Mart fulfill the PDR requirement or are you going to have additional PDR space there as well?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Flower Mart is the largest PDR development in the City. So, they're very pleased with that.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Any updates, so that you can share on Flower Mart generally?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, Flower Mart it will be entitled over the next couple years. It's a $2 billion project in round numbers. It'll have 2 million square feet of office space and multiple buildings, big floor plates, high ceiling heights. It's on about 7 acres. It's the second largest office development in the history of the City. The first being (inaudible) Center maybe about 40 or 50 years ago. It also incorporates about 125,000 square feet of Flower Mart. The Flower Mart is a 110-year-old institution in the City of San Francisco. They've made space available, the city asked for us to move the Flower Mart temporarily, while we build the new Flower Mart project. And then finally it has a 125,000 square feet plus or minus of market hall. So, it becomes a transformative projects in this new area that's sort of the west extension of SoMa and adjacent to the new Central Subway line that is under construction and fully funded, and the Central Subway connects BART, over the Market Street it connects BART, which connects to [leased] Bay and then goes south, connects with Caltrain, which connects you down with the high-speed rail that goes down to a point south in the peninsula.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Any questions in the room, particularly on San Francisco before we move on? Anyone?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: How has Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics and I know it's in Southern California, but the Snap IPO, does that change the feeling from the venture capitalist in the tech community?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, venture capitalist are making big investments. And the thing that I think is really interesting -- and yes the Snap, obviously -- and think what Riot Games has done. That's what Snap is doing. I mean this -- the ecosystem in Los Angeles is maturing and getting bigger. We're seeing it in the media and entertainment areas. And if you think about the technology companies like Amazon, Netflix and so forth, I mean they're obviously looking for a content and expertise on the media areas. So, I think that plays very well for Los Angeles, for Hollywood, et cetera.</p><p>I think the other thing it's often overshadowed is what's going on in the way of M&amp;A activity by both the -- tech as well as by traditionally non-tech. In our portfolio, over the past couple of years, we've seen Microsoft buy LinkedIn, we've seen AT&amp;T buy DIRECTV, we've seen Tencent buy Riot Games, we've seen WPP buy AKQA, that's advertising, and on, and on, and on. We've seen Adobe buy things, Cisco just bought AppDynamics. And outside portfolio, you've recently seen Walmart buy a major technology company, so they can better compete with Amazon. You've seen GM go in and the other (technical difficulty) car companies go in buy Autotech people.</p><p>And so, there is incredible virtuous cycle of companies that are both all tech as well as non-tech, needing to buy cutting-edge new technologies. And they're not buying them to shrink them, they're buying them to grow them. And I think that benefits Kilroy and other that are in our markets because we're seeing increased demand from all those different industries. If we look at the medtech, fintech, autotech, industrial tech, it's explosive. So, I think we're very well-positioned. One thing, back to San Francisco, if I might, Tracy runs our Life Science practice, and if we could talk a little bit about Life Science in San Francisco, the bigger area, what's going on there, because that's quite dynamic as well.</p><p>TRACY MURPHY, EVP, LIFE SCIENCES, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Yes, sure. So we'll start in Seattle kind of work our way down. I think if you look at just basic inventory up close, you'll see 50 million feet of inventory at that specific with Life Science industry, largely controlled by a pretty small group of ownerships, but the vacancy across the board is really, really limited, it's 2%; Seattle, there is largely nothing. The Bay area is very similar with the exception of exchange coming online. Peninsula is drum-tight, there is nowhere to go. So - [build the suites for alumina] and what not. And then, San Diego is a little bit higher, but from a Class A perspective, maybe 6%. So, very limited from a supply perspective.</p><p>The demand trend, Seattle's 500,000 feet, the Bay Area is 2 million feet, absorption in both of kind of record years for three years running, San Diego Life Sciences kind of outperformed office pretty consistently year-over-year. So from demand and supply perspective, the Life Science industry has been just the strong similar to tech?</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Are any of the potential changes to visa policy impactful to either Life Science or tech in the Bay Area and elsewhere?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Yes. You don't answer that question as we ask all of our technology clients and friends. And I think everybody is worried about it. I obviously don't have any inside information there, but if we take a look at the demand and the execution of expansions, sort of going on up and down these areas by the technology companies, I can't see any -- I've seen a speed up or an increase in activity, not the slowdown. So, I haven't seen it in our sphere. It's a real issue. I mean, if they really were to say, you can't work here with these visas, there was a lot of people that contribute mightily to the prowess of our technology industry and what they do around the world and I think it would be a crazy thing to implement, but who knows. We're not seeing anything on the ground.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Anyone in the room. There's a question here in slido, please address Measure S in Los Angeles and why Kilroy involved as a contributor to the anti-group trying to defeat it?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: What?</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Measure S and why you want to defeat it?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well. It's very bad policy in our view, but Los Angeles is like a lot of cities, the Los Angelenos and various areas are frustrated with traffic and frustrated with bigger buildings and all those kinds of things. And Los Angeles frankly has not done a good job over the years with its landing policy. They've done many things that are sort of ad hoc by special permits and whatnot. And understandably citizens are upset and they don't have the transportation infrastructure, although it's improving. So people have been --, they've had a longer commute whatnot, so this is a reflection of that. Every project that we've done in Los Angeles have been approved and most everybody else's projects are in litigation and now we have this major and I'm not going to comment much further, but I think it's bad policy.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: And then sticking to LA. Give us an update on what you're thinking there and what your next projects are going to be?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, I'm not going to tell you what our next projects are going to be other than the ones we've been identified in our supplemental for obvious reasons, but we recently received approval from the city on the academy projects as you know in Hollywood. We have Sunset Media Center, which is about 400,000 odd feet of building we bought, renovated, its 100% leased, rents have gone up -- just skyrocketed there. We recently completed Columbia Square and Viacom has moved in with their consolidation of VH1, Black Entertainment, MTV and Comedy Central, et cetera. [Movie] House moved into the historic phase, Fender Guitars moved into their corporate headquarters and worldwide showroom; and then variety of other people in the fashion industry and entertainment industry and movie industry and so forth have moved into the El Centro building. The apartment complex that we finished there is a 21-storey, very luxurious product. We're getting rents anywhere from $5 to over $10 per square foot per month. So, I think we're setting some records there. We're ahead of schedule on lease up. We have a little bit more leasing in the office to go and then, after that we have the Academy.</p><p>So, the Academy is aside a full city block, just a few blocks away from Columbia Square that is adjacent to the headquarters for the Academy of Motion Pictures. We bought that from them. That project is approximately $400 million project, which involves -- Michelle, help me out on this, about 30,000 square feet of retail, 230 apartment units and how many square feet of office?</p><p>MICHELLE NGO, SVP &amp; TREASURER, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: About 280.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: About 280,000 square feet of office. And we think that'll do very well, given the demand we're seeing in the marketplace. So if you look at our near-term development pipeline, we've a billion underway right now with exchange 100 Hooper in the first phase, which is retail and the first phase of apartments that -- down San Diego. If you think about the next tranche of developments likely to happen will be 333 Dexter, which is about a 700,000 square foot, roughly $400 million project in South Lake Union, where there is 0% vacancy. And then, Academy, which is roughly $400 million, which is in Hollywood. And then, we have a tranche development that we're working on beyond that.</p><p>So the markets that we have, we're seeing improvement in all of our markets at different rates. We're seeing big tech continue to expand and all of our markets, including San Diego, which has been a nice thing to say. And I'm feeling pretty good about the way we're positioned. If you think about Kilroy for a second, we have a best-in-class balance sheet. We have the best-in-class assets. We have a 10-year average age of the assets in the Company. We have a best-in-class development platform. We're Number 1 in North America, three years running at sustainability. We're Number 1 in wellness.</p><p>I think we're really well positioned in our markets for some significant growth. And I mentioned that we thought it would probably double over the next roughly seven years. So, let me give you some quick numbers. At the end of 2016, our annualized stabilized portfolio cash NOI was $458 million, just with the completion of Columbia Square, a little building in the heights where we just saw some additional leases and the Columbia Square Residential, that's an additional $30 million in NOI. It won't be completely exchanged. The projects that are under construction right now, the exchange 100 Hooper where we did the deal with Adobe in the first phase of One Paseo, that's another $70 million. In the end longer out over the next five or six years, 333 Dexter, the Academy, the second and third phases of One Paseo, 9455 Towne Centre, which is a San Diego, which is [$110] million life science project, in the Flower Mart that's roughly another $236 million. That takes you to tighter roughly $800 plus million and then if you include over that period, the current mark-to-market, we're roughly 17% as a portfolio below current market, that's about another $60 million. So we have no future acquisitions with no development -- what I've mentioned, it's about a doubt we project roughly a doubling of today's NOI. Obviously, we're going to do more development. Obviously, we're going to do the acquisitions as that makes sense. And so we think we've set the table for some pretty strong growth over the next several years.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Tyler what's the cost on the projects that John, just went through, if you have it?</p><p>TYLER ROSE, CFO, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: We're including under construction a little over $4 billion and $4.5 billion. We've spend about $1 billion of that, so that's completes about $3 plus billion of fund. We've $500 million to $600 million with the bank, so that leaves $3.5 billion over the next several year and we'll fund that as we normally do with the combination of disposition, debt (technical difficulty) if necessary. But we have plenty of that capacity right now. As John said, we're 25% less to market cap or debt to EBITDA (technical difficulty), so we have plenty of them (technical difficulty).</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Yes. Those are the dispositions you think those will be full stakes or more JVs and just hit the button on the mic when you speak to people --.</p><p>TYLER ROSE: Sorry, go back to John.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: (Multiple speakers).</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Okay, what was the questions.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: The question was, Tyler mentioned dispositions, you've done both JVs and full stake divestitures, which way would you lean on those?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We added our first venture this last year strategically, because it's nice to have that arrow in the quiver. We obviously have investment grade credit rating. We have essentially no -- very little secured debt. We have no short-term debt. We have nothing out of our line of credit. So we have all our options, we're going to keep our options open. You saw us do at $250 million stock issuance, sorry -- $310 million earlier this year. And that just kept our leverage at the very low places was that and I thought that was the right thing to do, even though it was arguably dilutive because we have cash in the bank. We're going to continue to be very conservative. If you think of now, we have a chart here that -- you can see, the people can't see that it might be listing and it's us and all of our peers, and we're at the far left on debt-to-EBITDA and on debt to enterprise value. I could see migrating a little bit to the right. We will not get on the right side of this, that's where I think people go crazy. And I would say this, I think I'm probably the oldest person in this room, I want you to bet that.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Steven, how old are you?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: So, I will say this. Most of the companies I've seen in our industry that have wrecked themselves, it's been on the shovels of debt. They've been boats that just hit upon the rocks. And my view is we want to stay with low leverage to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that we see, not get wild and crazy. And that's what you've seen with Kilroy, that's what you're going to see with Kilroy. We're not going to do exotic, weird things to make money.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: HPP recently bought another studio property. Is that something interested you, is that thing you looked at?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: No comment.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Do you like the studio business overall?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Do I like what?</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: The studio business?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: No comment. If I like that, we'd be in it.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Then, why is there no comment?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, I thought I give you a comment just because everybody else looked so eager. I think Victor's done a very good job. He understands business and so forth. I wish him all the luck in the world. He's a very good operator, got a great company. It's not been the thing that we've been focused on.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: A couple of questions here from the web. Coming back to the exchange, is there any chance of reviving the deal with original tenant that you were in discussions with. Now, I don't know if this was the original-original tenant or the most recent original tenants. And so, how you want to answer?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I think the folks that we were recently had the letter of intent with in negotiating the lease and so forth, are a very big player in that marketplace. This is very strategic to them. They have their own issues. They could come back, I don't know. But I'm not going to count out. My attitude is we got plenty of people that we can fill up the space with, that are excellent credit, excellent companies. And we were at the point where we looked at the project will be delivered the core and shell in what -- Tracy, roughly a year? And our intent is to have it is close to fully committed by that time as we possibly can.</p><p>I said to the market that I don't want to end up with massive amounts of spec development. We have One Paseo, we have a couple $100 million underway, you don't pre-lease the retail and the resi. We've the exchange underway, just like I said, with the 100 Hooper, that we would start it when we had either the exchange further along or with -- significantly see a 100 Hooper. So this is the time to be starting construction at 333 Dexter up in Seattle, South Lake Union, given the state of that market. This is probably the time to be starting the academy. But we don't have to do everything all at once. The markets are good and I just would rather take some chips off the table, so to speak. I should point out about Seattle, that something that I think is worthy and most of people in this room are on the call, would like to understand is in South Lake Union, we were very active. We've recently announced a big deal with Amazon. We're going to be announcing the name of the tenant, although I can't quite yet for another deal we're doing there. But that market had 4 million square feet around numbers of spec development underway a couple years ago, so 100% leased.</p><p>In the neighboring right next door, Denny Regrade had roughly 600,000 square feet of the spec in the last six months, 100% leased. In Bellevue, we had three projects, 1.5 million square feet that was spec office space, and it's all leased. Microsoft just renewed a number of leases in other buildings they occupy in Bellevue. One of the tenets that we thought was going to move out of one of our buildings under 180,000 feet (inaudible), instead extended and the remaining 100,000 feet that we have available over the next several years is all under negotiation. So that marketplace up there is about a strong as it gets. And what we're seeing is the technology companies move into that area those are there expand in that area, obviously that creates a virtuous cycle where the support companies, -- the fire category company grow, there's other dynamics that are happening there. We're seeing the same thing at San Francisco, we're seeing the same thing in Hollywood, we're seeing the same thing in West LA and we're seeing it all be it a lower growth rate in San Diego and those are our markets and -- I think it's -- I want to say that I think everybody knows that I've commented over the years that I don't like what's going on internationally. I will make a comment about the state of our politics and the parties because that would be inappropriate, but this scares the hell out of me. So the way we deal with it, is get a lot of pre-leasing done, keep a balance sheet as very sane and manage our exploration. So, when I think of companies do that they'll find that they'll move very nicely over the next decade or so.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: And that's a good place to state what it is. Next question, you were very early to San Francisco and Seattle, which markets can we expect Kilroy to move next?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: No comment. You've seen a shift more into the Life Science now, we've announced that, but I'm not going to tell competitors what we're doing.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: And by the power of the internet, the question I asked you earlier was the original-original tenant was the question on the exchange?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I mean, the first one was the VA and the last one you can figure out who was our major tenant in South San Francisco or in Mission Bay.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Any questions in the room? If we think about the Hollywood, your multifamily, are you going to keep that?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We have optionality. I like optionality. If you think about it, not everybody, but most every apartment developer of private or public wanted to buy that pad just as they want to buy the past for the 630 or so units down at One Paseo. We work for the shareholders. We brought in the expertise to do both resi and limited retail and whatnot, and now, Life Science in a greater way. We've developed them the great returns. They are fantastic products that are sort of irreplaceable. We have total optionality. We can venture the whole project. We could fetch from the retail. We can sell not the retail, but resi. We can finance it, we can sell it, we can do whatever we want. Look, more to come.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Just going back to the Flower Mart, can you -- and you might have mentioned this earlier, can we just go through the milestones that we should look for timing wise, entitlements, just over the next year or two, just landmarks?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Is that mean, we're over or what?</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: That means we've got five left.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Means what? Five minutes, okay, great. I wondered what that was. The Flower Mart's 2.3 million square feet around -- I mentioned and we're going through the entitlement process now. The City has made available to us location to relocate the Flower Mart. They view that as a very strategic and very important component of San Francisco as part of the fabric of the community. They're working with us on the entitlements. And I don't want to get into much more detail than that, but I think we could be under construction, again subject to all the forces that we look at the market, the macro and all the rest. Maybe as early as 2.5 years, it's probably a 2.5-year construction.</p><p>And it probably get build in two phases, one would be roughly -- the last phase would probably be about 300,000 feet of office, so call that round numbers, just rounding it up, just shy of 300 million. The project is plus -- I mean, we're calling it roughly $2 billion, whether that's a $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion, so the balance would be in the first phase, which would include all of the subterranean parking. By the way, we've got extraordinary amount of parking because of the Flower Mart there. We were able to get -- most buildings don't get parking or get very limited parking. I think we are getting 750 parking stalls there, if I'm not mistaken. And then that would include roughly a $1.7 million in office space, 125,000 square feet of market hall retail and 125,000 square feet of Flower Mart.</p><p>One of things we've done in that project, we've been talking a lot with our technology clients, I'm not going to name the names that are looking at the Flower Mart as a place where they can really be in the city and scale and be able to scale up. To give you an idea the magnitude to do this thing it's almost -- it's approximately 7.5 acres. The floor plates, the buildings are vertical, but they're interconnected horizontally, so in the lower levels they go up to a 125,000 square feet, 15 feet clear opening onto terrace gardens that has over 3.5 acres of rooftop decks, has over an acre and a half of open space on the ground plane. So it's a project of significant scale. We've integrated into it and we're working with. We haven't completely finalized it yet. How automated cars will flow through the property, how a private bus service and so forth -- in San Francisco, you have a lot of buses that move people back and forth between the valley and the city and so forth. And there is always this antagonism between some of the activists who don't like the private company buses using the public company bus stops. To me it's insane, but that's the way some people think. So, we've said, okay, let's get the public company shuttles and whatnot off the public right away, putting right into project. So, we are thinking about this project is really a project for the future. It will be as close to LEED Platinum as we can, (inaudible) we've now done, completed the secondly platinum building in the city, the only to LEED Platinum ground up buildings; the third was underway right now over 100 -- over to exchange; and the fourth one is underway at 100 Hooper, our goal in the Flower Mart is that it will not only be LEED Platinum, it will hit the well category and it will have all the bells and whistles that the modern technology company needs in order to move their people around accommodate them and to minimize the impact right away in the community. So, we're pretty excited about this thing. We're in the final process of selecting who the broker or brokers will be for the project. The number of ideas that we've gotten through that process has been remarkable. The number of ideas we're getting from our tenant base are remarkable. I mean, it's really a collaborative effort amd I'm really excited about this project because it's the right kind of product and it has the right kind of scale or right kind of amenities, and all the different things that people want. And it's coming on stream right -- there are quite a few people that needs some big expansion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Technical Difficulty).</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I got 8 seconds.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Yes, and you've got three questions to answer. So, what was same-store NOI growth be for the office sector overall in 2018?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I don't know. Based on what I've seen, maybe 3%.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: How much higher or lower do you expect private market cap rates for office to be in 12 months?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: That's a big question because it's across all office. So, maybe it backs off 50 basis points, particularly on the --</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: 50 or 15? 50?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: 50, yes.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Rank the best real estate decisions to make today buy, build, sell?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Develop, sell, buy.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA: On today's show, kicked out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THERESA MAY, BRITISH <person><nameText>PRIME MINISTER</nameText></person>: This is the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA: More than 20 nations have expelled Russian diplomats, including the United States which gave the boot to the largest number of Russian envoys since the Cold war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But is this the right strategy with Moscow?</p><p>And Kim comes out of North Korea. What to make of the leader's trip this week to China. And his recent charm offensive. I have a great panel to discuss it all.</p><p>And --</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've got the greatest economy maybe ever.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Is he right? And could it all be jeopardized by a trade war? I'll ask Steve Rattner and Rana Faroohar.</p><p>Also, the other technology revolution that the world needs to pay attention to. How getting hundreds of millions of people online in India is changing that nation and might change the world.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: But first, here's \"My Take.\" In order to explain some of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>bizarre foreign policy moves, we're often told that he is unconventional and that this could well be an asset. Well, it's certainly true he doesn't follow standard operating procedure on almost anything from getting daily briefings to staffing the State Department. But his most striking departure from previous presidents has been his rhetoric.</p><p>American presidents have tended to weigh their words carefully, believing that they must preserve the credibility of the world's leading power. And then there is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for whom words are weightless. During the campaign, he excoriated Saudi Arabia as a country that wants women as slaves and to kill gays only to make his first presidential trip abroad to the kingdom and warmly embrace its rulers. He said NATO was obsolete and then simply affirmed the opposite.</p><p>There are situations where such flexibility might work. On North Korea Trump threatened to rain fire and fury on the country, only now to welcome a meeting with its leader. Trump supporters say this is just the kind of maneuvering that could well produce a deal that has eluded more conventional approaches to the problem.</p><p>We should all hope that it will. So far though it's worth noting that the circus-like atmosphere of Trump's alternating threats and embraces has obscured a key point. It is Trump who has made the concessions, not Kim Jong-un.</p><p>The American position has long been that until North Korea took some concrete steps toward denuclearization, there would be no talks. Until recently the Trump administration itself insisted that it would not reward the nuclear buildup with negotiations.</p><p>Now there's a good argument to be flexible on this procedural issue, but we should be aware that so far Kim Jong-un seems to be executing a smart strategy brilliantly. He embarked on a fast track buildup, creating a genuine nuclear arsenal with missiles that can deliver the weapons around the world. He risked tensions with the world and even his relations with China.</p><p>Now with the arsenal built, he's mending relations with China, reaching out to South Korea and offering to negotiate with Washington.</p><p>Trump's skill here might well be his willingness to abandon totally a passive position and fully endorse a new one. The United States after all will have to accept something less than its long declared goal, the complete denuclearization of North Korea, and maybe Trump will be able to find some way to sell this.</p><p>There is, however, a different kind of tough talk that is more worrying. The Trump administration pushes hard on some issues, trade with South Korea for example, then announces a deal claiming to have won significant concessions. In fact, most of these have been symbolic concessions made by allies to allow the administration to save face.</p><p>South Korea, for example, agreed to raise the number of cars each American auto manufacturer can sell in the country from 25,000 to 50,000. It's an easy concession to make. No American company sold even 11,000 cars there last year.</p><p>See, America remains a super power. Its allies search for ways to accommodate it. The Trump administration can keep making outlandish demands and it will obtain some concessions because no one wants an open breach with the United States. If Trump says the Europeans have to come up with some changes to the Iran deal, maybe they will find some way to do so because they don't want to see the deal collapse and they don't want to see the West fall into disarray.</p><p>This is not a sign of power but rather the abuse of power.</p><p>[10:05:02] When the Bush administration forced a series of countries to support the Iraq war, this did not signal American strength, it actually sapped that strength. The United States has built up its credibility and political capital over the last century. The Trump administration is raiding that trust fund for short-term political advantages and in ways that will permanently deplete it.</p><p>For more, go to CNN.com/fareed and read my \"Washington Post\" column this week. And let's get started.</p><p>On Monday, an old-fashioned dark green train with yellow stripes pulled into a station in Beijing. Who was in the train was for a time the week's biggest mystery. Then turned into the week's biggest surprise. It was, of course, Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader was on an unannounced visit to Beijing. His first known trip outside the hermit kingdom since he took power in 2011.</p><p>What to make of the trip, the meetings with Chinese President Xi And Kim's broader charm offensive. Well, I have a great panel to discuss.</p><p>Anne-Marie Slaughter is the president and CEO of the think tank New America, the author of the \"Chess Board and the Web.\" Richard Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of \"A World in Disarray.\" The two of them both former directors of policy planning at the State Department.</p><p>Also with us is Walter Russell Knead, a professor of Foreign Affairs and Humanities at Bart College and a columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>Anne-Marie, what do you make of Kim Jong-un's strategy, the trip to Beijing? I mean, it all seems pretty well-thought through.</p><p>ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NEW AMERICA: Well, he certainly managed to keep himself at the center of things, directing both Olympic diplomacy and now again on stage. I actually think, though, this visit may have had more to do with <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>than Kim Jong-un in the sense that immediately after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>announced that there was going to be a meeting, he received a call from <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>and the Chinese are saying you're not going to make any deals without us at the table. And it's reasonable to think they similarly wanted to make that very clear to the North Koreans.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you think, Richard, that the United States has a strategy here? Because, I mean, for the longest time it said we're not going to talk until you do something concrete. Now they say we'll talk. Is there a plan?</p><p>RICHARD HAASS, PRESIDENT, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Well, there doesn't seem to be. You know, the one thing you constantly hear is we're demanding denuclearization but nobody has defined it. And if you could define it, it might take 20 odd years to bring it about. It's also not clear that we're prepared to do in exchange for whatever definition of denuclearization we decide is adequate.</p><p>The biggest question, Fareed, is whether we're prepared to take half a loaf. Even if somewhere down the road the North Koreans might agree to give up their nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles which I think is unlikely, what about our interim agreement?</p><p>And the irony is, here's an administration that's going to war potentially against the interim agreement with Iran and sometime this May has to decide what it's going to do but the only realistic path for diplomatic success at this summit if in fact it were to happen with North Korea might be some type of an interim agreement where North Korea would agree to extend its freeze on testing in exchange for what? And that's the big question facing the administration.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So, Walter, you are regarded as a kind of a Trump whisperer because the book you wrote and the idea of a Jackson-ian foreign policy is often seen as inspiring Trump, whether, you know, I assume subconsciously. I assume he's not read the 650-page book.</p><p>WALTER RUSSELL MEAD, PROFESSOR OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HUMANITIES, BART COLLEGE: I'm sure he's it memorized it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ZAKARIA: But the really interesting question, you do seem to get at -- you understand the instincts. Is Trump the kind of guy who can do what Richard said? Which is after having said we're going to rain fire and fury on him, say, yes, this is a pretty good deal, it's not the best but we can live with it, and, you know -- and then sell it to a base that also is very unilateralist and Jackson-ian.</p><p>MEAD: I -- you know, it is actually interesting that Andrew Jackson who was probably a better read president maybe than <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>but shared some of these instincts and political base did, in fact, as president have to pursue a more moderate than expected foreign policy. One of the big issues was the French were reneging on an agreement to repay some debts to the U.S. Jackson mobilized the fleet and started sending this -- you know, the relatively small American Navy across the Atlantic. The French agreed to pay, but it was kind of a compromised settlement. Jackson embraced it immediately.</p><p>So yes, one of the things about Jackson-ian leadership is an agreement that they would never buy from Obama, they might buy from Trump. Sort of a Nixon to China kind of thing. Now whether Trump will do this, that's a whole different question, but structurally, yes, it could happen.</p><p>[10:10:08] ZAKARIA: Richard, you made a point in a tweet, which I thought was very interesting and important, which is John Bolton, the new National Security adviser, has been threatening war against North Korea. And it's important to understand that what he's talking about is not a preemptive war but a preventive war, that is to say an unprovoked war against North Korea which has not in some ways struck or is planning to strike the United States.</p><p>Do you think even leaving that out there, without him publicly walking that back, is dangerous?</p><p>HAASS: I don't know if it's dangerous since rhetorically it's part of the backdrop to negotiations and it might conceivably push the Chinese to use slightly more influence with the North Koreans. But what John Bolton wrote is flat-out wrong. He confused specifically at the risk of losing your viewership preemptive and preventative strikes and he confused the difference between an imminent threat, which North Korea does impose, and a gathering threat.</p><p>And under international law, to simply go after gathering threats, well, we didn't do it against the Soviet Union or China. We did, we told the Soviets not to do it against China in the late '60s. A world of those kinds of strikes would be a world at constant war. So if this ever were actually to be affected, to happen, this would cause an enormous war and again we would find ourselves isolated. So I'm hoping it's nothing more than rhetoric. But indeed I think there are people including John Bolton who could well believe in this.</p><p>ZAKARIA: You mentioned something which I want to come back to, which is that this is a bilateral summit. So far the United States has always tried to do something about North Korea the way it has done something with Iran which is to get everybody at the table because everyone has a stake, the Russians, the Chinese, the South Koreans. Is this creative diplomacy to try a bilateral or is it a mistake? Should we have included everybody at the table?</p><p>SLAUGHTER: It's better when we're coordinated. I mean, we -- we need the Chinese. We need the Japanese. And in general, our approach has been we don't sell out our allies. Now that is not something that Trump is worried about. He's perfectly willing to sell out our allies, at least rhetorically but I don't think we had a thought-out strategy again there.</p><p>I think this appeals absolutely to Trump's desire to be center stage, to be having, you know, a big win. You know my hard-nosed North Korean diplomacy brought him to the table. He has a real advantage in playing up this until it actually happens and then who knows what he might give away. But I don't think it's strategically for us in Asia it's a good idea for us to be there with the North Koreans alone. It also gives Kim Jong-un unbelievable prestige which suits him perfectly but doesn't suit us.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Fascinating.</p><p>All right. When we come back, next on GPS, another major foreign policy challenge. This week the West responds to Russia. Sanctions and forced diplomatic departures. Is that the right way to fight Moscow? We'll discuss when we come back.</p><p>[10:17:29] ZAKARIA: Persona non grata, that is Latin for unwelcomed person and it's the label that the State Department put on 60 Russian diplomats on Monday when the U.S. ordered them to leave the country. On Thursday Russia retaliated with a tit-for-tat. PNG, as foreign policy wonks call it, 60 Americans. Later in the week Moscow similarly retaliated against some of the more than 20 other countries that had kicked Russian diplomats out.</p><p>The question remains, do these diplomatic expulsions make any difference?</p><p>Back with me, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Richard Haass, and Walter Russell Mead.</p><p>Richard, you're old enough you went through this during the Cold War. There was a very good piece, I can't remember by whom, who said this is sort of very old-fashioned tit-for-tat, it makes no sense, it actually puts the U.S. at a disadvantage because the Russians expelled a few intelligence officers that the West has in Russia whereas America and the West are open societies, much easier to recruit and find information out. So why do it?</p><p>HAASS: Look, the fact that we pushed back in concert with our allies was in principle good, in practice this was the wrong move. It was totally predictable, once we kicked out their 60 odd diplomats they were going to do exactly the same thing. So now what do we do? They were the ones who provoked this by the attempted murder of two individuals in the U.K.</p><p>I would have much preferred an approach at the Russians (INAUDIBLE), say go after them economically, go after certain financial institutions, go after their ability to operate in the Western financial system. That would have been an asymmetrical response. They couldn't have retaliated in kind. Now the question is what do we do next at a time? I was just in Moscow. There's almost no U.S.- Russian relationship. There are no diplomats. There hasn't been a congressional delegation in five years.</p><p>We need more substance to this relationship. There's less now than there was at the worst moment in the Cold War. So I don't think diplomatic ousters, balanced or imbalanced, serve either side's interest.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Ann-Marie, a lot of people think that the reason we don't rule out economically is there is still that lingering question of whether the Kremlin has some economic information, ties to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Do you think that plays a part?</p><p>SLAUGHTER: I don't think that played a part in this immediate response, in part because it's driven by the British and what the British decided to do. And I understand Richard's point that this may seem to be cutting off your nose despite your diplomatic face, but it is the way the game is played. It is the natural first start. You know, when somebody is murdering people in your country, the first thing you do is to downgrade relations with them.</p><p>[10:20:05] And what is impressive to me is that so many Europeans followed suit because that was not a given, particularly at a time when Britain is leaving the EU. It was not clear that Germany and France and most other big European countries and small ones would say you've gone too far. So I see this as an important first step. I don't think it goes far enough, and I actually think what we do need to do is go after the assets of sort of ill-gotten gains by various Russian oligarchs. But I think it is an important first step.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you think, Walter, that this is the new normal for relations with Russia? I mean, as Richard said, at this point we're in a kind of -- there were many points during the Cold War where we had better relations with Russia and it does seem the Trump administration is sort of frozen. It can't make overtures because that raises suspicions. It doesn't want to be too hard lined. So again here there seems to be no American policy towards Russia, just a series of reflexes in, you know, in this case mirroring what the British did.</p><p>MEAD: I think it's important to understand it from the Russian point of view, our policy is actually quite anti-Russian in the sense that fracking is destroying one element of Putin's power by reducing the price of energy, that a big military buildup and modernization of the nuclear arsenal are all the kinds of things that weaken Russia's position in ways it can't do very much about.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Add to that sanctions and you're weakening your financial power.</p><p>MEAD: Right. Exactly. So -- you know, so the idea that we could put a smiley face on all of that and have a great relationship I think is wrong. I think Trump, like his predecessors, like Obama and like Bush, both thought, OK, I can magically make the relationship good. I have the qualities, unlike my foolish predecessor, to have a terrific Russia policy.</p><p>The reset didn't work. Bush soul gaze didn't work. Cannon actually said years ago that the problems with U.S.-Russian relations are structural. And what's interesting to me is at the end of the Cold War everybody said, oh, that Cannon, what a genius. But then everybody forgot that he said our problem is not really that they're communist so much is that they're Russian. So boy, they're not communist now, no more Russia-U.S. problems.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And then you're right, since Clinton actually, the solution has always been psychological.</p><p>MEAD: Yes.</p><p>ZAKARIA: I will have a better relationship with the guy at the top.</p><p>MEAD: Right.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And the structural --</p><p>MEAD: Which is exactly what Cannon was telling us would never work. It's fascinating. Actually, as a writer, it's incredibly depressing that the most influential essay in the history of American foreign policy essentially has no influence.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Final thought.</p><p>HAASS: This relationship has essentially been deinstitutionalized. And the fact that we still have nuclear weapons, both of us, enormous amounts being modernized, we see what the Russians are doing in Europe -- have done in Syria. So I don't think either side is served by the current state of affairs. But the kind of auto pilot foreign policy, kick out diplomats, that to me is a mindless response.</p><p>What we've got to do is a much more targeted response, be tougher with them, yet also find a way to talk to them. And we need to basically be able to manage both sides of this relationship at once.</p><p>ZAKARIA: All right. We got to go.</p><p>Next on GPS, Trump and trade. Is he starting a global economic war. Steve Rattner and Rana Faroohar join me when we return.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[10:27:26] TRUMP: We've got the greatest economy maybe ever, maybe in history. We have the greatest economy we've ever had.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZAKARIA: A bold claim from <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>on Thursday in Ohio. Can he back it up and what would happen to that greatest economy if a global trade war starts?</p><p>Joining me now, Rana Faroohar, global business columnist and associate editor for the \"FT\" and CNN's global economic analyst, and Steve Rattner who was President Obama's car czar and is now the chairman and CEO of Willet Advisers.</p><p>Steve, at the risk of agreeing with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>not on that boast but --</p><p>STEVE RATTNER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, WILLET ADVISERS LLC: Almost isn't true as you know.</p><p>ZAKARIA: On the trade issue, isn't it right that China has basically been a mercantilist cheater in a global trade system and taking advantage of the open trading system?</p><p>RATTNER: It is absolutely right and it is something that people say and it's been surprising to me in the last week or so since all this started how many people say, you know, I don't like the way Trump does it and this and that, but he's not wrong. I've spent a lot of time in China over the last 10 years. It is the most mercantilist, the most protectionist, the most flagrant abuser of rules but they're abusing nontariff barriers, not tariff barriers. And so I think our response wasn't exactly the right response but the problem is very real.</p><p>ZAKARIA: What do you -- you know, there's always this view that in trade wars everyone loses. So what do you do?</p><p>RATTNER: I think the way that we should handle it, it should have been started a long time ago, would have been as a global effort among -- look, Europe worries as much about China as we do. Other developed countries worry about China. Even underdeveloped countries worry about China. We should have gotten the world together and taken on the Chinese through diplomacy over a much longer period of time.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And that's why it seemed to me the steel tariffs were bizarre, Rana.</p><p>RANA FAROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Yes.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Because they seemed to initially affect -- I mean, our biggest steel imports come from South Korea, and Germany, and Canada and Mexico, not from China.</p><p>FAROOHAR: Absolutely. And that's what makes you so worried about this trade action. It feels like the president just got up and kind of thought of something in the morning, tweeted it out and didn't really look at the implications. I think that the lessons, interestingly, that we need to take from China are think long term. You know and China is true, China's trade practices are unfair.</p><p>What they do well is they plan for the long term. They have an industrial strategy and industrial policy. Actually that's something a lot of European nations have as well. And what the president should be doing is thinking regionally, thinking about how to get closer to Canada, Mexico, how to create the kind of synergies that are in that block and may be appropriate for this period in time.</p><p>ZAKARIA: You wrote a column which struck me as very, very smart. You just came back from China and you said you were struck by the degree to which the Chinese model is working and the American model is not. Explain what you meant.</p><p>STEVEN RATTNER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, WILLETT ADVISORS LLC: This is the striking thing to me, that China has their vision 2025 program.</p><p>They're -- they want to be national champions in all kinds of industries, including robotics and A.I. and things like that. Obviously, anyone who goes there and you see the subways, you see the infrastructure, you see the skyscrapers.</p><p>And they are moving forward, and they are driving forward using a form of state-directed capitalism different than our system. And we're in gridlock. Nothing is happening in Washington. We can't have -- we don't have any initiatives.</p><p>Perhaps Rana's right, we should be doing it locally, but the contrast between China just driving forward incredibly effectively and us essentially standing still is very striking.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL BUSINESS COLUMNIST AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: You know, I think that this actually picks up on another thread in the news right now which is the correction in the text docs and the way technology is going to roll out.</p><p>There may be a real new regionalism here. I mean, China has made it very clear that they want to be independent of the U.S. technology in the next 10 years. They have their own very large market that, really, I think could be a standalone, high growth market. We need a strategy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And they've blocked American tech companies very successfully.</p><p>FOROOHAR: And they're blocking -- I mean, that is absolutely true. But we don't have a coherent strategy here at home about, you know, what is the digital economy?</p><p>What does it look like? What are the new regulations and policies that should be in place? How should we train up a 21st century workforce?</p><p>We've heard a lot of window dressing about all of these things, and we've seen policies that go in one direction and then lurch in another. But we need a really unified plan if we're going keep up and remain competitive in the highest growth area.</p><p>ZAKARIA: On take that thick bush, do you think -- I mean, to Trump's claim, is the economy -- we are witnessing the deflation of a tech bubble, you think?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I actually think it's a big issue, and I think we may have reached a peak for big tech stocks.</p><p>I think that Europe, for example, is rolling out very interesting new privacy rules in May. They're really looking at, how should we regulate A.I.?</p><p>I mean, artificial intelligence, which is going to account for a lot of growth not just in technology but in most industries going forward, is two things. It's data and it's quantum competing.</p><p>Now, data is the problem, right? When we look at election manipulation and the backlash over Facebook, we have to find a balance between privacy regulation and being able stay ahead in these industries. We need a real national conversation about that.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And it does strike me again, Steve, coming back to your point, we can't get -- we can't pass a budget. We can't make investments in infrastructure. We can't make investments in science.</p><p>Is it possible that the chaotic, open, freewheeling system that America has is just going to underperform?</p><p>RATTNER: This is the big question, Fareed. I think we're actually literally witnessing a test between the liberal democracies that have basically defined the post-World War II order and form of a state- directed capitalism in China. India, obviously, has its own system which is also somewhat different. And we're going to see which one wins.</p><p>But right now -- and there's a whole bunch of books that are coming out on this now. I mean, people are really worried about this, and I'm worried about it.</p><p>Right now, I think you have to, I would argue -- I'm not in favor of giving up my civil liberties, but, on a purely economic basis, I would have to argue that state-directed capitalism is doing a better job than our liberal democracy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: All right. We'll have to come back and talk about this more. Thank you both.</p><p>Next on GPS, just what is the next big technological revolution? It might be happening in one of the world's poorest nations.</p><p>[10:37:49] ZAKARIA: Ask most people to identify the global hub of emerging technology and they'd probably think of Silicon Valley. But in one sense, the biggest leap in technology today is actually happening worlds away from those gleaming office parks. It is in the crowded cities and dusty villages of India.</p><p>I'll give you the numbers. In 2000, India had 10 million Internet users. Last year, it reached 460 million, making it the second largest online user base in the world after China.</p><p>Why is it happening? A smartphone revolution.</p><p>Unlike Americans who had a comparatively slow evolution from dial-up to smartphones, Indians are moving straight to these minicomputers, says the Ravi Agarwal, the former CNN New Delhi bureau chief and author of the forthcoming book, \"India Connected, How the Smartphone is Transforming the World's Largest Democracy.\"</p><p>How did a country with such entrenched poverty where more than 200 million people lack access to even electricity get hundreds of millions online in less than a decade? And how will it get the rest?</p><p>The answer is all about prices. India's market is glutted with cheap phones and cheap data. Smartphone prices have been dropping for years. Now, Indians can buy a basic smartphone for as little as $20.</p><p>And in late 2016, something happened that made data cheaper, a phenomenon that will drive the next generation of online users.</p><p>Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man who runs India's largest company, launched Jio, a network offering 4G voice and data services throughout the country. His company, Reliance, invested an unprecedented $20 billion in the initiative. It announced it would build 45,000 mobile towers.</p><p>And then, for six months, it made unlimited 4G data absolutely free. It was a conscious effort to pull hordes of Indians online, and its effect was revolutionary.</p><p>By the end of 2017, 160 million people had subscribed. Data usage in the country soared, and India surpassed the United States in app downloads, making it second only to China.</p><p>[10:40:10] In September, Ambani noted that India had moved from a lowly 155th in mobile broadband penetration to being the world's largest mobile data-consuming nation. Number one in just one year.</p><p>All of these changes represent huge opportunities for Jio and other companies, but they also have the potential to transform the Internet itself.</p><p>Think of the hundreds of millions of Chinese Internet users and how they changed the nature of e-commerce, created behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent, and have revolutionized finance by creating cheap digital payments far faster than any in the United States.</p><p>Indians might well initiate the next series of transformations because of how this vast user base will use the Internet. Already, the widespread availability of smartphones and government policies have led to a 20-fold increase in online payments in just three years, according to a Mumbai market research firm.</p><p>Smartphones provide education apps for India's aspirational youth. They're also being used to help people compare prices of medicines in a country where most people pay burdensome health expenses out of pocket.</p><p>Now, healthcare and education are fields that could easily get disrupted in the U.S. because of innovations out of India. And all these innovations will have the effect of empowering some of the poorest people on the planet and lifting them out of poverty.</p><p>Next on GPS, how is America today like South Africa during the apartheid era? Amy Chua, the author of the book that brought us the concept of the tiger mom will explain.</p><p>[10:46:01] ZAKARIA: My next guest, Amy Chua, is an author whose books tend to change the conversation.</p><p>She's most famous for her 2011 book \"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.\" That book changed the way many thought about their children and how to raise them. It created a lot of controversies.</p><p>Her new book just may change the way Americans think about themselves. What does it mean to be American and are people here American first? White, Black, Asian or Hispanic first? Working class or liberal elite first?</p><p>Amy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and author of \"Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations.\"</p><p>Welcome back to the show.</p><p>AMY CHUA, AUTHOR, \"POLITICAL TRIBES: GROUP INSTINCT AND THE FATE OF NATIONS\": Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So this really returns you to your first book where you talked about this phenomenon that I think is very important to set out, which is in many developing democracies, you noticed there was this huge problem which was what you called a market-dominant minority. Explain what you meant.</p><p>CHUA: So this phenomenon is actually pervasive in the developing world, and it's completely unknown and uncomfortable for Americans.</p><p>In many developing countries, there is a small ethnic minority viewed as an outsider that controls a vastly disproportionate amount of the nation's wealth.</p><p>For example, the three percent Chinese minority in Indonesia who control about 70 to 80 percent of the private sector in the entire corporate economy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And in Malaysia and Thailand, with similar Chinese minorities.</p><p>CHUA: Exactly. Or even Whites in South Africa. Very different type, right? I mean, that's a former colonizer because of apartheid.</p><p>But again, you know, a 10 to 14 percent minority that controls all of the land, everything. Indians in East Africa, Lebanese in West Africa, Jews in many parts of the world between the first and second world wars in Lithuania.</p><p>ZAKARIA: That was the one Western experience that we know of, the Jews. And what you point out is that in all these cases, you have a real problem with democracy which is that the majority resents them, and of course, the majority has the political power.</p><p>CHUA: Yes. So I have described market-dominant minorities as the Achilles heel of democracy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So now what you have pointed out is that, something you didn't even notice, is you've realized that America actually does have a market-dominant minority that the majority or some large part of the country resent. Who is our market-dominant minority?</p><p>CHUA: This is a new development, and it really makes sense of everything that's going on in our country. People just -- I think they misdiagnose the problem. They hurl big terms, racism, White supremacy.</p><p>So two things have happened. First of all, with this massive demographic change in this country, Whites are on the verge of losing their majority status. So by 2044, Whites may no longer be a majority.</p><p>This means everybody's threatened now. You know, it's not just the minorities who feel threatened. Whites feel threatened. Sixty-seven percent of working class Whites feel that there is more discrimination against Whites than minorities.</p><p>At the same time, something else has happened which is that class or, really, education has split America's White majority. So what we might loosely call coastal elites or coastal Whites, their resentment against the Whites in Trump's base, basically, in this -- in the middle of the country, there is so much mutual antagonism and resentment.</p><p>I have studied ethnicity for 20 years. It's almost like an ethnic divide, Fareed, because all the markers are there.</p><p>They're insular. The two groups actually do not intermarry. They speak differently. We have a politically -- we know how to speak politically correctly. So in my analysis --</p><p>ZAKARIA: And in a way, what you describe is, really, as you say, it's two worlds, one of which is coastal or big city, educated --</p><p>CHUA: Yes, multi-cultural.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Multi-cultural. And these people are separating themselves from the rest of the country.</p><p>[10:50:01] The part that I find interesting, it seems to me, is this is seen as a meritocracy. Right, of the merit-based system of education?</p><p>So I think the people at the top, the people who are the coastal elites, think that this is not ethnicity. This is entirely justified elitism because --</p><p>CHUA: And it used to be. I even --</p><p>ZAKARIA: -- they did better on the SATs.</p><p>CHUA: It used to be that way, but what's happened in the last 50 years is there is much less social mobility. Education has gone wrong.</p><p>I mean, it used to be that engine where people could climb. Now, with the tutors, it's so expensive. You know, people from the -- a middle class or lower class, you know, family in Ohio can't easily make it.</p><p>And there's a racial and ethnic element too that's very coded. You know, when people say, let's make America great again, what's happening is a lot of people in the middle of the country, they see coastal elites as minority loving.</p><p>They love immigrants. They're always trying to help people in other developing countries. They don't care about real Americans.</p><p>And in a way, it's a perfect parallel to, you know, we need Serbia for the Serbs. You know, Bolivia for the indigenous, real Bolivians.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Right.</p><p>CHUA: Zimbabwe for the Black Zimbabweans. And we had our own version of that, and you really see that's the kind of zero-sum political tribalism that we're in right now.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So now here is the hard part. How do you -- what do you do about it? Because as I see it, it seems like these two groups are actually separating even more. CHUA: I think, you know, we were playing with fire. I think progressives didn't realize that this identity mongering and victim worshipping wouldn't just take over college campuses but would actually help <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>get elected.</p><p>And on the right, I think a lot of conservatives didn't quite realize that this conspiracy theory peddling and rage mongering wouldn't just, you know, be on conservative radio but, again, would help <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>get elected.</p><p>So I think we all need to elevate ourselves and remember what makes us special so that, right now, we're in a situation that we can't have. We now view people who voted on the other side as our enemies. I mean, as immoral, inferior people and not as fellow Americans.</p><p>So I think that's -- but I think we're going to get there. I actually think in 2018 and 2020, that the messaging will be different on both sides. I think it's a bit of a wake-up call.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Amy Chua, always a pleasure to have you.</p><p>CHUA: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>[10:56:56] ZAKARIA: Voters in Hungary are headed to the polls next Sunday, and the Fidesz Party of far-right <person><nameText>Prime Minister </nameText></person>Viktor Orban is widely expected to secure victory.</p><p>This would be the third consecutive term and the fourth overall for Orban, a populist who is openly hostile toward immigrants and the European Union.</p><p>It brings me to my question. His party has made demonizing which American figure a central part of its strategy? Is it Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg, Barack Obama, or George Soros?</p><p>Stay tuned and we'll tell you the correct answer.</p><p>My book of the week is \"The Ordinary Virtues: Moral Order in a Divided World\" by Michael Ignatieff, a philosopher and former Canadian politician.</p><p>Ignatieff asks a simple question, is globalization bringing us together or tearing us apart?</p><p>He answers it by taking us around the world from Bosnia to Brazil, South Africa to Myanmar. The result is a fascinating and deeply engaging book.</p><p>And now for the last look. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>accepted Kim Jong-un's invitation to meet face to face, and the White House made it clear that its goal is denuclearization of North Korea. But before celebrating, we should ask, is denuclearization a realistic objective?</p><p>Well, it's occurred in the past but only four times. In three of these cases, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, the states inherited their nuclear weapons from the USSR and gave them up following the Soviet collapse in 1991. They neither developed the weapons located in their territory nor had the wherewithal to maintain them.</p><p>According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, only one nation has ever dismantled a nuclear arsenal it had developed itself. South Africa.</p><p>Like North Korea today, in the 1970s, South Africa was an isolated pariah state afraid for its security and decided to pursue nuclear weapons. It ultimately produced six uranium warheads.</p><p>However, by 1989, the end of the Angolan War and the general decline of world communism led South Africa's leader, F.W. de Klerk, to conclude that nuclear arms were no longer necessary.</p><p>And with apartheid ending, he wanted to send a signal that South Africa was becoming an upright, global citizen. He ordered the nuclear arsenal destroyed and signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In 1996, South Africa signed the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free- Zone Treaty.</p><p>As world leaders try to persuade Pyongyang to denuclearize, they would do well to study Pretoria's example. After all, it's the only one we have.</p><p>The answer to my GPS Challenge question this week, D, <person><nameText>Prime Minister </nameText></person>Viktor Orban has vilified Hungarian-American investor George Soros and his support for pro-democracy and civil society groups in Hungary.</p><p>A particular target for Orban has been Soros' Central European University, even though hosting this modern internationally ranked center for social sciences seems like a big win for Hungary as a whole. Though Budapest denies it, the campaign against Soros does smack of anti-Semitism.</p><p>[11:00:01] Thanks to all of you for being part of my program this week. I will see you next week.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST: Hey, Happy Easter Sunday and a Happy Passover.

I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: And I'm Christine Romans. It is Wednesday. It is 31 minutes past the hour. Nice to see you all this morning.</p><p>Let's begin with an image that seemed unimaginable just a few short months ago. North Korean <person><nameText>leader Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>standing side by side with Chinese <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping. </nameText></person>These two leaders shaking hands during Kim's surprise visit to Beijing, his first trip aboard since taking power in 2011. Kim calling for a new era in bilateral relations, even inviting <person><nameText>President Xi </nameText></person>to visit Pyongyang. That is an offer Xi accepted.</p><p>BRIGGS: According to China's state-run media, Kim made the trip because he felt compelled to personally share details of the changing diplomatic landscape on the Korean peninsula. This marks the North Korean leader's emergence as a player on the world stage. Important to note, Xi and Kim are expected to lead their respective countries for life, lending added significance to their talks ahead of an expected summit between Kim and <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>Let's bring in CNN's Ivan Watson who's live with us from Seoul with the latest -- Ivan.</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Dave, this was a surprise summit. We did not hear about the four-day visit of North Korea's leader, his first overseas trip since he assumed the throne in Pyongyang more than six years ago, we didn't hear about it until after he got back to North Korea. That's when China and North Korea both made the announcement that the visit had taken place in the first place.</p><p>And to add to the peculiarities about it, he traveled to and from China aboard a very long train, along with his entourage. A secret train, you could describe it that way. Now China is North Korea's oldest and most important ally, but the relationship has been frosty in recent years, partially due to North Korea's nuclear weapons tests and its frequent ballistic missile launches which are all banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p><p>Well, Xi Jinping, he basically brushed that away, rolled out the red carpet for <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un, </nameText></person>talked about their alliance being a strategic choice, and <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>dangled the prospect of denuclearization, something that he has said has been a taboo in the past, provided South Korea and China cooperate in a move towards peace -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK, Ivan.</p><p>A new CNN poll shows nearly two-thirds of Americans approve of the president's decision to sit down with Kim. But how could the meeting between the two affect the sit down between the U.S. and North Korea?</p><p>WATSON: Well, the White House was very quick to embrace this and say that the meeting is a result of the so-called maximum pressure campaign that Washington has led. That's to impose additional economic sanctions to kind of strangle North Korea economically. And China has been on board with many of those measures.</p><p>Well, now, the North Korean leader can come to an expected face-to- face meeting with <person><nameText>president Trump </nameText></person>saying, hey, I've got China supporting me now, and China has made it clear that its longtime ally, and some argue proxy North Korea, is perhaps back in the fold with Beijing after the two capitals, the two governments were not seeing things eye to eye for quite a long time.</p><p>Xi Jinping, in fact, did say we shouldn't let individual incidents get in the way of this very important bilateral relationship -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Really some stunning images and a major development. Ivan Watson live for us in Seoul, 5:34 p.m. there. Thank you, Ivan.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, really is.</p><p>All right. Thirty-four minutes past the hour.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>securing a trade deal with South Korea, removing a divisive issue with our Korean ally ahead of nuclear talks.</p><p>[04:35:01] The White House confirming details of a revised trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. Many key changes help U.S. car companies. New rules on emissions standards and doubling the number of cars they can export. American car companies can export to South Korea.</p><p>The new deal is for 50,000 American cars per year. But no U.S. carmaker exported more than 11,000 cars last year to South Korea, mainly due to consumer taste. Not trade barriers.</p><p>South Korea, their drivers prefer smaller, fuel-efficient cars. The deal also exempts South Korea from Trump's steel tariffs but limits how much it can export. South Korea's the third-biggest supplier of steel to the U.S. Officials say this delivers on Trump's campaign promise negotiating better trade deals one on one.</p><p>The U.S. is also currently talking with China to avoid a trade war. Trump threatened tariffs on Chinese imports last week, really important here, the timing. China is also the U.S.'s biggest foreign creditor, just as the government plans to sell $294 billion worth of debt this week.</p><p>Look at that. That's the highest amount of debt issued since the financial crisis. China owns more treasury bonds than any foreign country. The sale is to boost federal revenue because of Trump's tax cuts. Companies are paying less into the treasury coffers. That means, government still spending a lot of money, that means the United States has to borrow $300 billion this week to stay in business.</p><p>BRIGGS: It is just hard to believe we are talking annual deficit trickling near a trillion annually under Republican control.</p><p>ROMANS: Deficit hawks are losing their mind.</p><p>BRIGGS: Who would have thunk it?</p><p>Breaking story, moments ago, Stormy Daniels' attorney asking a federal judge for permission to depose <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Michael Avenatti wants the president to share when he knows about the hush money agreement forcing Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged tryst with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Avenatti referring to the $130,000 Daniels received a week and a half before the 2016 election.</p><p>He also requested a deposition for the president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who has said he made the payment out of his own pocket. It comes one day after the White House defended <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>silence on the Stormy Daniels allegations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Why the silence? Is someone advising him to be silent, or is he following --</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I don't think it's silent when the president has addressed this, we've addressed it extensively. There's just nothing else to add. Just because you guys continue to ask the same question over and over and over again doesn't mean that we have to keep coming up with new things to say. We've addressed it. We've addressed it extensively. And there's nothing new to add to this conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Sarah Sanders also saying although the president is a counter puncher, he doesn't necessarily punch back at every story.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>privately floating the idea of using the military budget to build a wall on the border with Mexico. The source telling CNN the president discussed the notion in a private meeting last week with House Speaker Paul Ryan. The topic coming up as they reviewed the federal spending bill which does not include border wall funding.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declining to weigh in at Tuesday's briefing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: The wall is continuing to be built currently, and we're going to keep pushing forward until it's fully completed in the way that the president feels is necessary to defend the country.</p><p>UNIDENFITIED REPORTER: Isn't it true at this point that Mexico's not going to pay for the wall?</p><p>SANDERS: I'm not going to go beyond what the president's already said. I think he still has plans to look at potential ways for that to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: It is not clear how serious the president is about pursuing that idea. It would likely face steep hurdles in Congress. Congress appropriates dollars with very specific instructions on how to spend them. This is the president's latest effort to fund the border wall he promised repeatedly during the campaign that he said Mexico would pay for.</p><p>BRIGGS: Investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller say they have uncovered ties between former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and someone with links to a Russian intelligence service. According to court filings, that person lived in Moscow and Kiev and was in touch with Gates in September and October of 2016.</p><p>ROMANS: The revelation came in court filings ahead of the sentencing of Alex Van Der Zwaan. He's the Dutch lawyer. He worked with Gates and pleaded guilty last month to lying to special counsel about interactions with Gates and that unnamed person.</p><p>BRIGGS: The FBI doubling the staff dealing with huge document demands from Congress in the wake of criticism the bureau is slow walking its response. FBI director Chris Wray putting 54 people in two shifts on the job of reviewing thousands of documents subpoenaed by House Republicans.</p><p>They relate to FBI decisions Republicans have criticized as showing political bias including the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton's private e- mail server, potential FBI abuses of foreign surveillance warrants, and the investigation that led to the firing of former deputy director Andrew McCabe. A Justice Department source tells CNN Attorney General Jeff Sessions has fumed at the pace of the FBI response and it's unacceptable.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. It is official.</p><p>[04:40:00] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress over Facebook's failure to protect user data. Sources tell CNN he felt he had to after facing calls from the media, from the public and lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley wants him at a hearing on April 10th.</p><p>Facebook also has a new legal headache. It's being sued for allegedly allowing housing discrimination. The suit claims its ad tools let marketers exclude single women and families with children.</p><p>Wall Street was not comforted by either of those headlines. Facebook shares fell another 5 percent yesterday. It has lost $80 billion in market value since the crisis began.</p><p>It wasn't just Facebook. The whole tech sector had a terrible day. Twitter, Netflix, Nvidia, Tesla down sharply. Those are big moves for a single, folks.</p><p>Tesla down 8 percent after the government said it would probe last week's fatal self-driving car crash. Tech is the market's most valuable sector. As tech faces regulator scrutiny, investors are growing wary.</p><p>Wall Street closed lower with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down nearly 3 percent. Right now, global stocks and U.S. futures now are down.</p><p>It was really a crazy day. It was up big, then it was down big. It's just -- this is a new era for investors. I think a lot of headline risk.</p><p>BRIGGS: Volatility is the word.</p><p>OK. There's a clown running for Congress in South Carolina. You might be thinking what else is new. But Steve Lough is the real deal. After three decades as a professional clown, think Ringling Brothers, Lough is running in the June primary for the Democratic nomination in South Carolina's fifth congressional district.</p><p>His campaign Website, clownforcongress.com, features him in clown make-up. Sorry, I'm terrified. And videos of him juggling. His slogan, aim high, vote Lough.</p><p>Here's one of three Democrats vying to face Republican incumbent Ralph Norman. Norman won a special election to replace Mick Mulvaney who left the House to become budget director. You do not share my fear of clowns.</p><p>ROMANS: I do not. I do not. I think --</p><p>BRIGGS: The whole killer clown thing was terrifying.</p><p>ROMANS: Didn't you want to grow up and join the circus --</p><p>BRIGGS: I did grow up to be a clown, just no make-up.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Forty-two minutes past the hour.</p><p>A city council hearing taken over by protesters in Sacramento.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As you point this toward council, does this look like a gun?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Anger over the police shooting of an unarmed black man spilling over.</p><p>[04:46:47] ROMANS: Emotions run high at a Sacramento City Council meeting after the police shooting of Stephon Clark. He was shot to death as he stood in his grandmother's backyard. Police claimed they thought the cell phone he was holding was a gun. That was not lost on demonstrators at the council meeting.</p><p>(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does this look as you point this toward council, does this look like a gun?</p><p>CROWD (chanting): Stephon Clark! Stephon Clark! Stephon Clark! Stephon Clark! Stephon Clark! Stephon Clark!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: That young man is Stephon Clark's brother. Sacramento's Mayor Darrell Steinberg forced to gavel the meeting to a close early to guarantee everyone's safety. One person was taken away in handcuffs and charged with assaulting a police officer.</p><p>ROMANS: For the second time in a week, protesters blocked the entrance to the Golden One Center. Kings officials closing the entrances to the NBA arena when protesters showed up outside. That drew an angry online response from ticketholders. But the Kings say they had to shut the doors in the name of safety.</p><p>BRIGGS: In a decision, Alton Sterling's family says it expected no charges will be filed against two police officers who gunned Sterling down in 2016. Louisiana's attorney general says the officers acted lawfully and had reason to believe Sterling was reaching for a gun. Toxicology reports detected alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs in Sterling's system. Sterling's family and supporters say officers should have de-escalated but did not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUINYETTA MCMILLON, MOTHER OF STERLING'S OLDEST SON CAMERON: Yes, the system has failed us. Yes, we are disappointed. As a family, we're going to stay strong and we're going to keep each other prayed up. The devil thought he won, but he didn't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Baton Rouge police say they will release four more videos including body cam, dash cam, and surveillance footage.</p><p>ROMANS: The former boss of disgraced USA gymnastics, Dr. Larry Nassar, is denying charges that include criminal sexual misconduct. The complaint against William Strampel alleges he used his power to sexually assault, harass and solicit nude photos from female students at Michigan State. About 50 photos containing nudity and pornography were found on Strampel's computer in February. Forensics showed someone tried to delete some of the photos.</p><p>Strampel also charged with willful neglect of duty for failing to properly oversee Nassar who admitted to sexually abusing young girls for decades. Strampel could face up to five years in prison.</p><p>BRIGGS: A Kansas grand jury bringing murder charges in the gruesome death of a 10-year-old boy on the world's tallest water slide in 2016. Jeffrey Henry, co-owner of the Schlitterbahn Water Park, and designer John Schooley was charged with reckless second-degree murder along with the company designed in building the 17-story ride.</p><p>Caleb Schwab was decapitated when the raft he and two women were strapped into went airborne.</p><p>The water park issued a statement saying the three men charged are innocent, and that they run a safe operation, adding the facts will prove in court this was just a tragic accident.</p><p>ROMANS: The catastrophic failure at an Ohio fertility clinic far worse than officials first thought. The clinic now says more than four thousand frozen eggs and embryos were lost after a freezer malfunction. That is double the original number, and unlikely any of them are viable now. University Hospital's fertility clinic in Cleveland says 950 families were affected, up from 700.</p><p>The malfunction occurred when temperatures fluctuated in the tanks where eggs and embryos were stored. An investigation revealed an alarm system which should have alerted an employee to temperature swings was shut off. It's a tragedy there.</p><p>ROMANS: Just got harder to find the latest issue of \"Cosmo\" at Walmart. Walmart removing the magazine from checkout lines. We'll tell you why, next.</p><p>[04:55:13] BRIGGS: A march in Paris today to honor the memory of an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor brutally murdered in her apartment. Mireille Knoll was stabbed 11 times before her home was set on fire. Police are investigating her death as a suspected anti-Semitic attack. One two of suspects arrested is Knoll's 27-year-old neighbor who served jail time for sexual assault. The other, a 21-year-old homeless man, known to police for a violent past.</p><p>The threat of severe weather moving up to the South and Gulf Region today.</p><p>Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri joins us from the CNN weather center.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Big-time storms this morning across central portions of Texas. In fact, lightning strikes approaching 1,000 strikes since midnight across the region. And parts of San Antonio, parts of Austin really getting the brunt of the activity, expect all of that to want to shift farther towards the east, quiet right now in places like Houston, Shreveport, and Little Rock. That won't be the case by this afternoon as the line shifts a little farther to the east there. So, we expect a similar sort of a setup across this region with strong thunderstorms, maybe large hail, potentially an isolated tornado could be embedded with some of these storms.</p><p>But the big story is not the rain, hail, even the isolated shot of tornadoes, it's the very, very large likelihood of tremendous rainfall. Some areas getting as much as 10 inches, and, of course, when you put this amount of rainfall anywhere in the world, it's going to cause major problems.</p><p>But this area has already been very saturated in recent weeks. So, that's going to be problematic over the next several days in that region.</p><p>Eighty-two degrees in New Orleans today, 81 in Montgomery, 74 up in Charlotte. While you work your way toward places like Chicago and New York, how about we warm up a little bit in Chicago up to almost 60 degrees -- guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Thanks.</p><p>Let's get a check on CNNMoney this morning.</p><p>Global stocks lower now following a tech sell-off on Wall Street sending U.S. stocks lower. Crazy day. Market was up big, down big. Tech is the market's most valuable sector, but its investors are wary of tech companies face greater regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Facebook fell another 5 percent after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would testify before Congress. For those of you keeping score, it has now shed $80 billion in market value since its data crisis began. It wasn't just Facebook. Twitter, Netflix, Nvidia, Tesla, all plummeted.</p><p>Tesla down 8 percent after the government said it would probe last week's fatal self-driving car crash. Wall Street bankers are making near record bonuses despite cries of overregulation. Last year, the average bonus soared 17 percent to $184,200. Just for some comparison, that's triple the national median household income. And it's just shy of the record in 2006.</p><p>What happened in 2006?

Kirsten Gillibrand's proposed Data Protection Agency would create and enforce new data protection rules. It would encourage the development of new privacy technologies that minimize or eliminate the collection of personal data. The agency would also take action against companies that deploy \"pay-for-privacy\" or \"take-it-or-leave-it\" provisions in their terms of service, according to Gillibrand, a New York Democrat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Gillibrand's bill faces an uphill battle to get passed in the Senate, its proposal for a new privacy agency echoes legislation introduced by two Silicon Valley Democrats late last year.</p><p>Current data privacy rules are inadequate, and a \"lawlessness\" is governing the data privacy space, Gillibrand wrote in a Medium post.</p><p>\"You deserve to be in control of your own data,\" she wrote. \"You have the right to know if companies are using your information for profit. You need a way to protect yourself, and you deserve a place that will look out for you.\"</p><p>Gillibrand's bill has received support from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Public Citizen, the Center for Digital Democracy, and other privacy advocates. </p><p>The FTC declined to comment on Gillibrand's Data Protection Act, but FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has defended his agency's record on privacy. The agency has brought hundreds of privacy cases against tech giants, with \"recent cases generating some of the largest privacy fines in the world,\" Simons wrote in a letter to the editor of the New York Times late last year.</p><p>Simons called for a new federal privacy law and more resources for the FTC. \"But the solution to any privacy vacuum is not an untested new bureaucracy that would enter the game in the fourth quarter,\" he wrote. \"The FTC is already a world-class, award-winning privacy agency, despite its limited authority and resources. Imagine what we could do with more.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, some other privacy advocates applauded Gillibrand's bill, saying an agency zeroed in on consumer privacy could provide new protections.</p><p>The success of a new agency would depend on several factors, including the resources available, said Doris Brogan, a professor at Villanova University's Charles Widger School of Law.</p><p>\"The area is huge and complex and ever-changing,\" she said. \"The problems are often under the radar until they explode, and the nature of the threats are often nuanced and subtle. So, a good idea to create a dedicated agency? Yes, to the extent the agency comes to the table with real independence, adequate resources, and genuine expertise.\"</p><p>However, there is the chance that a specialized agency becomes too close to the companies it attempts to regulate, a long-recognized problem called regulatory capture. \"With the oversized influence of big tech, and the issues of understanding a dense, rapidly evolving, tech-heavy industry, the risk is significant,\" she said.</p><p>Similarly, Rich Spinelli, principal engineer at information technology services firm Core Technologies, called the proposal \"intriguing.\"</p><p>If implemented correctly, a new agency \"has the potential to hit the nail on the head in addressing and punishing abuse and misuse of data privacy caused largely by social media and other tech giants,\" he said. </p><p>However, Congress would need to take care of setting up the new Data Protection Agency, he added. \"It has the potential to become a bloated bureaucracy if it's mission isn't clearly defined or watched over,\" he said.</p><p>Others questioned the value of a new agency. Issues surrounding data privacy and security are \"extremely complex and significantly more nuanced than what appears on first blush,\" said David LaVine, founder of the tech- and engineering-focused RocLogic Marketing. The new agency could potentially create large numbers of new regulations that increase the cost of doing business, he added.</p><p>A new agency would have to limit its focus on reducing \"egregious practices\" at large companies collecting massive amounts of data, LaVine said. \"That means it should only be applicable to a very small fraction of companies and not make every company suffer through regulation that should only be felt by a few,\" he said. \"This agency would also recognize that data privacy is not a black and white topic, but rather one with a lot of gray area that should be dealt with in context, not absolutes.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2359293635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y86-VVF1-JBHT-D37K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Ein wesentliches Ergebnis war, dass aktuelle Systeme die M\u00f6glichkeiten, die die Digitalisierung er\u00f6ffnet, nicht ausnutzen. Ein Gespr\u00e4ch mit Florian Benthin, Senior Manager im Consulting-Bereich bei Deloitte, \u00fcber den aktuellen Status.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">M&amp;K: Haben die Hersteller seit dem Ergebnis der letzten Studie Konsequenzen gezogen und ihre L\u00f6sungen verbessert?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Florian Benthin: Die Resonanz auf die Studie war gro\u00dfartig \u2013 viele Anwender sind auf uns zugekommen und haben unsere Ergebnisse best\u00e4tigt. Wenn man sich allerdings die diesj\u00e4hrigen Portfolio-Updates auf Basis der verf\u00fcgbaren Informationen anschaut, zeigt sich, dass der KIS-Markt recht tr\u00e4ge ist. Und doch hat sich etwas in den letzten ein bis zwei Jahren ge\u00e4ndert. Neue Hersteller mit im Ausland etablierten Produkten betreten den deutschen Markt und erzeugen Ver\u00e4nderungsdruck. Wir vermuten, dass dieser Druck w\u00e4chst und ggf. weitere Marktteilnehmer hinzukommen und die hiesigen Player reagieren m\u00fcssen. Allerdings sind die Potentiale immer noch sehr gro\u00df, egal ob etablierter Hersteller oder neuer Marktteilnehmer. Beispielsweise bietet kaum ein KIS-System die native Integration von Daten von Wearables von Patienten.</p><p>Welche Schritte empfehlen Sie den Herstellern, damit sie die noch immer ungel\u00f6sten Aufgaben realistisch und mit einem m\u00f6glichst rasch sp\u00fcrbaren Patientennutzen angehen k\u00f6nnen?</p><p>Benthin: Zugegeben, eine Ver\u00e4nderung herbeizuf\u00fchren, ist nicht kurzfristig machbar. Dazu sind die Systeme zu komplex und \u201ehistorisch gewachsen\u201c. Insgesamt sind aber drei Aspekte besonders wichtig:</p><p>Erstens sollten Hersteller pr\u00fcfen, ob die jeweiligen Software-Architekturen und Basis-Technologien noch \u201eState-of-the-Art\u201c sind. H\u00e4ufig basieren KIS-Software-Systeme auf alten Programm-Codes, und Module werden immer nur per interne Schnittstellen angebunden. KIS-Hersteller kaufen immer wieder Firmen mit Softwareprodukten f\u00fcr spezifische Aufgaben hinzu und integrieren diese Produkte nicht richtig in die eigene Software-Suite. Die KIS-Software-Suite wirkt dann \u2013 da meist keine einheitliche Struktur \u2013 wie ein Flicken-Teppich mit sehr alten und neuen Flicken.</p><p>Zweitens sollten Hersteller sich st\u00e4rker am Patienten orientieren. Viele heutige KIS-Systeme sind aus der administrativen Perspektive eines Krankenhauses entstanden, d. h., es wurden Software-L\u00f6sungen erschaffen, die die Abrechnung effektiv erledigen und die gesetzlichen Anforderungen erf\u00fcllen. Dabei stand jedoch nie der Patient im Vordergrund. Das muss sich \u00e4ndern. Beim Entwickeln neuer L\u00f6sungen sollte man auch unterst\u00fctzende multidisziplin\u00e4re Methoden wie z. B. Design Thinking oder agile Software-Entwicklung nutzen. Bisher werden diese von vielen Herstellern im Gesundheitswesen noch gar nicht oder nur sehr unzureichend angewandt.</p><p>Schlie\u00dflich sollten sich einige KIS-Hersteller auch von anderen Industrien inspirieren lassen, selbst wenn der deutsche Gesundheitsmarkt komplex und hochgradig reguliert ist. Beispielsweise sind im Bereich der Medizintechnik die Innovationszyklen k\u00fcrzer, obwohl hier die Produkte und deren Produktion technisch hochkomplex sind und Regularien ebenfalls die Freiheiten des Marktes einschr\u00e4nken. Durch einen globalen Wettbewerb werden Produkte immer anwenderorientierter.</p><p>Wie sieht es bei mobilen Anwendungen aus? Inwieweit ist das KIS auf mobilen Endger\u00e4ten herstellerneutral anwendbar? Und wie sch\u00e4tzen Sie die Marktdurchdringung dieser mobilen Variante ein?</p><p>Benthin: Jeder Hersteller m\u00f6chte nat\u00fcrlich seine Software verkaufen und konzentriert sich bei der mobilen App nur auf die eigene Software. Der Anwender hat aber wenig davon, wenn sich die App eines KIS-Herstellers nicht in das RIS/PACS des Krankenhauses einbinden l\u00e4sst, da dieses ggf. nicht vom gleichen Hersteller ist. Letztlich will der Anwender eine einzige App und nicht f\u00fcnf oder zehn verschiedene mit unterschiedlichem Bedienkonzept und Design. Hier ist mehr Integration gefragt und letztlich auch Interoperabilit\u00e4t. Daran hapert es h\u00e4ufig zwischen KIS-Software-Produkten und unterschiedlichen IT-Systemen und auch in der Kommunikation mit Patienten-Daten.</p><p>Zudem haben viele Kliniken nur eine ungen\u00fcgende WLAN-Abdeckung. Gerade in gro\u00dfen Klinik-Komplexen reicht die Verbindung \u00fcber mobiles Internet \u00fcber UMTS/LTE nicht aus. Hier wird der Investitionsstau vieler Krankenh\u00e4user ersichtlich, der immer wieder in verschiedenen Studien, wie dem Krankenhaus-Rating-Report, verdeutlich wird.</p><p>Hat sich denn bei der Integration von Echtzeitdaten etwas bewegt? Vor einem Jahr war ein ganz wesentlicher Kritikpunkt, dass nur zehn Prozent der Befragten der Meinung waren, dass das eingesetzte KIS die optimale \u00f6konomische Steuerung des Krankenhauses gut unterst\u00fctzt.</p><p>Benthin: In der Regel k\u00f6nnen das die KIS-Produkte immer noch nicht. Letztlich sieht die heutige Software-Architektur vieler KIS-Produkte das auch nicht vor, d. h., Business-Warehouse-Module sind h\u00e4ufig separat, weil dazugekauft oder sp\u00e4ter entwickelt, und somit nicht oder schlecht integriert. Hier sind Hersteller mit Produkten auf neuerer Basis besser aufgestellt.</p><p>Patienten erwarten heutzutage digitalisierte Angebote, seien sie personalisiert, in Smartphone Apps oder als Online-Service verf\u00fcgbar. Letztes Jahr hatten aber 60 % der Befragten angegeben, dass sie keine elektronische Unterst\u00fctzung w\u00e4hrend ihrer Zeit im Krankenhaus hatten. Ist hier eine Verbesserung festzustellen? Und falls nicht: Was muss jetzt geschehen, dass sich daran etwas \u00e4ndert?</p><p>Benthin: Wir sprechen mit einigen Kliniken, die eine Digital-Strategie aufbauen. Gerade die Kunden, denen Innovation wichtig ist, m\u00f6chten Dienste wie Apple Health nutzen, wenn sie in Deutschland verf\u00fcgbar sind und Fragen zum Thema Datenschutz und IT-Sicherheit gekl\u00e4rt sind. Immerhin geht es in kleinen Schritten voran. Krankenkassen bauen erstmalig Portale f\u00fcr die Versicherten auf. Auf diesen ersten Schritt m\u00fcssen aber weitere folgen. Es reicht nicht, Informationen nur digital zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen, die Patienten wollen auch sinnvolle und sichere Mehrwertdienste. Das k\u00f6nnte die Anbindung an das Krankenhaus und die elektronische \u00dcbermittlung von Daten sein oder die Analyse ausgew\u00e4hlter Daten mit neuester Forschung. Hier k\u00f6nnten neue Player, wie BIG-TECH-Firmen, zuk\u00fcnftig eine gro\u00dfe Rolle spielen, die bisher nicht im Gesundheitsmarkt bzw. KIS-Markt aufgetreten sind. Deren L\u00f6sungen k\u00f6nnten den Patienten tats\u00e4chlich zum \u201eHerren seiner Daten\u201c machen und damit in den Mittelpunkt stellen.</p><p>Auch die wirtschaftliche Steuerung und das Risikomanagement durch KIS wies laut Ihrer Studie letztes Jahr Schw\u00e4chen auf. Die M\u00f6glichkeiten dazu wurden nur als \u201emittelm\u00e4\u00dfig\u201c betrachtet. Hat sich hier etwas ver\u00e4ndert?</p><p>Benthin: \u00c4hnlich wie bei der Integration der Echtzeitdaten hat sich wenig ver\u00e4ndert. Hier spielt allerdings auch noch ein anderer Punkt eine gro\u00dfe Rolle, denn die Anspr\u00fcche und Anforderungen haben sich ge\u00e4ndert. Fr\u00fcher wurde ein Krankenhaus mit anderen KPIs gesteuert, als es heute notwendig ist. Neben den \u00fcblichen Parametern wie Betten-Auslastung und Case-Mix-Punkte spielen heute Prozesskosten eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Dazu sind zudem komplexe Kostentr\u00e4gerrechnungen notwendig, um patienten- und fallgenau sagen zu k\u00f6nnen, was die einzelnen Elemente einer Behandlung tats\u00e4chlich kosten. Das l\u00e4sst sich zwar alles digital abbilden, aber kaum nativ in einer KIS-Software.</p><p>Welche Trends sehen Sie generell in diesem Markt? Was muss passieren, damit die Digitalisierung im Gesundheitswesen und speziell in den Kliniken nicht l\u00e4nger mit angezogener Handbremse erfolgt?</p><p>Benthin: Vielen Kliniken fehlt es an Finanzierungskraft, und wenn diese doch vorhanden ist, dann werden nur lokale oder ggf. regionale L\u00f6sungen geschafften. Makro\u00f6konomisch gibt es aber mehrere Szenarien, wie die Digitalisierung forciert werden kann. Zum einen sind das regulatorische M\u00f6glichkeiten. Die Bundesregierung sollte sich verst\u00e4rkt Gedanken zu einem eHealth-Gesetz 2.0 machen und gerade im Bereich der F\u00f6rderungen viel st\u00e4rker aktiv sein. Letztlich hat man in den USA am \u201eMeaningful Use Program\u201c gesehen, dass Investitions- und F\u00f6rderprogramme signifikant zur Digitalisierung beitragen k\u00f6nnen. Ein anderes Szenario ist von den Patienten bzw. Kunden getrieben. Wenn digitale Angebote Mehrwerte schaffen und der Business Case stimmt, werden sich solche L\u00f6sungen schnell durchsetzen, die dann ebenfalls die Digitalisierung forcieren.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>Zur Person<br/>Florian Benthin ist seit ca. drei Jahren bei Deloitte t\u00e4tig.

The computer does all the hard work, so the human is just left to do the things that people are really good at. Look out the window, decide where you want to go, and just point the stick to where you want to go, and land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Flyer is an airborne trimaran in gleaming white. The middle pod, where the pilot sits, resembles a Formula 1 car cockpit. It's flanked by a pair of pontoons, so it can land on water as well as earth, with two beams protruding from their sides. With one seat and 10 propellers, it's 13 feet long, 7.5 feet wide, and 5 feet tall. Thanks to carbon fiber construction, the aircraft weighs in at only 250 pounds. Powered by electricity, it is remarkably quiet. It takes off, lands, and flies pretty much like a helicopter.</p><p>Actually, this is the second generation of the Flyer; the first, which Kitty Hawk showed off over San Francisco Bay in June 2017, looked like something a comic book villain might fly, with a seat you straddled. The shift to the protective cockpit, though, pales in importance compared with the transformation in the vehicle's onboard computers. Learning to fly the first version took several days: five hours in a simulator, a day of training, a series of flights while tethered to the ground. The new aircraft lets people with zero aviation experience take off after that 15-minute lesson, thanks to smarter software.</p><p>In a helicopter, the pilot works four controls at once, while monitoring how each impacts the others. In the Flyer, the pilot's left hand works a thumbwheel to go up or down. The right handles a joystick to send the aircraft forward, back, left, right, and around. Let go of the controls and the Flyer holds itself level and in place, like a ship at anchor. That's it. The digital 0s and 1s translate the human pilot's basic commands into aeronautic expertise. The computer sets rotor pitch and speed while using GPS, an inertial measurement unit, lidar laser scanning, and radar to ascertain its position in space. It's as easy as flying a quadcopter drone, except you are inside it.</p><p>Roetter has taken about half a dozen low-speed flights in the Flyer over water. He's more engineer than salesmana software engineer, to be specific. The bullet point on his CV that won him this job was developing an advertising software tool at Twitter that generated billions in revenue. But he's also a licensed pilot, and he lights up while talking about the ride: It's like being a kid.</p><p>The Kitty Hawk model we're looking at is recreational, but what makes it more than a lark for thrill-seekers is that its creators see it as a first step toward something momentousthe flying car. Our long-term vision is to free the world from traffic, Roetter says. The idea is to create a vehicle that can soar over congestion, making short, driving-distance, point-to-point hopsall without fossil fuel emissions. That craft is probably not the Flyer, he continues, the same way that the Wright Flyer was not the vehicle that shrunk the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Orville and Wilbur Wright's airplane, which took off from the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903, was not sold commercially. It was 11 years before the business of passenger aviation got started, and another 25 before Pan Am inaugurated the first transatlantic service. Sometimes you do things in the beginning because they're the first thing, Roetter says. And you learn and grow from there.</p><p>Indeed, while Roetter's team works on the Flyer in the Bay Area, another division of Kitty Hawk is in New Zealand, refining and testing the company's second craft, the Cora. With room for two in its teardrop-shaped cabin, the 12-rotor electric aircraft can take off, fly, and land all by itself.</p><p>Kitty Hawk is far from the only enterprise with ambitions to reshape short-distance travel. Some two dozen companiesfrom mammoths like Boeing and Airbus to Volocopter in Germany and EHang in China, along with a raft of startupsare riding a jet stream of technological advances to create smaller, battery-powered flying vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries have gotten far cheaper and more energy-dense. Distributed propulsion, where a single power source supplies a bunch of small rotors instead of one big one, has enabled designs that are more efficient than helicopters. Boeing and Airbus convinced regulators that lightweight composite materials can withstand the rigors of commercial flight. Consumer drones proved that software could make controlling a complex vehicle as simple as working a joystick.</p><p>As Roetter walks through the warehouse, he points to a cracked pontoon on the airframe that was sacrificed for crash testing and flicks a rotor as he explains that on the Flyer, five propellers spin clockwise, five counterclockwise. At one end of the room a worker with a blowtorch applies a vinyl coating to one Flyer; at the other end, a small crane sits ready to hoist a finished craft into an aboveground pool, to verify that it can land on water without flooding. Other Flyers are waiting to have their battery packs installed in the pontoons or for the flight-control computers to be loaded into the hollow space behind the pilot's seat.</p><p>The Flyers that Kitty Hawk is building now are mostly heading to Nevada's Lake Las Vegas for flight testing, as the company continues to refine that all-important software. Crash testing is done via remote control, but if someone's in the thing, Roetter won't let them fly more than 10 feet up or faster than 20 mph.</p><p>These are early days.</p><p>THE 21ST-CENTURY FLYING-CAR industry took off in October 2016, when Uber announced it was working on an air taxi service called Elevate. The ride-hail giant wouldn't design or build vehicles itself. Instead, it would contract with manufacturers and help coordinate efforts among private and public players to work out regulation, build infrastructure, and develop an air-traffic management system. Once that's all settled and companies start delivering aircraft, Uber would pull them into an urban on-demand aviation service. Five manufacturers, including Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, helicopter maker Bell, and Brazil's EmbraerX, have signed on to produce aircraft. Uber might buy and operate the vehicles itself or work with a company that owns them. The aircraft might fly themselves or have pilots.</p><p>Uber wants to launch a few flying cars for demonstration flights in Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth as soon as next year, with a proper commercial service in both metros by 2023. The idea is to move Uber's ease of use to the sky. You'd pull up an app that would connect you to a vehicle sitting on a helipad. The sweet spot would be routes that might take one or two hours to driveSan Francisco to San Jose, saybut 15 minutes to fly. Morgan Stanley predicts the market for these short-hop electric aircraft could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2040. Airbus wants to produce a productizable demo model next year. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says flying cars will be real in the next five years. Yet for all the technological progress, actually delivering this dream safely to the skies will require a lot more than optimistic talking points.</p><p>ON THE DAY I make the long, traffic-clogged drive from Berkeley to Mountain View to meet Sebastian Thrun, Kitty Hawk's CEO, it's supposed to rain. Thrun meets me in the lobby, says hello, and notices my umbrella. He asks me if it's raining. I tell him no, but that the forecast said it might. Ah, he says with a grin. You are a pessimist.</p><p>Slender, with a shaved head and wearing a suit just because he felt like it today, Thrun looks the part of a 21st-century Captain Nemo. At a time of backlash against Big Tech, he bounces along with untroubled enthusiasm, a blue-eyed riposte to Peter Thiel's 2011 quip mocking Silicon Valley: We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters. By the time the German computer scientist was 36, he had tenure at Stanford University and was running its AI lab. In the mid-2000s he started working at Google, helping to create Street View and running Ground Truth, the massive effort that underpins Google Maps. Thrun launched the company's self-driving car project as well as Google X, its moon-shot factory. So it's no surprise that despite Thrun's lack of aviation experience, his frequent patron, Google's Larry Page, tapped him to run Kitty Hawk. (The company was founded in 2010 by Stanford aerodynamicist Ilan Kroo, who created an early version of what's now the Cora aircraft. Page became the main funder, put Thrun in charge of the effort in 2016, and named it Kitty Hawk.)</p><p>Thrun believes his latest venture can free the world from traffic, but he doesn't overestimate where things stand now. We're still in the infancy, he says, still at the very beginning.</p><p>The first problems Kitty Hawk, Uber, and their ilk must stare down are technical. Take propulsion: Battery tech is getting cheaper and more competitive with gasoline, but it doesn't provide anywhere near the energy density of jet fuel. For every pound of battery, you get 0.1 to 0.15 horsepower-hours. For liquid fuel, it's 7.3 horsepower-hours, a 50-fold advantage. Electric motors are more efficient than combustion engines, but not by enough to close that gap. And the work of building a machine that defies gravity means weight matters more than any other consideration, like the price of materials. In cars, the ranking is cost, volume, weight, says Richard Anderson, director of the Eagle Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In airplanes, it's weight, weight, weight, volume, cost.</p><p>LEARN MORE</p><p>THE WIRED GUIDE TO DRONES</p><p>Reducing noisea necessity for making flying cars ubiquitousexacerbates the problem.

Nur wenn etablierte Versicherer diese Ver\u00e4nderung als Chance begreifen, k\u00f6nnen sie als Gewinner aus diesem Umbruch hervorgehen. Eine bewusste Fokussierung des Gesch\u00e4ftsmodells ist notwendig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mit dem Einstieg von Insurtechs in den Versicherungsmarkt prophezeiten einige bereits das Ende der etablierten Versicherer. Statt Konfrontation setzten sich jedoch \u00fcberwiegend Kooperationen durch. Beim B2C-Onlinemakler Knip, 2015 noch als Star und erkl\u00e4rter Gegner der klassischen Versicherer gefeiert, war nach zwei Jahren die Party schon wieder vorbei.</p><p>Im Gegensatz dazu hat der Onlinemakler Wefox das Potenzial von Kooperationen fr\u00fch erkannt. Seine Plattforml\u00f6sung stellt er auch anderen Maklern zur Verf\u00fcgung. Anfang 2019 konnte das Insurtech eine Finanzierungsrunde mit der Rekordsumme von 110 Mill. Euro abschlie\u00dfen. Weltweit steigen die Investitionen in Insurtechs weiter: Allein von 2017 auf 2018 gab es laut Fintech Global eine Verdoppelung auf weltweit 3,18 Mrd. Dollar.</p><p>Mit Big Techs wie Google, Amazon und Alibaba rollt nun die zweite Welle an neuen Wettbewerbern auf die Versicherungsbranche zu. Sie haben bereits gezielte Schritte in das Versicherungsgewerbe unternommen. MitAmazon Protect bietet der Internet-Riese etwa beim Kauf von elektronischen Artikeln eine Sachversicherung an. Die Regulatorik \u00fcberl\u00e4sst Amazon heute noch dem Kooperationspartner London General Insurance Company. Gemeinsam mitJ.P. Morgan und der Beteiligungsfirma Berkshire Hathaway von Star-Investor Warren Buffett geht Amazon noch einen Schritt weiter. Zusammen wurde die Krankenversicherung Haven gegr\u00fcndet. Diese richtet sich zwar vorerst nur an die eigenen Mitarbeiter, jedoch hat die Nachricht die ganze Branche aufschrecken lassen.</p><p>Wo Insurtechs mit geringem Bekanntheitsgrad, begrenztem Kapital und fehlender Kundenbasis noch zu k\u00e4mpfen hatten, punktet Big Tech gerade dort. Angesichts dieses Wettbewerbs und eines ver\u00e4nderten Marktes m\u00fcssen etablierte Versicherer ihre Rolle neu definieren. H\u00f6here Markttransparenz, einfache Wechselservices, neue innovative Angebote und ein ver\u00e4ndertes Kundenverhalten lassen die Wechselh\u00fcrden br\u00f6ckeln. Stagnation ist keine Option. In einem dynamischen Umfeld in allen Bereichen mit der Entwicklung Schritt zu halten, scheitert regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Oder, um Friedrich den Gro\u00dfen zu bem\u00fchen: \"Wer alles defendieren will, der defendieret gar nichts.\" Eigene Ressourcen m\u00fcssen priorisiert und fokussiert eingesetzt werden.</p><p>In vielen Unternehmen wird der Strategieprozess stiefm\u00fctterlich behandelt. Das funktioniert nur, solange das Umfeld stabil ist und die Organisation lang einstudierte Optimierungsmechanismen selbst\u00e4ndig durchf\u00fchren kann. Grunds\u00e4tzliche Fragen werden selten gekl\u00e4rt.</p><p>Ein ungesch\u00f6nter Blick nach innen sollte ein umfassendes St\u00e4rken-und-Schw\u00e4chen-Profil hervorbringen. Zudem ist eine gemeinsame Hypothese zum Markt der Zukunft eine wichtige Gespr\u00e4chsbasis. M\u00f6gliche Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle k\u00f6nnen in drei Sto\u00dfrichtungen unterschieden werden: Vertrieb, Produktgeber und IT-Provider.</p><p>Schulterschluss z\u00e4hlt</p><p>Der pers\u00f6nliche Vertrieb ist nach wie vor gro\u00dfer Vertrauens- und Verkaufstreiber. Der Trend weist jedoch in Richtung Digitalisierung. Eine erfolgreiche Strategie muss den Schulterschluss schaffen.</p><p>Der pers\u00f6nliche Vertrieb ist mit Abstand der wichtigste Vertriebskanal und sollte auch weiterhin Teil der Zukunftsstrategie sein. Bei der Schaden- und Unfallversicherung war allein der Ausschlie\u00dflichkeitsvertrieb laut Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft 2017 f\u00fcr knapp die H\u00e4lfte aller Abschl\u00fcsse verantwortlich. \u00dcber den Online-Kanal kam rund ein F\u00fcnftel der Neukunden. Bei der Kranken- und Lebensversicherung spielt der Online-Kanal dagegen noch kaum eine Rolle.</p><p>Mit Blick auf die gesamte Customer Journey t\u00e4uscht die scheinbar geringe Relevanz. Vom Erstinteresse bis zum Abschluss wechselt der Kunde regelm\u00e4\u00dfig zwischen den Kan\u00e4len. Zur Informationsbeschaffung ist der Online-Tarifrechner oft fester Bestandteil. Die verschiedenen Kan\u00e4le m\u00fcssen deshalb nahtlos ineinander \u00fcbergehen. Auf ein online berechnetes Angebot sollte etwa das Call-Center bei R\u00fcckfragen des Kunden Zugriff haben. Des Weiteren ist auch der pers\u00f6nliche Vertrieb selbst, etwa \u00fcber Kontaktm\u00f6glichkeiten via Whatsapp oder Video-Chat, ins 21. Jahrhundert zu f\u00fchren.</p><p>Der Direktvertrieb wird sowohl f\u00fcr Anbahnung als auch f\u00fcr den Abschluss immer wichtiger. Erfolg-reiche Direktanbieter haben derzeit bereits erweiterte Kommunikationskan\u00e4le eingef\u00fchrt, etwa Call-Center, Videotelefonie und Chat. Ferner kann auch die Verwendung neuer Technologien das Kundenerlebnis stark vereinfachen. Ein einfaches Foto des Fahrzeugscheins kann ausgelesen und intelligent interpretiert werden und ersetzt so die Eingabe von Daten in den Online-Rechner.</p><p>\u00d6kosysteme werden eine zentrale Rolle im Vertrieb spielen. Um nicht nur White-Label-Produktgeber zu sein, m\u00fcssen Versicherer \u00d6kosysteme selbst aufbauen und orchestrieren. Allerdings muss der Kunde \u00fcber t\u00e4glich relevante Services gebunden werden. Das Versicherungsprodukt an sich eignet sich wenig. Services rund um Pr\u00e4vention bieten sich bei Krankenversicherern an. \u00dcber Life-Style-Apps k\u00f6nnen Kunden in diesem Bereich spielerisch zu einer ges\u00fcnderen Lebensweise motiviert und daf\u00fcr mit einem geldwerten Vorteil belohnt werden.</p><p>Wohin geht die Reise?</p><p>Mit der steigenden Relevanz von \u00d6kosystemen wird auch der Raum f\u00fcr Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle als Produktgeber gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Der Versicherer schafft sich dadurch Zugang zu neuen Kunden. Allein Amazon hat laut Statista rund 44 Millionen regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Kunden in Deutschland. Um sich auf diesem Markt durchsetzen zu k\u00f6nnen, ist eine Spezialisierung auf die klassischen Kernbereiche wie Risikomanagement, Schadenabwicklung und Produktentwicklung eine zentrale Voraussetzung. Besonders wichtig sind sowohl die einfache und nahtlose Integration des Produktes in die fremde Vertriebsoberfl\u00e4che als auch ein hoher Automatisierungsgrad. Wo hier die Reise hingeht, zeigt der chinesische Versicherer Ping An. Bei der Schadenabwicklung von Autounf\u00e4llen wird mithilfe von Bilderkennung und k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI) der Schaden laut eigenen Angaben mit einer Genauigkeit von 95,5 % erfasst.</p><p>Gro\u00dfer Digitalisierungsbedarf</p><p>Der Bedarf an Digitalisierung und neuen Technologien bei den etablierten Versicherern ist gro\u00df, um an der Kundenschnittstelle oder als Produktgeber Schritt zu halten. Bei der Entwicklung st\u00f6\u00dft die eigene Organisation schnell an ihre Grenzen. Statt L\u00f6sungen selbst zu entwickeln, ist es oft ratsamer, diese von Dritten einzukaufen. Viele Insurtechs erkennen dieses Potenzial und stellen etablierten Branchenvertretern White-Label-L\u00f6sungen zur Verf\u00fcgung, bei denen technische Innovationen eines Start-ups in die eigenen Systeme unter eigener Marke integriert werden.</p><p>Gleiches gilt f\u00fcr etablierte Versicherer, die dem Markt eigene L\u00f6sungen bereitstellen k\u00f6nnen. Oft wird das eigene Know-how in dieser Beziehung untersch\u00e4tzt. Die Bearbeitung von Schadenprozessen k\u00f6nnte beispielsweise auch f\u00fcr andere Versicherer oder Insurtechs relevant sein. Zum einen w\u00e4re es eine neue Ertragsquelle, und zum anderen w\u00fcrde es leichter fallen, gr\u00f6\u00dfere Investitionen in die Automatisierung zu rechtfertigen.</p><p>Mit den neuen Wettbewerbern wird eine breite Vielfalt digitaler Neuerungen in den Markt gesp\u00fclt. Um erfolgreich zu bestehen, reichen keine Ma\u00dfnahmen im \"Klein-Klein\". Eine Grundsatzdiskussion zur Ausrichtung des Gesch\u00e4ftsmodells muss stattfinden. Sind die Kernkompetenzen und die Sto\u00dfrichtung klar, f\u00e4llt es leichter, die eigenen Ressourcen zu priorisieren. Verbleibende L\u00fccken sollten \u00fcber Partnerschaften geschlossen werden.</p><p>-----</p><p>Robert Meitz, Senior Manager bei Berg Lund &amp; Company</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2019126030\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2019126030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHR-PXK1-DY1C-732V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) introduced legislation Tuesday that would require dominant companies to prove their exclusionary conduct doesn't harm competition. Klobuchar, ranking member of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, announced the legislation during a subcommittee hearing (see 2003090037). Yelp Senior Vice President-Public Policy Luther Lowe said he knows dozens and dozens of CEOs who don't speak publicly about Google's anticompetitive behavior due to fear of retaliation.</p><p>Congress should act to protect companies from \"retribution or retaliation, which is a violation of law,\" Blumenthal told us. \"We have to treat them as whistleblowers, give them anonymity if necessary and other kinds of protections.\" Google didn't comment.</p><p>The Anticompetitive Exclusionary Conduct Prevention Act would shift the burden of proof. That's \"so that powerful companies that have a market share of greater than 50% or that otherwise have substantial market power would have to prove that their exclusionary conduct in the markets they dominate does not present an 'appreciable risk of harming competition,'\" said an announcement.</p><p>Companies should be born free, not born into captivity, said Chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, during the hearing. He questioned Yelp's claims that Google's self-preferencing leads to degraded Search results for consumers. He suggested Amazon selling products that compete with rivals on its platform helps cut prices.</p><p>Courts have rendered antitrust enforcement \"toothless\" regarding self-preferencing, Klobuchar said. Her bill amends the Clayton Antitrust Act to \"prohibit 'exclusionary conduct' that presents an 'appreciable risk of harming competition.'\" The legislation would clarify antitrust laws don't \"require definition of a relevant market, unless the statutory language explicitly requires it to resolve the case.\" It would limit courts' ability to \"imply antitrust immunity for regulated conduct.\"</p><p>If Google is self-preferencing, it risks losing users to competitors like Bing and DuckDuckGo, said Clemson University economist Thomas Hazlett. Google rose to dominance because it offered products consumers desire, he said. He argued that antitrust enforcement against Microsoft in the late 1990s didn't achieve the competition it envisioned because Netscape didn't end up competing. Microsoft continued to dominate the browser market for 10 years, Hazlett said. Google integrated with Gmail, Chrome and other products, allowing it to compete, he said. The same could be said about Apple with Safari. New platforms are capable of uprooting incumbents, he said.</p><p>As long as platforms are competing to outdo one another, things are working for the consumer, said ACT|The App Association President Morgan Reed. Consumers can't afford to have platforms engaging in harmful and deceptive self-preferencing, he said.</p><p>Antitrust cases need to be simpler, cheaper and faster so enforcers can bring more cases, said Open Markets Institute Enforcement Strategy Director Sally Hubbard. She called Klobuchar's bill a step in the right direction because bringing more cases will help correct antitrust law. She said the federal government shouldn't pre-empt stronger state privacy laws. Reed disagreed, arguing a patchwork of state laws is one of the most important anticompetitive issues. Small businesses don't have resources to handle that compliance burden, he said.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Blumenthal wrote DOJ Tuesday, asking Attorney General William Barr to include Google Search, not just advertising tech, in the department's antitrust review of the company. Google is manipulating Search results to privilege its own services, Hawley alleged. There's an overarching feeling the antitrust framework isn't working when applied to big tech, said Blumenthal. Google didn't comment.</p><p>Blumenthal is glad Lowe mentioned the fear of retaliation. Enforcement is hampered by market power but also the threat of retaliation, which is somewhat invisible, Blumenthal said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDS-XYN1-JC8G-80M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), two of the most outspoken Democrats on antitrust issues, are set to headline a fundraiser benefiting Joe Biden \u2019s campaign billed as a \u201cVirtual Conversation on the Future of Antitrust,\u201d according to an invitation obtained by PI. The fundraiser was originally scheduled to be held this evening with only Klobuchar headlining it, but the event appears to have been moved to Aug. 24 with Cicilline added to the bill. A list of upcoming fundraisers sent out on Monday describes the event as \u201ca chance to talk about technology and antitrust with Sen. Klobuchar.\u201d   \u2014 The event is notable because Klobuchar is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee and Cicilline is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee. Neither of them has made a secret of their views on antitrust. Klobuchar has urged scrutiny of proposed mergers this year involving Google , Uber and Facebook . And Cicilline summoned Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg , Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai , Apple \u2019s Tim Cook and Amazon \u2019s Jeff Bezos to testify before his subcommittee last month in a widely watched hearing.   \u2014 When the antitrust \u201claws were written, the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie,\u201d Cicilline said in his closing remarks in the hearing . \u201cTheir control of the marketplace allowed them to do whatever it took to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. Well, the names have changed, but the story is the same. Today, the men are named Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai and Bezos.\u201d   \u2014 The fundraiser benefits the Biden Victory Fund and appears to have been organized by Lawyers for Biden, which Biden\u2019s campaign website describes as \u201ca select group of lawyers, including general counsels of leading organizations, senior partners at law firms, and other prominent attorneys.\u201d The original invitation described the event as a \u201cVirtual Conversation on the Future of Antitrust,\u201d but the updated one with Cicilline\u2019s name added promises only a \u201cVirtual Conversation.\u201d Tickets range from $10,000 to attend as a \u201cchair\u201d \u2014 which includes access to a \u201cpre-reception\u201d to $250 for those content to attend as \u201csupporters.\u201d Neither Biden\u2019s campaign nor Klobuchar responded to requests for comment.   Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips: [email protected] . Twitter: @theodoricmeyer .     A message from Facebook:     It\u2019s time for updated internet regulations to prevent election interference. We\u2019ve more than tripled our security and safety teams to 35,000 people, added 5-step political ad verification and partnered with security researchers, other tech companies and law enforcement to combat foreign election interference. What\u2019s next? We support updated internet regulations.      CONSIDER THE DONORS: People affiliated with JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Citigroup , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have given more than three times as much money to Joe Biden \u2019s campaign as they have to President Donald Trump \u2019s, POLITICO \u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt report. Those writing checks include Stephen Scherr , Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief financial officer; Stacey Friedman , JPMorgan\u2019s general counsel; Kathy Matsui , Goldman Sachs\u2019 vice chair in Japan; Thomas Nides , Morgan Stanley\u2019s vice chair; and Bill Daley , Wells Fargo\u2019s vice chair of public affairs. Daley is a former chief of staff to President Barack Obama , of course, while Nides is a former deputy secretary in Obama\u2019s State Department.   NEW CAMPAIGN WILL TAKE ON DELIVERY APPS: \"A group known for taking on Big Tech is biting into its next target: food delivery apps like Grubhub , UberEats , Postmates and DoorDash ,\" Axios ' Ashley Gold reports. \"The Economic Liberties Project , in a new campaign it calls 'Protect our Restaurants' launching Tuesday, is encouraging restaurants to lobby for local laws that cap the commissions these apps can collect.\" The group \"is providing restaurants with an organizing guide with tips on contacting local legislators and encouraging them to sign a letter to the Federal Trade Commission urging the agency to investigate\" the companies.   INSIDE A FORMER LOBBYIST\u2019S SENATE CAMPAIGN: Lisa Rab has a piece in POLITICO Magazine on Jaime Harrison \u2019s campaign to unseat Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), which includes a bit about Harrison\u2019s time as a lobbyist at the Podesta Group , the once-prominent Washington lobbying firm that collapsed in 2017. Harrison lobbied for clients including Boeing , Walmart , Wells Fargo , the American Chemistry  Council and the National Association of Broadcasters , according to disclosure filings. \u201cWhile lobbying for Michelin North America , which is based in South Carolina, he met the company\u2019s former CEO Dick Wilkerson , who has become one his most vocal donors and supporters.\u201d     Jobs Report    \u2014 Bully Pulpit Interactive has promoted Ivanka Farrell to senior director for media operations, Jesse Thomas to senior director for impact and mobilization and Sarah Zukowski and Hilary Nachem Lowenstein both to senior director.   \u2014 The law firm Harmon Curran has hired Brett Kappel as a counsel and Susan Hamsher as a senior associate.

Kyung, thank you.</p><p>After two deadly crashes and an investigation that will stretch into the new year, the head of Boeing is out. Details just ahead.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>DEAN: It has been a tumultuous year for Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. And it is ending on a low note. The embattled executive has just been forced out by the company's board of directors. His firing coming in the aftermath of the investigation into two deadly plane crashes involving the controversial 737 MAX jets. Boeing has since been plagued by multiple issues surrounding the fleet of jets, and production has now been suspended indefinitely.</p><p>CNN's Richard Quest joins me now, and Richard, Boeing said it was time for a change in leadership, but that it was also very, quote, necessary. What else do you know?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN MONEY EDITOR AT LARGE: Yes, I mean, they said it was time to rebuild trust with everybody. And by that, principally, it's trust with their regulator. Because the last few weeks have seen Boeing and the regulator once again -- the FAA that is -- once again at loggerheads.</p><p>The FAA feeling that Boeing has tried to pressurize it, to get back the 737 back into the air, and that believed to be the reason that the board decided at a weekend meeting not only to cancel or at least stop production of the 737 MAX from January, but also that Muilenburg had to go.</p><p>It's not of course the first -- he's not the first to go, Kevin McAllister the head of commercial went earlier in the year. He didn't get the chairman's job, there'll be a new chairman, there'll be a new CEO. And essentially Muilenburg was always going to have to leave, it was only a question of when.</p><p>DEAN: Of when and how. Right. And do we know -- what do we know about the replacement -- his replacement?</p><p>QUEST: His replacement, David Calhoun, he is the current Chairman of Boeing. And he has been on the board of Boeing since 2009. Now, he was brought to the chairmanship after it was taken away from Muilenburg, and you get an idea. I mean is he a clean pair of hands? To some extent, yes. But at the same time, he was certainly around Boeing through much of the transgressions.</p><p>And the other person being brought in as the new Chairman is a guy called -- former CEO of Continental Airlines, Larry Kellner. He's the new Chairman, Dave Calhoun is the new CEO and Muilenburg is out.</p><p>DEAN: And then what will happen with the MAX jets? Do they think that production is going to resume for those?</p><p>QUEST: Well, production won't resume until the plane is no longer grounded. And the FAA in their statement today acknowledging that the CEO is gone, they have basically said, it will only go back into the air, when we are sure it's safe. And they've called on Boeing for more transparency in the data transmission and also in terms of the training. Look, we don't know when the 737 will go back in the air, but it's a fair guess it's not going to be any time soon.</p><p>And finally, even when they do unground the planes, there are nearly 800 that have to be checked to make sure they're air worthy to fly again.</p><p>DEAN: Quite a job, all right, Richard Quest, thanks so much.</p><p>As 2019 draws to a close, we're taking a look back at the biggest media stories of the year, from Jeff Bezos' showdown with the \"National Enquirer\" to the Trump administration's daily war with facts. We're going to count down the biggest media stories of 2019 when we come back.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>DEAN: With 2020 now just days away, believe it or not, we're almost there. We're counting down the biggest media stories for this year. Quality investigative journalism certainly triumphed in a big way in the past 12 months. The epic battle began for online streaming supremacy, and then there's Fox News and its cozy relationship with the White House. CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter looks back at 2019.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: A misinformation minefield feeding a war on truth. Plus an abrupt departure, shocking investigations and an alleged corporate cover-up. Here are the top 9 media stories of 2019.</p><p>Number 9, Jeff Bezos versus the \"National Enquirer.\" In January the tabloid published a bombshell about the Amazon founder's love life. A month later the tech billionaire who also owns \"The Washington Post\" went public with a stunning allegation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Breaking now, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, accusing the \"National Enquirer\" of blackmail and extortion.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>STELTER: AMI, the parent company of the \"Enquirer\" denied trying to extort Bezos with racy pictures and texts. But federal prosecutors began looking into the claim. Later AMI's hedge fund owner announced a sale of the tabloid after reportedly being disgusted with the \"Enquirer's\" tactics.</p><p>So will the company pay a legal price for tangling with Jeff Bezos? Well, that is still an open question.</p><p>Number 8, the fall of local news. While many big papers are gaining digital subscribers, local papers are struggling. And some are even going out of print. Across the country, newsrooms are being hollowed out, leaving behind ghost papers that are shells of their former selves.</p><p>America's biggest newspaper chains, GateHouse and Gannett just merged and now they're making more cuts. If there's a silver lining it's that more people are subscribing to digital outlets, but local papers are critically important. It's where some of the best watchdog reporting comes from.</p><p>Which brings us to number 7 -- a triumph of investigative journalism. The Jeffrey Epstein scandal was forced on to the national news radar thanks to one newspaper, \"The Miami Herald.\" Intrepid reporting from the paper's Julie K. Brown effectively caused the case to be reopened.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will say that we were assisted from some excellent investigative journalism.</p><p>STELTER: And the \"Herald's\" reporting didn't just lead to Epstein's arrest, it also forced the exit of a Trump cabinet member.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigning after the fallout from the sweetheart deal, he gave to Jeffrey Epstein as a prosecutor a decade ago.</p><p>STELTER: It's why local journalism is so crucial. It holds the powerful to account.</p><p>Number 6 is #me-too, two years later. Women journalists are keeping the pressure on powerful men, Gayle King kept her composure as R. Kelly ranting. The BBC's Emily Maitlis was widely praised for her interview of Prince Andrew.</p><p>And more just keeps coming out. Ronan Farrow's \"Catch and Kill\" contained an explosive rape allegation against former \"Today Show\" host Matt Lauer. An accusation Lauer categorically denied. Farrow also pointed a finger at NBC alleging a corporate coverup. NBC dismissed his book as distorted and inaccurate.</p><p>Number 5 -- in Hollywood, the streaming wars are on. Apple TV Plus launched in November, with programming from A list talent. Disney Plus followed two weeks later, and 10 million subscribers signed up in the first day crashing the platform early on.</p><p>CNN's parent company, Warner Media, unveiled its plans for HBO Max, and all these companies are chasing Netflix which doubled -- no, tripled down on original content. It funded Martin Scorcese's \"The Irishman\" mostly bypassing a traditional theatrical release. Number 4, it is Fox versus Fox, with news being squeezed out and pro- Trump opinion winning the day. At Fox News the tension's built all year long.</p><p>SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: Attacking our colleague who's here to offer legal assessments on our air in our work home is repugnant.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Repugnant. Not clear if that was you or me, but someone's repugnant.</p><p>STELTER: And adding to the pressure, President Trump lashed out whenever Democrats or dissenters appeared on Fox.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's something going on at Fox I'll tell you that right now and I'm not happy with it.</p><p>STELTER: The ultimate flashpoint came in October when chief news anchor Shephard Smith resigned.</p><p>SMITH: Even in our currently polarized nation it's my hope that the facts will win the day. That the truth will always matter.</p><p>STELTER: Smith provided a reality check to Fox's viewers who pretty much hear pro-Trump talking points all day long. And now reporters at Fox are worried that Shep's exit has left a giant hole.</p><p>And that feeds into number 3 -- impeachment's dueling media bunkers. The networks went wall to wall for the hearings. On day one, two career diplomats testified for six hours. But in Fox's alternative universe viewers heard that the hearing was a disaster and downright boring.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So day one of this impeachment farce.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was such a disaster.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A triple full disaster for the Democrats.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Complete and utter disaster.</p><p>STELTER: All across the pro-Trump media universe, far right websites hyped clips of GOP stars like Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes, experts said that this echo chamber really helped protect Trump and exacerbated the country's divisions.</p><p>And all of this gets amplified on the web, which brings us to number 2. The misinformation age with deep fakes and dumb fakes, bots and trolls, making it harder and harder to know what is true. Like a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowed down to make it look like she was slurring her words. It racked up millions of views on Facebook which refused to take it down.</p><p>[15:50:02]</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Why keep it up then?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We didn't. Yes. We think it's important for people to make their own informed choice about what to believe.</p><p>STELTER: And it is only getting worse heading into 2020. Facebook is sparking outrage for essentially allowing lies in political ads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact checking on political advertisements?</p><p>STELTER: Facebook claims that its job is not to decide whether an ad is true or false. Although the company is said to be considering some changes. Google already made a few tweaks limiting how political ads are micro targeted to people, and Twitter has stopped taking political ads entirely. But the big tech backlash is growing.</p><p>The constant haze of misinformation brings us to number 1. The war on truth and the Trump administration's daily assault on facts.</p><p>TRUMP: The deep state and the failed ruling class --</p><p>The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us.</p><p>The opponents, the opposition, the Democrats, the radical left, deep state, whatever you want to call them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: More gaslighting. There is no deep state conspiracy. Nope.</p><p>STELTER: Trump's message is don't believe your eyes, don't believe your ears, only believe me. And it has undermined the trust in everything. Remember Sharpie gate? As Hurricane Dorian approached Trump said Alabama was at risk when it wasn't even after weather officials tweeted a correction, the President persisted, holding up an altered map. Agency staffers reportedly felt pressure to support his lies.</p><p>COOPER: To say this out loud it sounds ludicrous but as you pointed out we have federal employees getting reprimanded for accurately disclosing scientific truth.</p><p>STELTER: That is a war on truth and we see it again now with the assertion that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: There's one reason they're changing this story for you right now and it's to confuse you and distract you and make you not care about it because it doesn't seem to make sense anymore because nothing's true.</p><p>STELTER: Does anyone know what to believe any more, and what does it mean for our democracy if we can no longer agree on objective truth. That is the challenge heading into 2020.</p><p>Brian Stelter, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEAN: Brian, thank you. Millions are traveling for the holidays and many people are running into severe weather as they go, we're going to tell you what you could expect next.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>DEAN: Fires, floods, and massive traffic accidents have already marred the holiday travel rush. Take a look at this 69-car pile-up on an icy Virginia bridge, that happened Sunday. Dozens of people were injured in that. In south Florida, flash flooding from heavy rains brought the runways at Fort Lauderdale to a standstill. It was so bad their planes were not able to take off.</p><p>And then there was some travel mayhem on both ends of California, some empty airport passenger buses caught fire at Los Angeles International. And there were long lines at departure terminal in Sacramento where the internet went down. It's going great out there.</p><p>CNN affiliate KCRA reports a car crash damaged fiber-optic cables, so what are the trouble spots right now? For that we bring meteorologist Tom Sater and the CNN Weather Center for some answers. Tom, how's it looking?</p><p>TOM SATER, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Jessica, not so bad really. Over the river, through the woods. Most of the U.S. will have temperatures more like Easter than they will Christmas. If you're hoping for a white Christmas, if the snow is not already on the ground, most of us are not going to see it at all.</p><p>West of the front range of the Rockies, that's where winter weather is going to grip and really cause some travel problems. And right here in the east we had what we call a southeast soaker, a raw, ugly cold rainy day yesterday trying to find that last-minute gift, just can you imagine battling wind-driven cold rain looking for the last parking spot.</p><p>This is going to be moving out overnight tonight but it's already been dropping a good two to five inches. Six and seven, eight-inch local amounts in some areas. We had 10 million under flash flood watches now it's kind of whittled down to about 4 million. But this is going to be moving out. Heaviest rain with the flooding, coastal South Carolina and Georgia.</p><p>So the good news is this moves out and in the wake this nothing but sunshine. The temperature forecast is really -- it's not going to put you in the holiday spirit so you're going to have to build your own spirit here. Look at these numbers, not just 10 to 15 degrees warmer than they should be but even 20 and 25 degrees warmer.</p><p>Chicago's normal high 33 degrees, they're at 55 Wednesday, 56 Thursday. St. Louis is in the mid-60s. And so really from the central Rockies eastward no great chance of snow. Temperatures well warmer than they should be. That goes all the way to the Canadian border.</p><p>Out West, however, it is a different story and that is where we got a lot of rainfall. Southern California, mountain snows, several states looking at winter weather advisories. Could have some flight delays in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, LA already seeing hour long delays in San Francisco. So the mountain snows and the valley rainfall is going to hang around and that is where you're going to have your white Christmas. But overall if you're looking form smooth sailing to get to grandma's house, things look good for most of the country -- Jessica.</p><p>DEAN: All right, Tom Sater, thanks so much.</p><p>And for all of you out there we wish safe travels and a lot of fun with those you love. Thanks so much for watching today. Erica Hill fills in for Jake Tapper on \"THE LEAD.\" It starts right now.</p><p>[16:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019122308CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTJ-3ST1-JB20-G504-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 23, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online\u2014making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever\u2014families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security.</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers\u2019 data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights.</p><p>\u201cCompanies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cOur legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It\u2019s time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cThey should be like your Miranda rights\u2014clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.</p><p>\u201cWhen consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won\u2019t be used to harm them,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cOur bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demand for consumers\u2019 personal information today is at an all-time high,\u201d Markey said. \u201cBut while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\u201d</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE. A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE. The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE.</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is supported by consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts:</p><p>\u201cThis is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors\u2019 leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans,\u201d said Former FTC Commissioner Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports.</p><p>\u201cThis bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information \u2014whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right \u2014a measure long overdue \u2014but it also recognizes that \u2018rights\u2019 that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data,\u201d said Former FTC Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection David Vladeck, Georgetown University Law Center Professor.</p><p>\u201cAfrican Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation,\u201d said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League.</p><p>\u201cIn today\u2019s online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals\u2019 personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias,\u201d said the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.</p><p>\u201cThe Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S ,\u201d said Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald.</p><p>Klobuchar has been leading the fight to protect consumers\u2019 online privacy. In January, Klobuchar and Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act, bipartisan legislation that would protect the privacy of consumers\u2019 online data by improving transparency, strengthening consumers\u2019 recourse options when a breach of data occurs, and ensuring companies are compliant with privacy policies that protect consumers.</p><p>Klobuchar and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are the authors of the Protecting Personal Health Data Act, bipartisan legislation to protect consumers\u2019 private health data not covered under existing privacy law. While recent reports have highlighted how home DNA testing kits and health data tracking apps have given companies access to unprecedented levels of consumer health data, current law does not adequately address the emerging privacy concerns presented by these new technologies. The Protecting Personal Health Data Act addresses these health privacy concerns by requiring the Secretary of HHS to promulgate regulations for new health technologies such as health apps, wearable devices like Fitbits, and direct-to-consumer genetic testing kits that are not regulated by existing laws. Last week, the senators urged the Department of Health and Human Services to examine a collaboration between Google and Ascension health system that enables Google to collect the personal health information of roughly 50 million Americans\u2014including personally identifiable information, lab results, hospital records, and physician diagnoses\u2014without their knowledge or consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2655109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-SWG1-JDG9-Y4VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- New consumer rights guaranteed by strong federal compliance and consumer right to sue</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) joined Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Ed Markey (D-MA) in unveiling comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online. With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online--making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever--families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" Klobuchar said. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" Schatz said. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE. A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE. The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE.</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is supported by consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts:</p><p>\"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans,\" said Former FTC Commissioner Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports.</p><p>\"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data,\" said Former FTC Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection David Vladeck, Georgetown University Law Center Professor.</p><p>\"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation,\" said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League.</p><p>\"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias,\" said the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.</p><p>\"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.,\" said Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald.</p><p>Klobuchar has been leading the fight to protect consumers' online privacy. In January, Klobuchar and Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act, bipartisan legislation that would protect the privacy of consumers' online data by improving transparency, strengthening consumers' recourse options when a breach of data occurs, and ensuring companies are compliant with privacy policies that protect consumers.</p><p>Klobuchar and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are the authors of the Protecting Personal Health Data Act, bipartisan legislation to protect consumers' private health data not covered under existing privacy law. While recent reports have highlighted how home DNA testing kits and health data tracking apps have given companies access to unprecedented levels of consumer health data, current law does not adequately address the emerging privacy concerns presented by these new technologies. The Protecting Personal Health Data Act addresses these health privacy concerns by requiring the Secretary of HHS to promulgate regulations for new health technologies such as health apps, wearable devices like Fitbits, and direct-to-consumer genetic testing kits that are not regulated by existing laws. Last week, the senators urged the Department of Health and Human Services to examine a collaboration between Google and Ascension health system that enables Google to collect the personal health information of roughly 50 million Americans--including personally identifiable information, lab results, hospital records, and physician diagnoses--without their knowledge or consent.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6941081 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6941081</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-CPD1-JC11-11H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1454\"/><timeReceived>7:55 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Amy Klobuchar:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New consumer rights guaranteed by strong federal compliance and consumer right to sue WASHINGTON Today, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) joined Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Ed Markey (D-MA) in unveiling comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online. With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done onlinemaking this the largest online holiday shopping season everfamilies everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights. \"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. </p><p>Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" Klobuchar said. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\" \"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation. \"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" Schatz said. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\" \"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\" The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE. A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE. The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is supported by consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans,\" said Former FTC Commissioner Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports. \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right a measure long overdue but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data,\" said Former FTC Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection David Vladeck, Georgetown University Law Center Professor. \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation,\" said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League. \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias,\" said the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.,\" said Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald . Klobuchar has been leading the fight to protect consumers' online privacy. In January, Klobuchar and Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act, bipartisan legislation that would protect the privacy of consumers' online data by improving transparency, strengthening consumers' recourse options when a breach of data occurs, and ensuring companies are compliant with privacy policies that protect consumers. Klobuchar and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are the authors of the Protecting Personal Health Data Act, bipartisan legislation to protect consumers' private health data not covered under existing privacy law. While recent reports have highlighted how home DNA testing kits and health data tracking apps have given companies access to unprecedented levels of consumer health data, current law does not adequately address the emerging privacy concerns presented by these new technologies. The Protecting Personal Health Data Act addresses these health privacy concerns by requiring the Secretary of HHS to promulgate regulations for new health technologies such as health apps, wearable devices like Fitbits, and direct-to-consumer genetic testing kits that are not regulated by existing laws. Last week, the senators urged the Department of Health and Human Services to examine a collaboration between Google and Ascension health system that enables Google to collect the personal health information of roughly 50 million Americansincluding personally identifiable information, lab results, hospital records, and physician diagnoseswithout their knowledge or consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123346157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM3-61H1-JCBF-S1Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Klobuchar, Amy - (D - MN) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) joined Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Ed Markey (D-MA) in unveiling comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online. With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online--making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever--families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" Klobuchar said. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" Schatz said. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>.

We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans,\" said Former FTC Commissioner Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports.</p><p>\"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data,\" said Former FTC Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection David Vladeck, Georgetown University Law Center Professor.</p><p>\"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation,\" said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League.</p><p>\"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias,\" said the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.</p><p>\"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.,\" said Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald.</p><p>Klobuchar has been leading the fight to protect consumers' online privacy. In January, Klobuchar and Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act, bipartisan legislation that would protect the privacy of consumers' online data by improving transparency, strengthening consumers' recourse options when a breach of data occurs, and ensuring companies are compliant with privacy policies that protect consumers.</p><p>Klobuchar and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are the authors of the Protecting Personal Health Data Act, bipartisan legislation to protect consumers' private health data not covered under existing privacy law. While recent reports have highlighted how home DNA testing kits and health data tracking apps have given companies access to unprecedented levels of consumer health data, current law does not adequately address the emerging privacy concerns presented by these new technologies. The Protecting Personal Health Data Act addresses these health privacy concerns by requiring the Secretary of HHS to promulgate regulations for new health technologies such as health apps, wearable devices like Fitbits, and direct-to-consumer genetic testing kits that are not regulated by existing laws. Last week, the senators urged the Department of Health and Human Services to examine a collaboration between Google and Ascension health system that enables Google to collect the personal health information of roughly 50 million Americans--including personally identifiable information, lab results, hospital records, and physician diagnoses--without their knowledge or consent.</p><p>Read this

Knight Foundation issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation has announced more than $3.5 million in funding to support new, independent research into issues at the forefront of national tech policy debates. Twenty-two universities, think tanks and advocacy organizations will study diverse, timely topics including content moderation by social media companies, antitrust enforcement in big tech and the pervasive problem of disinformation online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research, intended for near-term application, will help meet the urgent needs of federal lawmakers and other decision-makers as they shape the future of the internet, as the impact of technology on our society and democracy becomes ever more significant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"These issues are moving faster than we can evaluate and analyze them. We need to close the knowledge gap, if our society is going to make smart decisions about how to ensure technology strengthens democracy rather than weakening it,\" said Sam Gill, vice president at Knight Foundation. \"Knight is investing in and supporting this research to ensure that a diverse range of views and a body of real evidence informs urgent policy debates. How we answer the questions of today will shape the American democracy of tomorrow.\"</p><p>The institutions receiving new Knight support were selected through an open funding opportunity to expand fundamental research on the norms, rights and responsibilities that govern digital services, in particular, social media. The funding opportunity is ongoing.</p><p>Research topics include the responsibilities of social media companies and digital service providers with regard to how they moderate, police and present content that increasingly informs our national civic conversation, and issues of antitrust and competition in the online arena. Both reflect ongoing debates on Capitol Hill and critical conversations in Silicon Valley.</p><p>In recent months, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have held hearings on questions of market power, antitrust, technology companies' use of algorithms and their accountability in enabling online extremism and violence. This has prompted policymakers to consider whether, and to what extent, to change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from legal liability over content posted by their users.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have separate ongoing investigations into the competition and business practices of several tech companies. Additionally, almost all state attorneys general are investigating both Google and Facebook for anti-competitive behavior. And, last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced intense scrutiny by members of the House Financial Services Committee regarding the company's cryptocurrency plans and its role in society at large.</p><p>The investments are part of Knight's recently announced $50 million commitment to support research on how technology is transforming our democracy and the way in which people are informed in the digital age. The foundation committed nearly $45 million earlier this year to support long-term research at American universities, research institutions and think tanks.</p><p>The full list of Knight's new research investments includes:</p><p>American Antitrust Institute ($100,000): To support new research that enables better understanding of the reach, capability and effectiveness of antitrust enforcement to promote competition in digital markets and to develop approaches to encourage more vigorous application of antitrust laws.</p><p>Led by: Diana Moss</p><p>American Enterprise Institute ($400,000): To support a new digital governance project at AEI aimed at helping policymakers understand the key questions and issues at the intersection of technology and public policy.</p><p>Led by: Jim Harper, Yuval Levin, Shane Tews, Adam White</p><p>Berkeley Center for Law and Technology ($40,000): To support a symposium at the UC Berkeley School of Law on the roles of technology in internet law and policy that will culminate in a published volume of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal, as well as an accompanying seminar and workshop.</p><p>Led by: Deirdre Mulligan</p><p>Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;#38; Society at Harvard University ($250,000): To support the launch of a refined and expanded version of the Assembly initiative focused on online disinformation.</p><p>Led by: Jonathan Zittrain</p><p>Duke University Center on Law &amp;#38; Tech ($75,000): To support research that explores the applicability of the principles and priorities of traditional media and public utility regulation to the regulatory framework applied to social media platforms and associated data.</p><p>Led by: Philip M.

Knight Foundation:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Funding will help universities, think tanks and advocacy groups fill gaps in research needed by federal policymakers and other decision-makers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIAMI Nov. 3, 2019 The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation has announced more than $3.5 million in funding to support new, independent research into issues at the forefront of national tech policy debates. Twenty-two universities, think tanks and advocacy organizations will study diverse, timely topics including content moderation by social media companies, antitrust enforcement in big tech and the pervasive problem of disinformation online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research, intended for near-term application, will help meet the urgent needs of federal lawmakers and other decision-makers as they shape the future of the internet, as the impact of technology on our society and democracy becomes ever more significant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These issues are moving faster than we can evaluate and analyze them. We need to close the knowledge gap, if our society is going to make smart decisions about how to ensure technology strengthens democracy rather than weakening it, said Sam Gill, vice president at Knight Foundation. Knight is investing in and supporting this research to ensure that a diverse range of views and a body of real evidence informs urgent policy debates. How we answer the questions of today will shape the American democracy of tomorrow.</p><p>The institutions receiving new Knight support were selected through an open funding opportunity to expand fundamental research on the norms, rights and responsibilities that govern digital services, in particular, social media. The funding opportunity is ongoing.</p><p>Research topics include the responsibilities of social media companies and digital service providers with regard to how they moderate, police and present content that increasingly informs our national civic conversation, and issues of antitrust and competition in the online arena. Both reflect ongoing debates on Capitol Hill and critical conversations in Silicon Valley.</p><p>In recent months, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have held hearings on questions of market power, antitrust, technology companies use of algorithms and their accountability in enabling online extremism and violence. This has prompted policymakers to consider whether, and to what extent, to change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from legal liability over content posted by their users.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have separate ongoing investigations into the competition and business practices of several tech companies. Additionally, almost all state attorneys general are investigating both Google and Facebook for anti-competitive behavior. And, last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced intense scrutiny by members of the House Financial Services Committee regarding the companys cryptocurrency plans and its role in society at large.</p><p>The investments are part of Knights recently announced $50 million commitment to support research on how technology is transforming our democracy and the way in which people are informed in the digital age. The foundation committed nearly $45 million earlier this year to support long-term research at American universities, research institutions and think tanks.</p><p>The full list of Knights new research investments includes:</p><p>American Antitrust Institute ($100,000): To support new research that enables better understanding of the reach, capability and effectiveness of antitrust enforcement to promote competition in digital markets and to develop approaches to encourage more vigorous application of antitrust laws.</p><p>Led by: Diana Moss</p><p>American Enterprise Institute ($400,000): To support a new digital governance project at AEI aimed at helping policymakers understand the key questions and issues at the intersection of technology and public policy.</p><p>Led by: Jim Harper, Yuval Levin, Shane Tews, Adam White</p><p>Berkeley Center for Law and Technology ($40,000): To support a symposium at the UC Berkeley School of Law on the roles of technology in internet law and policy that will culminate in a published volume of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal, as well as an accompanying seminar and workshop.</p><p>Led by: Deirdre Mulligan</p><p>Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University ($250,000): To support the launch of a refined and expanded version of the Assembly initiative focused on online disinformation.</p><p>Led by: Jonathan Zittrain</p><p>Duke University Center on Law and Tech ($75,000): To support research that explores the applicability of the principles and priorities of traditional media and public utility regulation to the regulatory framework applied to social media platforms and associated data.</p><p>Led by: Philip M.

Government should not be empowered to pick winners and losers in the marketplace,\" said AFP Senior Tech Policy Analyst Billy Easley upon the ads' launch. \"To prevent a politicization of an important process, antitrust decisions should be made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice -- not by political leaders campaigning for elected office. We want to remind lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not to be used as a political weapon.\"</p><p>But history and economics -- and traditional free-market thought -- aren't on AFP's side.</p><p>Antitrust has always been a \"political process\" -- the president picks who heads the Department of Justice (DOJ), after all, and Warren is not the first presidential candidate to draw attention to an industry's anticompetitive practices. President Theodore Roosevelt campaigned on antitrust issues (then called \"trust busting\"), and President Donald Trump regularly comments on what he calls the tech industry's \"antitrust situation.\"</p><p>Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project, a project of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which seeks to \"increase scrutiny on executive branch appointments and ensure that political appointees are focused on serving the public interest rather than personal or professional advancement,\" wrote in an op-ed that, \"American antitrust law is built upon the timeless insight that the ability of dominant corporations' to sustain dominance unfairly threatens our economic and political liberty. Since unfettered corporations can entrench themselves unfairly, competition regulators should block both mergers and corporate practices that allow already powerful corporations to stifle would-be competitors.\"</p><p>Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890 and the Federal Trade Commission Act (creating the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC) and the Clayton Act in 1914 to stop big companies from forming anticompetitive mergers and establishing anticompetitive monopolies or oligopolies in various industries.</p><p>The infamous 1911 Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States case prompted the latter two laws, because the Sherman Act did not adequately address Standard Oil's anticompetitive practices.</p><p>Standard Oil, started by John D. Rockefeller, routinely underpriced suppliers who did business with oil competitors, and negotiated price fixing agreements with oil refiners and railroads shipping the oil. In doing so, Standard Oil prevented other entrepreneurs and innovators from entering and competing in the oil market.</p><p>Progressives and conservatives agree such behavior is anticompetitive, anti-consumer and anti-free market. In U.S. economic history, both left- and right-leaning administrations brought antitrust litigation against big business, from Taft to Reagan to Clinton.</p><p>Today, both left- and right-leaning economists identify monopolistic tendencies and anticompetitive practices within the tech industry, especially with Amazon, which employs anticompetitive practices similar to that of Standard Oil.</p><p>A range of economists and law professors told Senate Democrats and Republicans that antitrust enforcement against Big Tech may be a legitimate way to deal with some of the tech industry's problems, although there is still some debate over how to measure market power and price within the tech industry, and how to define \"consumer benefit\" and \"consumer harm.\"</p><p>Hauser notes in his op-ed that where the tech industry is concerned, \"America's cops on the competition beat have grown lazy. They are not enforcing antitrust laws passed during the first Gilded Age to level a playing field tilted by powerful corporations for their own benefit; that's why America is stuck in a second Gilded Age of economic inequality. These officials have been lulled to sleep by decades of corporate-funded pseudo-economics.\"</p><p>Some economists argue that economic inequality often correlates with market concentration, although it isn't clear whether antitrust enforcement causes economic inequality to decrease.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren tweeted a response to AFP last week: \"Oh look -- the Koch brothers don't like my ideas. Apparently they're horrified about any effort to try and rein in the economic and political power of giant corporations. I'm shocked.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

The list of principles is a marker for policymakers, businesses and lobbyists to understand where the Koch Network stands and what it wants to accomplish.</p><p> The new push is designed to get companies to resist political officials' efforts to \"launder power\" and oppose activists working to restrict speech online, said Jesse Blumenthal, Stand Together vice president and Charles Koch Institute director of technology and innovation.</p><p> \"I think there's a real void in the space where there are a number of activists both on the left and on the right that are trying to co-opt political pressure on businesses into pursuing short-term goals at the expense of long-term values,\" Mr. Blumenthal said. \"I think it's an opportunity to articulate a better way.\"</p><p> The Koch Network's new tilt toward tech policy will involve many groups, including well-known entities such as Americans for Prosperity and the Charles Koch Institute. The new advocacy effort will be focused on business, as opposed to many of its other projects aiming at affecting government, and intends to build on the network's shift toward policy goals over political outcomes.</p><p> As part of its ongoing efforts, the Charles Koch Institute and its accompanying foundation were among the sponsors of the \"State of the Net Conference\" in Washington on Tuesday. The conference, which bills itself as the \"largest Internet policy conference in the U.S.,\" is run by the Internet Education Foundation and brings together 300 congressional staff and federal policymakers from the White House, departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, and State among others.</p><p> Speakers at Tuesday's conference included Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Washington Republican; Sen. Roger Wicker, Mississippi Republican; and Ellen Weintraub, a Democratic commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. Lead sponsors of the event include Comcast, Facebook, Microsoft and Verizon.</p><p> Mr. Blumenthal, who also addressed the conference, said much of the conversation he looked to foster Tuesday surrounded free expression and the role of government online and in the private sector. The public release of the Koch Network's new tech policy agenda was \"industry and business model agnostic,\" Mr. Blumenthal said, as part of an effort to reach the widest audience possible.</p><p> Several tech policy influence efforts have been mounted in recent months from both the left and the right. The Lincoln Network is building a right-leaning coalition that meets in private in Silicon Valley to wield greater influence over the tech sector, while the liberal public relations firm Unbendable Media has aimed at targets such as Facebook for being insufficiently progressive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-178C4FD86B849C18</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y38-1YV1-DXVP-V1XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>29 January 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

During H1'20, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.</p><p>Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world - and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1'20, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter - and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.</p><p>Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1'20 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1'20, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.</p><p>\"The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring.

The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) - with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.</p><p>The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).</p><p>Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe</p><p>Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals.

During H1'20, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.</p><p>Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world - and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1'20, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter - and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.</p><p>Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1'20 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1'20, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.</p><p>\"The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent,\" said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"The intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions - particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.\"</p><p>2020 Key Highlights</p><p>-Global fintech investment is well behind 2019's total investment of $150.4 billion.

During H1'20, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.</p><p>Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world - and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1'20, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter - and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.</p><p>Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1'20 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1'20, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.</p><p>\"The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent,\" said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"The intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions - particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.\"</p><p>2020 Key Highlights</p><p>-Global fintech investment is well behind 2019's total investment of $150.4 billion. At mid-year, total fintech investment globally is $25.6 billion.</p><p>-The Americas accounted for the largest share of total fintech investment at mid-year, with $12.9 billion investment. ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1'20, while EMEA saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment.</p><p>-The Americas and EMEA are currently on track to see a new record annual high of VC investment in fintech. At the end of H1'20, the Americas had attracted $9.3 billion in VC investment, Asia had attracted $6.7 billion, and EMEA had attracted $4 billion.</p><p>-Corporate VC participating investment remained very strong, accounting for $12.2 billion in fintech investment globally. The US saw a record in VC deal value with corporate participation well over $2.4 billion in Q1 2020; the following quarter nearly matched that same amount.</p><p>-M&amp;A activity dropped in all regions of the world - a sharp decline due to the mega M&amp;A activity seen during 2018 and 2019. During H1'20, global M&amp;A deals accounted for $4 billion globally, compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19.</p><p>-Global investment in cybersecurity flew past 2019's record high of $592.3 million, reaching $870.8 million.</p><p>US sees lion's share of fintech investment in Americas</p><p>The Americas saw a steep decline in fintech funding, with $12.9 billion of investment in H1'20 compared to $43.3 billion in H2'20. Plummeting M&amp;A investment was responsible for the decline as VC investment in the region was on record pace - with $9.3 billion raised by the end of H1'20. The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) - with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.</p><p>The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).</p><p>Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe</p><p>Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals. During H1'20, the region saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. VC investment in fintech remained strong in H1'20, accounting for US$4 billion in investment.</p><p>During H1'20, challenger banks attracted five of the 10 largest deals in EMEA, including Germany-based N26 ($570 million), UK-based Revolut ($500 million), Sweden-based Klarna ($200 million), UK-based Starling Bank ($123 million), and France-based Qonto (US$116 million).</p><p>Southeast Asia becomes hotspot for fintech activity</p><p>ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1'20, led by the US$3 billion funding round by Indonesia-based Gojek, an $886 million raise by Gojek's main competitor - Singapore-based Grab, and a $398 million raise by India-based Navi Technologies. Fintech investment in ASPAC was quite diverse from a regional perspective this quarter. In addition to Indonesia, Singapore and India, Japan (Paidy: $251 million), South Korean (KSNET: $237 million), and Australia (Airwallex: $160 million, Judo Bank: $147 million) also saw large fintech deals. Fintech investment in China remained suppressed, falling to a multi-quarter low in Q2'20.</p><p>Government regulatory efforts were a very strong trend in ASPAC. During H2'20, Australia re-opened submissions to its Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology in order to understand how COVID-19 has affected the fintech sector, while Singapore introduced a licensing program for digital asset exchanges and platforms and Hong Kong (SAR) introduced an 'opt-in' licensing program for digital assets exchanges.</p><p>Corporate fintech investment robust in face of COVID-19</p><p>Corporate investment in fintech remained very strong in H1'20, accounting for $12.2 billion in investment across participating deals globally. The US was particularly notable as it saw a record high of over $2.4 billion in corporate investment in Q1'20 - a number almost matched in Q2'20. Corporate investment is expected to remain very strong heading into H2'20, in part due to the strategic nature of investments driven by corporates making investments in digital channels and products in order to serve their customers better in the COVID-19 era.</p><p>Accelerated digital trends will shape fintech's future</p><p>COVID-19 will remain key driver of change for fintech investment heading into H2'20 given the strong acceleration of digital trends - such as the use of contactless payments and the demand for and use of digital service models. The ongoing acceleration of digital trends will drive fintech investment not only in direct fintech solutions, but also in related enabling technologies - such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention and digital identity management. Platform businesses will also continue to be a hot ticket for investors, particularly in less mature jurisdictions.</p><p>\"Over the remainder of 2020, we will likely see investors continuing to focus on late stage deals and safe bets given the current uncertainty. This will likely create challenges for less mature fintechs who could find themselves running out of cash and struggling to raise additional funding,\" said Anton Ruddenklau, Global Fintech Co-Leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"In H2'20, there will likely be an increasing number of opportunistic investments by corporates and PE firms look for good deals.\"</p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TN-PP21-F06S-P0S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345185</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

During H1'20, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.</p><p>Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world - and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1'20, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter - and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.</p><p>Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1'20 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1'20, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.</p><p>\"The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent,\" said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"The intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions - particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.\"</p><p>2020 Key Highlights</p><p>-Global fintech investment is well behind 2019's total investment of $150.4 billion. At mid-year, total fintech investment globally is $25.6 billion.</p><p>-The Americas accounted for the largest share of total fintech investment at mid-year, with $12.9 billion investment. ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1'20, while EMEA saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment.</p><p>-The Americas and EMEA are currently on track to see a new record annual high of VC investment in fintech. At the end of H1'20, the Americas had attracted $9.3 billion in VC investment, Asia had attracted $6.7 billion, and EMEA had attracted $4 billion.</p><p>-Corporate VC participating investment remained very strong, accounting for $12.2 billion in fintech investment globally. The US saw a record in VC deal value with corporate participation well over $2.4 billion in Q1 2020; the following quarter nearly matched that same amount.</p><p>-M&amp;A activity dropped in all regions of the world - a sharp decline due to the mega M&amp;A activity seen during 2018 and 2019. During H1'20, global M&amp;A deals accounted for $4 billion globally, compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19.</p><p>-Global investment in cybersecurity flew past 2019's record high of $592.3 million, reaching $870.8 million.</p><p>US sees lion's share of fintech investment in Americas</p><p>The Americas saw a steep decline in fintech funding, with $12.9 billion of investment in H1'20 compared to $43.3 billion in H2'20. Plummeting M&amp;A investment was responsible for the decline as VC investment in the region was on record pace - with $9.3 billion raised by the end of H1'20. The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) - with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.</p><p>The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).</p><p>Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe</p><p>Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals. During H1'20, the region saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. VC investment in fintech remained strong in H1'20, accounting for US$4 billion in investment.</p><p>During H1'20, challenger banks attracted five of the 10 largest deals in EMEA, including Germany-based N26 ($570 million), UK-based Revolut ($500 million), Sweden-based Klarna ($200 million), UK-based Starling Bank ($123 million), and France-based Qonto (US$116 million).</p><p>Southeast Asia becomes hotspot for fintech activity</p><p>ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1'20, led by the US$3 billion funding round by Indonesia-based Gojek, an $886 million raise by Gojek's main competitor - Singapore-based Grab, and a $398 million raise by India-based Navi Technologies. Fintech investment in ASPAC was quite diverse from a regional perspective this quarter. In addition to Indonesia, Singapore and India, Japan (Paidy: $251 million), South Korean (KSNET: $237 million), and Australia (Airwallex: $160 million, Judo Bank: $147 million) also saw large fintech deals. Fintech investment in China remained suppressed, falling to a multi-quarter low in Q2'20.</p><p>Government regulatory efforts were a very strong trend in ASPAC. During H2'20, Australia re-opened submissions to its Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology in order to understand how COVID-19 has affected the fintech sector, while Singapore introduced a licensing program for digital asset exchanges and platforms and Hong Kong (SAR) introduced an 'opt-in' licensing program for digital assets exchanges.</p><p>Corporate fintech investment robust in face of COVID-19</p><p>Corporate investment in fintech remained very strong in H1'20, accounting for $12.2 billion in investment across participating deals globally. The US was particularly notable as it saw a record high of over $2.4 billion in corporate investment in Q1'20 - a number almost matched in Q2'20. Corporate investment is expected to remain very strong heading into H2'20, in part due to the strategic nature of investments driven by corporates making investments in digital channels and products in order to serve their customers better in the COVID-19 era.</p><p>Accelerated digital trends will shape fintech's future</p><p>COVID-19 will remain key driver of change for fintech investment heading into H2'20 given the strong acceleration of digital trends - such as the use of contactless payments and the demand for and use of digital service models. The ongoing acceleration of digital trends will drive fintech investment not only in direct fintech solutions, but also in related enabling technologies - such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention and digital identity management. Platform businesses will also continue to be a hot ticket for investors, particularly in less mature jurisdictions.</p><p>\"Over the remainder of 2020, we will likely see investors continuing to focus on late stage deals and safe bets given the current uncertainty. This will likely create challenges for less mature fintechs who could find themselves running out of cash and struggling to raise additional funding,\" said Anton Ruddenklau, Global Fintech Co-Leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"In H2'20, there will likely be an increasing number of opportunistic investments by corporates and PE firms look for good deals.\"</p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WNCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WNCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-HTB1-F06S-P3CY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AppleAAPL[4], AlphabetGOOGL[5] and Amazon AMZN[6].Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day[7]:Kratos Defenseis a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is the Bull of the Day. Clearly there are lots of stocks out there with positive earnings estimate revisions, but I chose this one becuase it has a super solid chart. Right now, I want stocks that have strong charts which implies that investors are not willing to sell them even in rough patches.DescriptionKratos Defense ...curity Solutions, Inc.</p><p>is a specialized National Security Technology business providing mission critical products, services and solutions for United States National Security priorities. Kratos' core capabilities are sophisticated engineering, manufacturing and system integration offerings for National Security platforms and programs.Earnings HistoryI see a great history of beating the number for KTOS, with each of the last four reports coming in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The average positive earnings surprise is 154% -- so they are destroying the number on a regular basis.EstimatesEstimates are actually a little flat here, with the current quarter holding at 7 cents and next quarter holding at 10 cents. The full year saw an increase of 2 cents, but that is actually beyond the 60 day time frame the rank focuses on, so that move should not count.A healthy 6 cent increase for 2020 is the move that I see impacting the rank the most and it comes with 4 revisions all in agreement, so that really helps the cause.ValuationSo the valuation is stiff here, with a 66x forward PE and a 4.6x book multiple. I see 12% topline growth and I was really expecting more. Operating margins are moving higher, but at only 3.5% we would need to see big revenue growth to make a meaningful impact on EPS.Bear of the Day[8]:CDW Corpis a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and it is the Bear of the Day, but there is still a lot to like here. Let's take a deeper look how this stock became the Bear of the Day and if you should gamble on this play with earnings coming in just a few days.DescriptionCDW Corporation offers information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers primarily in the United States and Canada. Its hardware products comprise network communications, notebooks/mobile devices, data storage, video monitors, printers, desktops and servers as well as NetComm products. The company's software services include licensing, licensing management, software solutions and services. In addition, it offers configuration services which include virtualization, collaboration, security, mobility, data centre optimization and cloud computing. CDW Corporation is headquartered in Vernon Hills, Illinois.Earnings HistoryThis stock has a great earnings history. The company has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. The average postiive earnings surprise is 8.9%.This is clearly not the reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Estimate RevisionsThe estimate picture is actually a very good one. There are a few negative revisions, but on the whole, I like what I see.The 2019 full year number slipped to $5.74 from $5.77 -- but then jumped right back to the prior level. This negative revision, along with two negative revisions for the 2020 number are the only negatives that I see.ValuationI really like what I see here, with a 19x forward earnings multiple and solid top line growth of around 10%. THe 17x price to book is rather high, but the 1x price sales tells me that the market values the sales of its services and products.In summary, the slight negatives on the estimate revisions are things that investors need to be ok with if they want to be in this stock ahead of earnings. The company is slated to report before the open on July 31.What to Expect from Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Next WeekApple is set to report its third quarter earnings on July 30th after the closing bell. The company has been facing uncertainties from the trade war that escalated in early May, and this has investors wondering how drastic the repercussions would be on AAPL. Additionally, Apple is also under federal investigation for possible antitrust violations, which has warranted further questions about what could be in store for the tech giant. Not only is the company facing litigation on the home front but it is also under investigation by the European Union as well. While AAPL is in the midst of surrounding uncertainties, let's take a further look into the company and how they might report their Q3 performance.Recent News and Company Overview Federal regulators have been putting the heat on Big Tech as the U.S. Department of Justice is running the investigation of Apple and Alphabet while the Federal Trade Commission will have lead oversight of Amazon and others.Last Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an investigation into the practices of market-leading online platforms. The DOJ is reviewing whether these companies are engaging in practices that reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives commented that the objective standard for the investigation is whether a company engages in anticompetitive behavior, thereby driving up prices for consumers. The objective standard differs in Europe as it is more focused on the impact of monopolies on smaller competitors with dominant market positions being frowned upon as a result.In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Apple released an iPad air and an updated iPad mini with Apple Pencil capabilities. The company also updated the iMac and the Air Pods with the option of a wireless charging case.The company also announced its emergence in the subscription service realm. Apple announced that they would be releasing the subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+, amongst other services and products. This attempt to enter the subscription-based services market could bode well for the company in the long run if they can learn to compete with the industry's top players. Apple has been able to put together a solid year thus far; the tech giant is currently up 31.5% and has significantly outpaced the S...00. The company's continued focus on boosting its services business has been a key catalyst in driving the company's growth.Q2 Performance and Q3 Outlook Apple was able to bring in a quarterly revenue of $58 billion and reported earnings of $2.46, which were down 5% and 10% respectively from Q2 2018. Despite the year over year falloff, the company was able to beat our Consensus Earnings Estimate by 3.8% and revenue estimate by 0.8%. The tech giant's profits also took a year over year hit, generating $11.6 billion and dropping 16.3%. iPhone sales were down 17.3% to $31 billion while Mac and iPad products brought in $5.51 billion and $4.87 billion, respectively. Apple's services sector jumped 16.2% by bringing in $11.45 billion in Q2 2019. Furthermore, the wearables, home, and accessories segment increased 30% with revenue of $5.13 billion. Weak iPhone demand in China continued to plague the company in Q2, as net sales in Greater China fell 21.5% with $10.2 billion.For Q3, our Consensus Estimates are currently calling for earnings to drop 10.26% to $2.10 per share and revenue to be $53.3 billion for a slight increase from the year ago quarter. Our Key Company Metric Estimates are projecting for the company's iPhone demand struggle to continue in Q3 with $26.1 billion, which would be a 12.8% drop. iPad revenue is expected to continue its growth in Q3 with $5.14 billion in revenue, growing 8.32% year over year. The company's services revenue is forecasted to increase 22.6% with $11.7 billion. Wearables, Home, and Accessories Estimates are calling for a 33.3% jump from Q3 2018 with a revenue of $4.99 billion. Key Company Metric Estimates are also calling for the company's China revenue to increase to $9.71 billion, which is a slight recovery from the struggles the company has faced.Bottom Line Apple's non-iPhone businesses, in particular the Services and Wearables sectors, are expected to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2019. AAPL currently has more than 390 million paid subscribers across its services portfolio. The company's development into a variety of services and products lessen the dependence the company has on iPhone sales which in turn can supplement the company's growth in the long run. Apple Music currently has more than 50 million paid subscribers and its availability on Amazon Echo devices can expand the streaming platform's market share. Uncertainties over the trade war between Washington and Beijing will continue to plague the company as long as there is no trade deal. Furthermore, the litigation the company is facing from the U.S. and the European Union are significant headwinds for shareholders in the near term.This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best-performing stocks you'll find anywhere in the market.

As we stated in the Open Letter[2] of European security experts, the EEAS East STRATCOM Team must be at least tripled in size and receive a budget in the single millions of EUR, so it can start fulfilling its mandate in real terms. Only three experts in the EEAS East STRATCOM Team are tasked with countering pro-Kremlin disinformation, which means that Federica Mogherini still doesn't take this threat seriously. Even if there is no language variant of Sputnik in your country, fringe groups and 'alternative' media can do even more damage than official Russian channels. </p><p>It should be part of each country's basic hygiene and self-defence to investigate the possible links, whether financial or ideological, of such entities to the Kremlin. Groups like the Baltic Elves are a good way to go. In context of the US investigation regarding the role of social media in the Russian-linked election meddling, we should start looking into regulation for public advertising. Google recently removed RT (formerly Russia Today) from Google Preferred, 'a package of premium YouTube video inventory that the company sells to advertisers'. But we cannot expect social media companies to do all the work and then place RT advertisement on the walls of every tube station in London and other capitals. Detailed public scrutiny of RT's activities, as well as those of other Russian media and proxies, must start happening now. <url normalizedValue=\"http://track.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT03MzQ1MzM4MjU5NzkyMjEzNDEmYz1zMXA2JmI9MTI5MjIxMzA3JmQ9bTZxMmcxdw==.Ympod8lt0GKYGU6vtf0N2ZRSr15T2GmbrjRlKxmb6vsGood\">http://track.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT03MzQ1MzM4MjU5NzkyMjEzNDEmYz1zMXA2JmI9MTI5MjIxMzA3JmQ9bTZxMmcxdw==.Ympod8lt0GKYGU6vtf0N2ZRSr15T2GmbrjRlKxmb6vsGood</url> Old Soviet JokeThis is Armenian Radio; our listeners asked us: 'Why did butter disappear from the stores' shelves?' We're answering: 'It all has melted under the\u00a0sun of the Soviet Constitution.'US Developments Big Tech in the spotlight: Updates on the Russia election probeCongressional investigators are drawing the conclusion[3] that the pathway 'to understanding Russia's election meddling runs through the technology industry'. Facebook, Twitter, and Google - companies that retain enormous power over users and information - are facing growing scrutiny about their role in enabling Russia's disinformation efforts during the election. New reports detail how Russia faked 'black activism'[4] and organized protests to seed discontent in the US, while a roundup[5] of the ads purchased by Russia-linked groups identifies a focus on topics related to Black Lives Matter, LGBT, Muslims, immigration, and militancy. (This article[6] explains how simple it is to buy a Facebook ad just like the troll operatives at the St Petersburg troll factory.) It has also been determined that Wisconsin and Michigan[7] - two crucial swing states that went to Trump - were the key targets of the Facebook ads. Facing the pressure of impending public hearings, the Big Tech platforms are scrambling to conduct internal examinations and demonstrate cooperation with lawmakers. Google is undertaking[8] a broad internal investigation of Russian-linked entities using its ads or services to manipulate voters whilst simultaneously speaking with congressional officials. In addition, Google recently removed[9] RT (formerly Russia Today) from Google Preferred, 'a package of premium YouTube video inventory that the company sells to advertisers'. Twitter's policy chief has also briefed Congress about Russia's exploitation of the platform; however, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence criticized[10] the presentation as 'inadequate on almost every level', implying that the company failed to understand the extent of the threat to American democracy. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg expressed regret[11] for having dismissed as 'crazy' the notion that Facebook was used as a channel for fake news to sway the election.The fight isn't overThe heads of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Richard Burr (R-NC) and Mark Warner (D-VA) have jointly declared[12] that Russia's disinformation campaign is not over, and warned that further manipulation efforts should be expected in the upcoming November and 2018 congressional elections.The Kremlin's Current Narrative Future of EuropeOur favourite online journal Vzglyad[13] analysed the current state of play in Europe after the German elections and the Catalonian referendum, concluding that Europe is effectively entering a new stage in its history. European integration is going to destroy nation states if the main engine of the process, Germany, does not stop it. Vzglyad predicts the integration process will speed up and the EU will become more centralized. The only possible alternative is an exchange of elites and, above all, active rejection of the path of violent integration. Who promotes these ideas? Of course, the National Front and AfD! So yes, Vzglyad, loudspeaker of the Russian governmental institutions, predicts that these parties will save Europe. Happy times ahead of us.Adoption of the 'Canadian Magnitsky Act'Russia is profoundly disappointed by the adoption of the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act by the Canadian Parliament on October 2. This act, inspired by the American Magnitsky Act, will, according to Russia, further undermine Russian-Canadian relations, as it is explicitly designed to introduce sanctions against Russian citizens. Russia has warned Canada that this action will not go unanswered, meaning Moscow will expand the list of Canadian officials banned from entering Russia. But Moscow is trying to be the bigger person here and still hopes that common sense will prevail in Ottawa. The Russian narrative has not changed over the past years as Moscow claims that attempts to isolate Russia have failed and that the West is likewise trying to isolate itself from Russia (big question mark about this logic). And here is the favourite line of all - this policy is actually harming the interests of the West, in particular by obstructing joint efforts to combat terrorism, bilateral cooperation in the Arctic and other areas. However, we are not convinced that Russia is genuinely interested in joint efforts to combat terrorism as Moscow continues to criticize its allies on Syria.Clash with BBC and double standardsMoscow has been complaining about Simon Reeve's documentary film about Russia, recently aired on BBC Two, which addresses the journey of British journalists to the Russian Far East and is timed for the centenary of the Russian Revolution. Moscow had a lot to say about the poor quality and politicization of the topic and dismissed the crew's statements about their experiences of harassment and detention by the Russian security agencies. Moscow not only downplayed these claims but accused the BBC of broadcasting Russophobic stereotypes instead of reality. Indeed, that story made it into the Russian Foreign Ministry's fake news section. This story, meanwhile, goes into our fake news section.PUTIN'S CHAMPION AWARDOur\u00a0Expert Jury[14]\u00a0consisting of\u00a0Jessikka Aro, Peter Kreko, Nerijus Maliukevi\u010dius, Anton Shekhovtsov and John Schindler,\u00a0regularly votes on the dangerousness of several candidates you can nominate via e-mail or Twitter.

K Zhestovskaya/(CC BY-SA 3.0) The Expert Jury ranked his Putin-supportive job with 3,7 (of out 5) mark.Policy ...search News The Kremlin's little helpers in RomaniaThe Kremlin's disinformation campaign operates in variety of ways. It is not always sufficient to be aware of official channels like Sputnik or RT. In many countries, the propaganda machine consists of many little helpers, like radical and fringe movements or the so-called 'alternative' media. Due to economic interests, desire for popularity, or pure adoration of Putin and/or the Russian machine, these proxies can help amplify the Kremlin's messages without citizens noticing that they are being manipulated. In an article for CEPA's StratCom Program, Corina Rebegea noticed that such a case recently happened in Romania. The result was a petition to declare Hans Klemm, the U.S. ambassador to Bucharest, persona non-grata.Germany's AfD and United Russia in subtle symbiosisThe Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics published the preliminary results[16] of their monitoring of the attempts to influence German elections. After continuous[17] rapprochement[18] between Germany's AfD and Russia's United Russia over the last year, perhaps their report presents no real surprise. It describes mutual assistance between the AfD and pro-Kremlin actors via media coverage and Twitter bots. Also worrying is the assertion that even CDU politicians sometimes helped amplify and spread disinformation messaging originating in Russian tabloids.Finnish COE established, Mogherini respondsThe Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats became operational[19] in the beginning of the month. It has been established by the Finnish government. Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States are currently participating[20] in its activities. The EU High Representative Federica Mogherini welcomed[21] the establishment of the Center at the conference in Brussels dedicated to hybrid threats and the EU. She stated that 'We are all affected, in Europe and beyond, and we all need to mobilise with the means and the resources at our disposal. This is what the European Union is doing already and we couldn't take this issue more seriously.' Unfortunately, her statements mostly highlight her shallow understanding of the problem and avoidance of real action. During her speech, she praised the activities of the Hybrid Fusion Cell, a low-key body within the EU, which is tasked with analysing hybrid threats. In comparison, she mentions the EEAS StratCom Task Force, which is doing the most tough but potentially game-changing job, only once. When it comes to the main culprit of the whole problem, the Russian Federation, the number of mentions is - unsurprisingly - zero.Kremlin Watch Reading Suggestion Russian think tanks and soft power [22]Russia uses many different tools to boost its international influence; some of them, like disinformation or the use of cyber warfare, attract a lot of attention, while others are largely overlooked. One of these latter mechanisms is trying to influence expert communities and wider public opinion in the West using the help of think tanks and similar government-organized non-governmental organizations (GONGOs), which is exactly what this[23] report by the Swedish Defence Research Agency focuses on. The report offers a comprehensive overview of this issue and also contains nine case studies of specific think tanks. What is remarkable about Russian think tanks is their high dependency on the Russian government. Although it is normal for think tanks in the West to cooperate with or receive funding from their respective governments, the independence of think tanks in Russia is much more limited. All of the think tanks examined in the report also seek in varying degrees to promote the country's official message. Moreover, it is evident in various Russian security documents that the Russian government wants to use think tanks and GONGOs to achieve its foreign policy goals. Overall, the extent to which the think tanks and GONGOs tend to promote the country's official agenda varies, with the ones that have the widest interface with reputable Western researchers being less propagandistic. The ones that convey the Russian official message more obviously often create networks with less mainstream (and sometimes more extremist) organizations in the West. To find out about specific think tanks and more, have a look at the report. Kremlin Watch is a strategic program of the European Values Think-Tank, which aims to expose and confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against liberal-democratic system.

Whilethe United States intensifies its efforts to counter Russian cyber-attacksin allied countries, it might be overlookingsignificant loopholes in its own justice system. More and more countries are trying to fulfil their goals by leveraging digital tools and social media networks to spread disinformation, includingIran, North Korea, China, and Russia, a new study says.Good Old Soviet JokeEstonia asked Gorbachev to allow it to be independent just for one month. Gorbachev refused. </p><p>Then Estonia requested independence for just one day. Gorbachev refused. Then Estonia asked only ten minutes of independence. Gorbachev's advisors suggested to comply with that request as in ten minutes Estonians wouldn't be able to do much harm, but to consent to their request could be advantageous for propaganda purposes. Ten minutes of independence elapsed, and the Soviet agents in Estonia reported, 'In the first five minutes, Estonia proclaimed war to Finland, and in the next five minutes Estonia surrendered and announced that it had been occupied byFinland.'Policy ...search News Half of all Europeans may have been exposed to disinformationSeveralmajor news sources[1]this week reported that 241 million Europeans may have been exposed to social media disinformation linked to Russia, according to the online security firm SafeGuard Cyber. 6,700 automated bots posted and amplified material, which was not general, but rather locally targeted with a different narrative fitting each state. In Britain, the amplified news focused on Theresa May's Brexit deal, in France - on a speech by the French President Emmanuel Macron about the future of Europe and in Germany the focus were issues surrounding immigration and Syrian refugees. SafeGuard Cyber, which produced the research, said it had a database of more than 500,000 known troll and bot accounts and had the confidence of their Russian links after examining the content of their posts, location, time of posting and relationship to other bots. More worryingly, the issue seems to have encouragedfar-right copycats[2]who often echo Kremlin's talking points, making it difficult to discern which is which. Conspiracy theories about the Notre-Dame fire and misinformation about immigrants, NATO and the EU prevail. Often information is generated by Russia and later amplified by other actors on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms. This underlines a worrying trend which not only supports the Kremlin's political aim of undermining the European Union and other Western institutions but also undermines legitimate political debate within Europe itself.Two Russian agents are convicted for the Montenegro coup plotA Montenegrin court on Thursday found14 people guilty[3]of plotting a coup d'etat to prevent Montenegro from joining NATO. The 2016 Montenegro's Parliamentary election was widely viewed as a referendum on Montenegro's NATO membership, which was had already been agreed to but had not yet taken place and remained controversial. The case revealed new evidence on several recent events suspected to be GRU Operations, most notably the Salisbury poisoning. The two Russians suspected to be connected to GRU were tried in absentia and are unlikely to serve their sentences. While their links to GRU remain controversial, particularly as the operation failed spectacularly, some inexplicable issues remain. The photo of the fake passport of one of the Russians accused matches that of a man previously expelled from Poland for espionage. Their (fake) passport numbers are close to those of other men accused of conducting Kremlin's operations abroad, especially the two accused of the Sergei Skripal poisoning, as has previously been analysed by Bellingcat. Money for the coup plot was sent via Western Union from the GRU headquarters in Moscow. While the links remain unproven, the similarities of the case with other recent Russian operations in the West point to a very possible Kremlin's presence in protecting its interests in Montenegro.Macron suggests big tech companies need to be regulated like banksPoliticoreported[4]this week that recentmajor research[5]commissioned by the French government suggests big social media companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Youtube should be regulated like the financial sector. This would include regular audits and more transparency on their internal processes, particularly when it comes to regulating hate speech and other harmful content. The report, which was non-binding, was generally well received by Facebook. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed hopes that this regulatory framework could become not just a model for France, but the rest of the European Union as well. The report, which was authored by former Google employee and telecoms regulator official Benoit Loutrel, calls for stricter oversight over processes for removing and preventing hate speech instead of policing individual failures. The French President has previously attempted to reign in big-tech companies, including pioneering legislation on fake news and pushing for a digital tax.US Developments Intensifying efforts to counter Russian cyber-attacks in allied countriesThe United States has been intensifying the efforts to counter the Kremlin's subversion operations in allied countries, like Ukraine, Macedonia and Montenegro, and put a bigger cost on Moscow in the area of cyber-security. According to the American officials, the aim is to defend elections and uncover information about the modern cyber-capabilities of the Russian Federation. The United States Cyber Command intends to expand to more countries which find themselves under attacks. Maj. Gen. Charles L. Moore, the director of operations for Cyber Command, toldThe New York Times[6]: 'We recognize and understand the importance of being in constant contact with the enemy in this space, especially below the level of armed conflict, so we can defend ourselves and we can impose costs.'U.S. justice system is being manipulated by RussiaNewsweek[7]presents several examples of how the Russian Federation is manipulating the American justice system, which according to several experts is 'ill-equipped to respond to politically motivated cases from abroad and to Russia's manipulation of the system,' while often using American law firms. One of the examples is the case of Concord Management, a Russian company owned by Evgene Prigozhin which was indicted for funding the St. Petersburg troll factory. The team of the special counsel Robert Mueller warned against the company to be handed over sensitive documents included in the Mueller report in front of the court because it would use it for disinformation campaigns against the investigation. Despite the evidence supporting this claim, the case has not been resolved for months. The practice of using U.S. laws to go after the opponents of the Kremlin called 'corporate raiding' seems to be fairly common, allegedly also because U.S. judges 'often lack the resources to distinguish which foreign cases are legitimate and which are politically motivated.' At the same time, Kremlin's official disinformation channels, like Sputnik and RT, often promote distrust to the justice system in the United States, which they portray 'as an arm of the American political elite.'Kremlin Watch Reading Suggestion Weapons of Mass Distraction:Foreign State-Sponsored Disinformation in the Digital Age According to a recentreport[8]by Christina Nemr and William Gangware, a growing number of states, in the pursuit of geopolitical ends, areleveraging digital tools and social media networks to spread disinformation, aiming to shape public perceptions and undermine trust in the truth. As the proliferation of social media has eroded traditional media hierarchies and claims of authority, the environment is ripe for exploitation. It isfavourable to sensationalist contentthat generates clicks, which could potentially range from biased half-truths to conspiracy theories to outright lies. On average, a false story reaches 1,500 people six times quicker than a factual story, amplified by the fact that people often turn to information that only reinforces their worldview. The authors maintain that disinformation succeeds partly because ofpsychological factors, such as the need to belong, the overwhelming effect of the sheer volume of information, and people's propensity towards 'us versus them' tribalism. The report provides anoverview of countries notable for the extent and sophistication of their foreign influence and disinformation campaigns, including Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia. In addition, it examines some of the platform-specific challenges and existing efforts in countering disinformation. Although tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have demonstrated some willingness to address the problem, their incentives are not always prioritized to limit disinformation, particularly in the short-term. Because of the absence of clear delineations of responsibility, a reasonable next step could involvegreater collaboration between technology companies and governments. Kremlin Watchis a strategic program of the European Values Think-Tank, which aims to expose and confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against liberal-democratic system.

European Values director Jakub Janda is quoted:'The President's office is blackmailing the Prime Minister that if he fails to award the CZK 150-200 billion ($6.6-8.8 billion) to the Russians, he will lose Zeman's support, who will then destroy his coalition by using Communists and some Social Democrats.' In aninterview for thePolish-Ukrainian Portal[2], analyst and coordinator of the Kremlin Watch Program Veronika Vchov presents our recentpublication[3]: '2018 Ranking of countermeasures by the EU28 to the Kremlin's subversion operations.' She highlights that'people often fail to understand that propaganda is not just disinformation. </p><p>It is intimately linked to other forms of subversion, including political corruption, abuse of minorities, and espionage. Countries need a comprehensive strategy to combat it, but few use a complex approach.'She also evaluatesthe European Union's approach as inadequate:'In the European Union, there is only one small team focusing on Russian disinformation. Some member states have been calling for an enhancement, but the official bodies of the European Union have not come through. We will see if that changes next year with a new President of the European Commission and a new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.'Topics of the WeekA seniorRussian official lost his race to becomenew Chief of Interpol[4], partly due to public outrage over the Russian Federation's systematic abuse of the institution to serve its own interests. Hackers with alleged links to Russian intelligence services haveimpersonated US State Department officials in order toattack networks across the US[5]public and private sector. Anew publication[6]by Internews Ukraine and Ukraine Worldcalls for EU institutions to 'act, not just study'Russia's information aggression.Good Old Soviet JokeThree convicts discuss why they have been sent to a labour camp: 'I spoke badly about comrade Popov in 1939.' 'I spoke well about comrade Popov in 1943.' 'I am comrade Popov.'Policy ...search News The Kremlin failed to win control over InterpolThe Times of London[7]reported that Alexander Prokopchuk, a senior Russian official, was expected to be elected as the next president of Interpol at the organization's General Assembly meeting this week. The position has been vacant since the arrest of former president Hongew, who was detained under opaque circumstances by the Chinese government. Prokopchuk currently serves as Interpol's vice president and also heads the Russian National Central Bureau, which coordinates work between Interpol and Russia. In this latter role, Prokopchuk directly oversaw, facilitated, and endorsed Russia's abuse of Interpol in order toharass Kremlin critics[8]around the world and attempt toinfluence[9]elections in Estonia. Several European countries, the United States and numerous human rights organizations expressed their worries that Prokopchuk's win wouldindicate[10]that Interpol no longer serves an unbiased platform for international law enforcement but rather as an instrument of power for authoritarian nations. During the Interpolcongress in Dubai today, Alexander Prokopchuk was defeated by the South Korean candidate Kim Jong Yang.Hepatitis C: A source of Russian disinformation in GeorgiaTheBBChas investigated amajor piece of Russian disinformation[11]alleging that the United States conducted illegal human experiments in Georgia with 24 casualties. Theinvestigation concluded[12]that there is no evidence of the US conducting human experiments involving biochemical weapons and that the drugs used by the laboratory in Georgia were clinically approved and widely used to treat Hepatitis C across the world. Igor Giorgadze, former security minister of Georgia and the source behind the false allegations, said in an evasive interview with theBBCthat he has 'no desire whatsoever to prove anything' and that he '[doesn't] know' whether the claims of illegal experimentation were a disinformation campaign or not.France's flip-flop on RT and SputnikDuring Macron's first meeting with Putin, he was hailed forcalling out Sputnik and RT[13]as agents of influence and propaganda whilst standing beside the Russian leader at a joint press conference. This came after RT and Sputnik released an avalanche of fake news online about Macron during the 2017 presidential campaign. However, a year and a half later, the lyse has reversed its position andoffered media accreditation[14]to RT and Sputnik. This decision was weakly justified by an lyse spokesperson on grounds that since they are accredited by the French authority on audio-visual publication, it doesn't make a difference whether they are also accredited by the lyse. This comes a year after France allowed RT tolaunch its own TV channel[15]in France.Why Putin is interested in AIIn a series on the future of artificial intelligence, the Brooking Instituteexamines[16]why the Kremlin is interested in becoming part of the AI race. Putin infamously remarked: 'Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.' In the report, Alina Polyakova identifies three main realms where Russia could use AI in asymmetric warfare: first, to manufacture false audio and video content (so-called deep fakes); second, to gather information without needing to hack personal accounts; and third, to improve the precision and targeting of disinformation. While the Kremlin already creates content tailored to specific audiences, AI could increase such accuracy to the personal level.Has the United States been 'infected'?In an explosive three-partseries[17],The New York Timesassesses the Kremlin's influence over the US presidential election and the history of disinformation. The first part looks at KGB active measures and how they were used to try and change the 'perception of reality' of US citizens, specifically in the case of Operation Infektion, a story concocted by the KGB alleging that the US had invented AIDS. The second part looks at Russia's disinformation apparatus after the fall of the Soviet Union. It follows the rise of Putin and the evolution of the FSB's manipulation campaigns, beginning within Russia before expanding to the international community. The finale is focused on the lessons learnt from around the world in fighting back against disinformation and calls out big tech companies and the US administration for failing to respond adequately. We recommend reading the tripartite series in its entirety.US Developments Future of US primacy facing 'grave' crisisIn a bleak review of the current US defense strategy, a bipartisan commission haswarned[18]that the United States faces 'a grave crisis of national security' and potentially risks 'unacceptably high casualties', possibly including a decisive military defeat in a war with China or Russia. Citing deep atrophies in America's hitherto unchallenged military and technological edge, as well as significant concern over the threat of China's and Russia's authoritarian regimes, thereport[19]finds that America's capacity to defend itself and its allies is 'increasingly in doubt' and faces 'grave and lasting' consequences if prompt remedial action is not taken. Acknowledging Russia's 'invasion and dismemberment' of neighboring states, the review outlines the dangerous prevalence and 'considerable success' of Moscow's 'grey-zone' tactics, leveraging upon surreptitious instruments of proxy, cyber, and information warfare to undermine sovereign nations and weaken NATO and the EU. In containing the aggression of a 'revanchist' Russia, the report recommends that US and NATO allies must work to rebuild a conventional NATO force along the Baltics and Europe's eastern quarters in order to keep pace with Russia's military modernization.Russian hackers found impersonating US officialsAfter a relative lull in activity, hackers allegedly linked to Russian intelligence services have beenfound[20]impersonating US State Department officials in order to infect networks across the US public and private sector. As part of a 'surprise' spear-phishing campaign, hackers sent emails imitating a State Department public affairs specialist, encouraging recipients to download malware-infested documents. The cyber operationreportedly[21]targeted over 20 industries across the private and public sectors, including defense, military, law enforcement and local government. While formal attribution for the attacks is described as ongoing, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrikeasserts[22]that the 'Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and targeting are consistent with previously identified campaigns from the Russia-based actor COZY BEAR'. Cozy Bear, otherwise designated as 'APT29', is one of the Kremlin-linked hacking groups responsible for the 2016 Democratic National Committee hack, linked to either Russia's foreign intelligence service (SVR) or federal security service (FSB).US distances itself from global cyber initiativeThis week, 51 nations and over 150 technology firms lodged theirsupport[23]for an international effort to regulate the internet and 'improve trust, security and stability in cyberspace'. Launched by French President Emmanuel Macron, the 'Paris Call for Trust ...curity in Cyberspace' initiative calls for, among a number of international measures, action to strengthen defenses against malign electoral interference, prevent proliferation of malicious cyber-tools, and mitigate cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property. However, the United States sits amongst the nations that have refused to take part - notably including Russia and China -The Associated Pressreports[24]. Although the global effort is supported by numerous US tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Microsoft,Reuters[25]andThe New York Times[26]write that Washington's critical opposition is reflective of Trump's reluctance to commit the US to programs seen as a bid to encroach upon national sovereignty and, more notably, of US apprehension over relinquishing or limiting its own options for using offensive and defensive cyberweapons in the future.Kremlin Watch Reading Suggestion Taming the Hydra: How to Resist Kremlin's Information Aggression?Internews Ukraine has published a comprehensivereport[27]detailing ways to resist the Kremlin's information aggression. The report compares Russian disinformation to a hydra, a serpentine monster from Greek mythology with multiple heads and the ability to self-regenerate, sprouting two heads for every one that was chopped off. Similarly, Russia information warfare consists of adynamic, multi-faceted network that involves various information sources which are easily replaced if censored or taken down. The report suggests that the international community shouldde-weaponize informationby: 1) Gaining a better understanding of the threats, 2) Increasing the transparency of traditional and social media, including the identification and exposure of agents of information influence, 3) Increasing the transparency of political and information campaigns, 4) Creating a new regulatory framework for combatting disinformation, 5) Coordinating cooperation between public authorities and civil society, 6) Reducing room for malicious agents to manoeuvre, 7) Strengthening democratic narratives, and 8) Developing media literacy. EU institutions are encouraged to 'act, not just study'.The EEAS East StratCom Task Force, arguably the most important government-sponsored attempt to respond to Russia's information subversion, demonstrates thatRussian disinformation is largely overlooked in EU institutions.The Task Force should be expanded to include analytical networks in each EU member state, platforms which publish in all languages of the member states and East Partnership states, and similar units in the domestic branches of the EU. Kremlin Watchis a strategic program of the European Values Think-Tank, which aims to expose and confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against liberal-democratic system.

Good Old Soviet Joke Little Vovochka decided to become president when he grows up. And he did. Policy &amp;#38; Research NewsEuropean Commission reviewed the Code of Practice on Disinformation The European Commissionhas undertaken the recent assessment[1]of the Code of Practice which is aimed at combating disinformation.The initial code wasreleased in October 2018[2]with the purpose to curb the spread of disinformation before the 2019 European Parliament Elections. </p><p>The code promoted the idea of strengthening the collaboration between government, the tech industry, academy, and civil society which remains atodds and not sufficiently coordinated[3].As of now the Code of Practice on Disinformationhas been signed[4]by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, TikTok, and Twitter, along with the trade association representing online platforms (EDIMA). Earlier in June of this year,the Commission pressed the tech giants[5]and called for more action being taken to detect pandemic-related disinformation and ads. June'sreport also added[6]that the Commission should consider the introduction of 'sanctions and redress mechanisms'.One of the paramount highlights of the recent assessment is the need for big tech companies that are signed up for this code to advance their accountability and transparency and boost their proactiveness in thwarting disinformation outbreaks. The EU[7]concluded that although platforms have exerted some efforts to detect malign influence operations, those efforts were not sufficient to expose COVID-related Info Ops.EU lawmakers also stressed thatwithout a legally binding framework, the tech[8]sector will not be capable of overcoming existing hardships.'The time has come togo beyond self-regulatory measures[9]. Europe is best placed to lead the way and propose instruments for more resilient and fair democracy in an increasingly digital world'.According to the assessment tofill the existing loopholes[10],the alterations in the code should be undertaken 'by providing commonly-shared definitions, clearer procedures, more precise and more comprehensive commitments, as well as transparent key performance indicators (KPIs) and appropriate monitoring. Participation should be broadened to include other relevant stakeholders, in particular from the advertising sector'.It is alsoacknowledged that opaque[11]oversight over paid-political ads, namely the political micro-targeting, alongside engagement of users with the exposed disinformation campaigns require further reforming by the tech companies.New amendments to the Digital Service Act are also underway. Those should be adoptedto enhance social media's responsibilities[12]and liability for content on their platforms. Now it is official: Bilateral Russia-China cooperation on disinformation The previous week duringthe joint press conference in Moscow[13],Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yiand Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made a statement that parties reached a broad consensus on strengthening cooperation in multiple areas, including anti-COVID-19 and peacekeeping, and also combating against disinformation.The special attention was given to theinfo-security[14]and cybersecurity. Both parties expressed their concerns over the dissemination of disinformation amidst the pandemic by certain countries, which contributed to the emergence of'the barriers for citizens of countries to learn about each other'[15].Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Director-General hasposted on her Twitter[16]that in response states call 'on all governments and media outlets to strengthen coordination and reject disinformation. No country should interfere in others' internal affairs or level groundless accusations at other countries' political system or development path.'.Prior to this announcement, some small steps have been already taken on this path. For instance, in 2018 China Media Group signeda cooperation agreement[17]with the Russian news agency; Huawei announcedthat will supply technologies[18]to Rossia Segodnya and some other mutual efforts were done in this dimension. However, the recent announcement signalsmore straight-forwardpolitical development between the parties. US DevelopmentsThe Trump team welcomed Russian disinformation, the Trump administration further confirms The US Treasury Department has announcednew sanctions against Andrii Derkach[19], a Ukrainian lawmaker accused of interfering in the U.S.'s 2020 election on behalf of Russia. Derkach has close ties to President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and was identified by the US intelligence community as helping Moscow's ongoing efforts to weaken the Democratic campaign againstTrump several months ago. Guliani told CNN that'I never put any of his information in my report to State, and met (Derkach) long after my investigation was over.' Several incidents over recent months have connected President Trump, his administration, and his campaign toRussian disinformation efforts[20], including a retweet of edited audio of Vice President Joe Biden's and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's purported phone call. Kremlin's Current NarrativeA Friend is Known in Trouble: Meeting of Putin and Lukashenko On September 14, Putin met with Lukashenko to discuss'the key questions of strategic partnership'[21]of Russia and Belarus. According to the Press Secretary for the Russian presidentDmitry Peskov[22], among the main topics were economy, defence and fight against coronavirus.One of the most prominent outcomes is arguably the promise to provide Minsk with a loan of$ 1.5 billion[23]. Peskovstated[24], however, that it cannot be considered an intervention into domestic affairs of Belarus, but rather an act of help for the economy of the brotherly country and a major ally of Russia. In addition to this, Putinpointed out[25]that Russia still remains one of the most significant investors in Belarus, with around 50% of the foreign trade turnover 'falling on' Russia.Even though Kremlin underlined that the loan would be provided to Belarus, andnot to the president Lukashenko[26], Putin confirmed thatRussia recognizes[27]Lukashenko as a legitimate president of Belarus and as Putin's'vis-a-vis'[28]in the interstate relations. The Russian president also supports Lukashenko's plans forconstitutional reform[29], adding that 'neither Moscow nor other European capitals' should get involved in the resolution of the situation in Belarus.During the meeting, Putin has alsoconfirmed[30]that Belarus will be the first country to receive the Russian coronavirus vaccine and has already joined the last stage of the trial.Finally, as a result of the summit, the Russian military reserves for Belarus are leaving their position on the border of the country, since the 'extreme measures' to suppress the protesterswere not needed[31]. However, both leadersagreed[32]to further cooperate in the sphere of defence, as the joint Russian/Belorussian military training'Slavic Brotherhood - 2020'[33]begins.In general, Moscow will adhere to the previously established agreements, even from the times'before Putin'[34], such as the established principles of the Union State andCollective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)[35]. Thus, relations between the two states are to remain practicallythe same[36].Lukashenko thanked the Russian president for the support in this post-election period and stated that Belarus should'stick closer to the older brother'[37]in such complicated times. Headded[38]that the protests in Belarus are a lesson that both Minsk and Moscow successfully 'endured'.Kremlin Watchis a strategic program of the European Values Center for Security Policy, which aims to expose and confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against the liberal-democratic system. \u0421\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 Kremlin Watch Briefing: The Trump team welcomed Russian disinformation[39] \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 StopFake[40].

If we want to talk about the big tech companies, we should not forget aboutYouTube. Kremlin rejects the Mueller report, while evidence indicatedRussian oligarchs attempted to meet Trump. </p><p>NATO StratCom COE presents30 geopolitical scenarios with a focus on strategic communicationsin its new study.Good Old Soviet JokeA lecturer from the District Party committee says to the workers, 'The imperialists meddle in the internal affairs of the USSR all over the globe.'Policy ...search News Notre Dame burns as disinformation machine engagesAfter surviving two World Wars, the French Revolution and many more political upheavals, the 21stcentury saw the destruction of parts of the approx. 900-year-old structure. But, as the embers were still burning,the Kremlin's disinformation channels began blaming the Yellow Vests, Muslims, and exploiting the tragedy to further divide Western culture[3]. The speed of the reaction and its global reach is noteworthy. In other bizarre arguments, France was now suffering because it had supported hard-line Nazis in Ukraine, bringing the then-candidate Volodymyr Zelensky. Though this attempt may have failed even on RT channels, failure is, as we know, part and parcel of the Russian strategy. No matter how absurd, while this attempt may have fallen flat, the seeds of dishonesty and absurdity are sown.Let's not forget about YouTubeA piece onThe Verge[4]discussed a recentNew York Times profile[5]of the YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. In particular, it points out that, while she is sheltered from some of the pressures facing Facebook and Twitter due to corporate structure, she also runs a platform uniquely suited to amplify disinformation, in a way that Facebook is not. According to The Verge, the two simply have different usages - Fakebook's primary function of facilitating connections means it is better positioned to filter out unwanted or polarising content. Meanwhile, as an entertainment site, YouTube naturally tilts towards the sort of content that will generate more attention and thus, more ad revenue. More specifically, it relies heavily on the so-called 'borderline content' - videos coming close to violating YouTube's content regulations without crossing that thin line. This is a problem that's built into the platform, as 'borderline content' creates the most engagement on the site. It is clear both YouTube generally and Susan Wojcicki specifically faces a serious problem, and the pressure is mounting for it to adjust its algorithms in order to reduce exposure and distribution of false or otherwise 'borderline' content. However, it remains to be seen whether the company will make good on its promises to improve, and how it will do it without jeopardising its business in the process.Ukrainian election as a testing groundAfter Ukraine published an expansive White Book this winter, its exemplary place as a testing ground for Russian hybrid and disinformation campaigns has held its ground. As it is a testing ground for the Kremlin, its defensive tactics can prove as progressive as the attacks themselves.The Atlantic sat down with Dmytro Zolotukhin, the man in charge of Ukraine's information policy[6]. The Ministry of Information Policy was only founded in 2016 but continues to be woefully underfunded. Though Ukraine has taken hard-line tactics to ban Russian social-media alternatives and even search engines, this has of course simply called for more ingenious attacks. Kyiv is becoming the vanguard site for the global problem governments face: do they restrict free speech in the face of foreign threats, and consider the restrictions they place on the rights that come with a free democracy? Ukraine is looking to ban outlets that spread disinformation only during elections times, and education programs have also help promising results.'The Europeans' discuss national differences in misinformationOn this week's'The Europeans' podcast[7], the hostKaty Lee[8](Agence France - Presse) talks with Jules Darmanin, who leads a new cross-border initiative of journalist fact-checkers calledFactCheckEU[9]. The organization translates debunks among European languages, as well as fosters cross-border investigative projects and answers general questions about European policies and the news. Darmanin explains the rationale for creating an international fact-check organization, which is that disinformation has no borders. A famous example is a Greek TV presenter stating that refugees in Germany had been receiving 'brothel vouchers' - a rumour which originated in Austria and Germany. In general, disinformation about migrants and refugees is among the most mobile due to its global and polarising nature. According to him, it is hard to say whether some countries are more susceptible to misinformation than others. However, in some cases it appears to spread and take root easier. Greece is one such case, where after a prolonged economic crisis legacy news outlet are understaffed and that vacuum has allowed for more provocative media outlets to foster. In other cases, such as in the so-called 'news deserts' without local news outlets in the US, which allows lower quality outlets to monopolize the information space.US Developments Kremlin's response to the Mueller reportWhile the Mueller Report established there was not a collision between Trump and the Kremlin during the 2016 election cycle, a redacted version of the report released last Thursday includes detailed information about the efforts by the Russian intelligence services to hack servers at the Democratic National Committee, certain Russian businessman attempting to forge ties with Trump, and a disinformation campaign waged by the Internet Research Agency to influence American voters in 2016. However,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov[10]said that the report 'still does not present any conclusive evidence of alleged interference by the Russian Federation in the electoral process in America and we continue to refuse to accept any such accusation.' Three Russian businessmen: Petr Aven, Kirill Dmitriev, and Sergey Gorkov, who all have close ties to Vladimir Putin, attempted to reach out to Trump or his administration in 2016[11]. The Mueller report revealed that Petr Aven attempted to reach out to the Presidential Transition Team in connection to anticipated post-election sanctions. Aven told investigators that he met regularly with Putin in 2016, and he said that Putin's suggestions during these meetings wereunderstood to be 'directives'[12], which entailed consequences for not following through. Kiril Dmitriev who also attempted to make contact with the Trump transition team is noteworthy for drafting a plan for U.S. Russia reconciliation with Rick Gerson a close friend of Jared Kushner and calling Putin his 'boss'. Sergey Gorkov, who served as a senior manager for Sberbank,met with Jared Kushner[13]on December 13, 2016. The Mueller report detailed that Gorkov gave Kushner a painting and a bag of soil from the town in Belarus that his family originally hailed from, however, the report did not establish any conclusions on the nature of the meeting. While Gorkov said the meeting was strictly business related, the fact he brought Kushner gifts makes it questionable.China and Russia seek influence in Latin AmericaOver recent months the U.S. has beenstruggling to develop ways to prevent[14]China and Russia from furthering their influence in Latin America, and this is occurring amidst Latin American governments seeking to distance themselves from the Trump administration. In the past, U.S. defence officials have sought non-force option such as humanitarian missions and more training for Latin American armed forces todeter China and Russia in Venezuela[15]and Latin America as a whole, however, Trump recent bids to curb Latin American migration and drug trafficking to the U.S., have come at a cost. Due to the rush of migrants at the U.S. border, the Trump administration has plans toslash aid[16]for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala because the administration does not view the aid as being effective. Trump has alsoplaced sanctions[17]on Cuba and Nicaragua for their support of the Maduro government in Venezuela andrecalled diplomats[18]after Central American nations stopped recognizing Taiwan. This is leading Latin American officials to reassess the worth of U.S. relationships andBenjamin Gedan[19]a former National Security Council official said this is 'Entirely Counterproductive..The Trump administration's policies have supercharged China's increased presence in the region.' Both China and Russia have invested billions in Venezuela, and Russian has not shown hesitation to antagonize the U.S. in the nation and demonstrate its might. While China has been increasing its presence heavily in the region and is attempting to replace American influence in disgruntled countries, Russia's presence has been mainly confined to Venezuela.R. Evan Ellis[20]a research professor at the U.S. Army War College has said that Russian proliferation of arms and military hardware has declined as nations look to China for more reliable systems. Russia's strategy in the region also seems to point more towards provocation than strategy\u2014unlike China. Ellis described the Russian presence as showing more weakness than strength and not having any long term sustainability.Kremlin Watch Reading Suggestion Hybrid Threats: A Strategic Communications PerspectiveThis week, we recommend a newstudy[21]by the NATO StratCom COE, which is designed to help national authorities buildresilience to hybrid threatsand effectively respond to them. It presents30 detailed case studieswith a broad variety of geopolitical scenarios (from Russian snap exercises in the High North to Pakistani involvement in Yemen) and focuses on Strategic Communications. Defining hybrid threats as a 'type of threat that combines conventional, irregular and asymmetric activities in time and space', it emphasises that their key aspect is ambiguity - that is, the responsible actors and overall intent are often unclear. Therefore, understanding the hybrid threat environment requires an appreciation of the interplay between information, perception, interpretation, and decision-making.Strategic Communicationswith its holistic approach based on values and interests should be endorsed as a guiding principle across all levels of government with a recognition that communication is not limited to words but can encompass any action or inaction. Furthermore, it is necessary to evaluate the underlying thinking and aims behind adversarial actions as well as to identify a country's own existing vulnerabilities (such as domestic issues), which malign actors may seek to exploit. Although not every action is a threat, it is important for government departments to be proactive and have an understanding of the information environment. Meanwhile,setting clear objectives consistent with core values, in addition to coherent and factual government communications will help preserve credibility. Kremlin Watchis a strategic program of the European Values Think-Tank, which aims to expose and confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against liberal-democratic system.

We've got a lot of trepidations going into midterm elections. And to that, we've had a lot of other unresolved issues, from Brexit to the Italian fiscal situation. We've added some risks in there in terms of Angela Merkel's resignation.  </p><p>      There's a lot going on. And of course a pervasive weight on market is concerns about trade and as well as Fed tightening and neither both have gone away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Are there any opportunities here that when you look down at all this like sort of wall of worry that you're describing, all these chaos, are there areas that the market that are standing out is like, OK, this is getting a little much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Absolutely. And the sell-off in tech has been overdone. There's a lot of concern, whispers that if we see a Democratic House there could be greater regulation on tech. And I think that's fueling some of the concerns around tech.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  And the U.K. budget today that they're going to be taxing some of the big tech companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Absolutely. And so that has weighed down on tech but that's where we can get some pretty significant secular growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  I just think it's worth pointing out, we're not even down that much anymore. We've had a pretty nice bounce, S&amp;P down 0.6%, Dow 1%. Still deeply red but clearly off the worst levels from literally just when I got on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Well, and that's my question, Mike, to you. Are we just seeing Argos going wild?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDE</emphasis>:  And, Kristina, you were just saying that you weren't expecting this bouncing off these days anytime, but we do have a divided market voice here at the moment. We have Goldman Sachs saying, hey, stop buying. The valuations got too eroded here. And then we have Morgan Stanley saying, you know, sell every rally. Where do you sit on the spectrum?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  I sit in a very neutral place and that I have a long-term time horizon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDE</emphasis>:  In Switzerland.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  I think you could say. I have a very long-term time horizon and we encourage our investors to have very long time horizons. And in that environment, certainly, there are opportunities to be tactical and pick up some bargains but certainly there's no place for a wholesale removal from this market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  We thought we're going to be talking about the big story of the day which was IBM buying Red Hat. And the sympathy trade with a bunch of tech, all those sort of arrays, but what do you make of like big juicy M&amp;A deals like that people say about the whole space?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDE</emphasis>:  Let's get back to Kristina Hooper of Invesco and Bloomberg's Mike Regan.  </p><p>      Kristina, I want to get your sense and perspective on what it means for China for you at the moment because this is what sent off lower was the concern that tariffs could be ramping up once again?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  And I think that's absolutely what we still be concerned about. In fact, I would take the news this morning that China was cutting auto taxes is actually a negative 2. Because that's one more stimulative act that they've done from cutting rates to devaluating the yuan to essentially supported economy. That tells me they're hunkering down and getting ready for a full-blown trade war, including the talks they've just had with Japan. This is not intended to be -- they don't expect to capitulate from everything I'm seeing. And so I would expect the trade talk to be unsuccessful next month and for us to go into more full blown trade wars.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Speaking of capitulation when do we start seeing the market or the Fed or the market's perception of the Fed come down with respect to the pace of rate hikes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Well, we need to hear some messaging from the Fed because keep in mind, last week, we continued to hear full speed ahead. Although the Loretta Mester did give us a bit of an out and said, well, essentially we're still data dependent so we could change course.  </p><p>      So I think we need to listen to messaging from the Fed and also of course follow the economic data. For example the jobs report this week. If we have an easing in wage growth it remains very modest, then that gives the Fed a bit more flexibility to take its foot off the accelerator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  You know, I have to wonder too, Joe's point though, about interest rates. Interestingly, on this risk off day, yet again, we see 10-year yields and the two-year yields and the day slighter higher which indicates that we are not going to the haven type of asset class and should be somewhat unnerving. And I have to wonder, you know, Caroline, you point to the trade tensions, but how much of this really underneath is a rate-hiking story. And I wonder what you're hearing, Mike, from your sources.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Hold on one second. Kristina, do you buy this? Do you buy that this is just like rebalancing issue or do you think this is real sort of higher rates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  I do think this is a higher rate issue. Although it is combined with a trade issue because trade is finally getting tangible. So really it's in Switzerland.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDE</emphasis>:  Oh, Kristina, what about the dollar? How much of this is a concerned about the dollar story we're hearing in earnings now, how much and what's falling on the back that we worried about dollar strength?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Well, the dollar is so interrelated with the Fed story, right? Because the closest correlation with the dollar going higher is expectations about Fed's fund rate. So it's all interconnected. And certainly trade has played a role in boosting the dollar as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  OK. So what's going to turn the market around? What is the market looking for? Earnings, it doesn't really seem to be doing it. Do you think the trade war is going it get worse? It doesn't look like the Fed is going to capitulate any time soon. So what is the market need to see?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Well, the market needs to see some Fed action and other central bank action that suggest they're starting to at least take their foot off the accelerator. It's not just the Fed we have to worry about. It's also the ECB.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Keep in mind, we've got a lot of too political risk and they suggest that they're going to continue to go forward with the plan to end tapering at the end of this year. I would expect that at some point if the situation worsens that these two major central banks do try to get a little bit more dovish.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Other big story obviously the election coming up in a week from tomorrow. How much is that sort of dominating what people are interested in as far as your interaction with people on the terminal and stuff like that?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Kristina, real quick, are you advising that your clients hold a little bit more cash if they can?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Well, if they have dry powder this maybe a good time to actually deploy it. But what we are advising is actually to be incredibly well diversified. So have exposure outside the U.S. and broadly outside the U.S., also have adequate exposure to alternatives because historically, they've had a lower correlation to equities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Like?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOOPER</emphasis>:  Like for example gold, real estate and market mutual funds.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Kristina Hooper, thank you so much. Really interesting insight. Thank you so much.

And so that has weighed down on tech but that's where  we can get some pretty significant secular growth.</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  I just think it's worth pointing out, we're not even down that  much anymore.  We've had a pretty nice bounce, S&amp;P down 0.6%, Dow 1%.   Still deeply red but clearly off the worst levels from literally just when  I got on.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Well, and that's my question, Mike, to you.  Are we just  seeing Argos going wild?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CAROLINE HYDE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  And, Kristina, you were just saying that  you weren't expecting this bouncing off these days anytime, but we do have  a divided market voice here at the moment.  We have Goldman Sachs saying,  hey, stop buying.  The valuations got too eroded here.  And then we have  Morgan Stanley saying, you know, sell every rally.  Where do you sit on the  spectrum?</p><p>HOOPER:  I sit in a very neutral place and that I have a long-term time  horizon.</p><p>HYDE:  In Switzerland.</p><p>HOOPER:  I think you could say.  I have a very long-term time horizon and  we encourage our investors to have very long time horizons.  And in that  environment, certainly, there are opportunities to be tactical and pick up  some bargains but certainly there's no place for a wholesale removal from  this market.</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  We thought we're going to be talking about the big story of  the day which was IBM buying Red Hat.  And the sympathy trade with a bunch  of tech, all those sort of arrays, but what do you make of like big juicy  M&amp;A deals like that people say about the whole space?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>HYDE:  Let's get back to Kristina Hooper of Invesco and Bloomberg's Mike  Regan.</p><p>Kristina, I want to get your sense and perspective on what it means for  China for you at the moment because this is what sent off lower was the  concern that tariffs could be ramping up once again?</p><p>HOOPER:  And I think that's absolutely what we still be concerned about.   In fact, I would take the news this morning that China was cutting auto  taxes is actually a negative 2.  Because that's one more stimulative act  that they've done from cutting rates to devaluating the yuan to essentially  supported economy.  That tells me they're hunkering down and getting ready  for a full-blown trade war, including the talks they've just had with  Japan.  This is not intended to be -- they don't expect to capitulate from  everything I'm seeing.  And so I would expect the trade talk to be  unsuccessful next month and for us to go into more full blown trade wars.</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  Speaking of capitulation when do we start seeing the market or  the Fed or the market's perception of the Fed come down with respect to the  pace of rate hikes?</p><p>HOOPER:  Well, we need to hear some messaging from the Fed because keep in  mind, last week, we continued to hear full speed ahead.  Although the  Loretta Mester did give us a bit of an out and said, well, essentially  we're still data dependent so we could change course.</p><p>So I think we need to listen to messaging from the Fed and also of course  follow the economic data.

Interestingly, on this risk off day, yet again, we see 10- year yields and the two-year yields and the day slighter higher which  indicates that we are not going to the haven type of asset class and should  be somewhat unnerving.  And I have to wonder, you know, Caroline, you point  to the trade tensions, but how much of this really underneath is a rate- hiking story.  And I wonder what you're hearing, Mike, from your sources.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Hold on one second.  Kristina, do you buy this?  Do you buy  that this is just like rebalancing issue or do you think this is real sort  of higher rates.</p><p>HOOPER:  I do think this is a higher rate issue.  Although it is combined  with a trade issue because trade is finally getting tangible.  So really  it's in Switzerland.</p><p>HYDE:  Oh, Kristina, what about the dollar?  How much of this is a  concerned about the dollar story we're hearing in earnings now, how much  and what's falling on the back that we worried about dollar strength?</p><p>HOOPER:  Well, the dollar is so interrelated with the Fed story, right?   Because the closest correlation with the dollar going higher is  expectations about Fed's fund rate.  So it's all interconnected.  And  certainly trade has played a role in boosting the dollar as well.</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  OK.  So what's going to turn the market around?  What is the  market looking for?  Earnings, it doesn't really seem to be doing it.  Do  you think the trade war is going it get worse?  It doesn't look like the  Fed is going to capitulate any time soon.  So what is the market need to  see?</p><p>HOOPER:  Well, the market needs to see some Fed action and other central  bank action that suggest they're starting to at least take their foot off  the accelerator.

But what we are advising is actually to be incredibly well  diversified.  So have exposure outside the U.S. and broadly outside the  U.S., also have adequate exposure to alternatives because historically,  they've had a lower correlation to equities.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Like?</p><p>HOOPER:  Like for example gold, real estate and market mutual funds.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Kristina Hooper, thank you so much.

We've got a lot of  trepidations going into midterm elections.  And to that, we've had a lot of  other unresolved issues, from Brexit to the Italian fiscal situation.   We've added some risks in there in terms of Angela Merkel's resignation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There's a lot going on.  And of course a pervasive weight on market is  concerns about trade and as well as Fed tightening and neither both have  gone away.</p><p> JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Are there any opportunities here that  when you look down at all this like sort of wall of worry that you're  describing, all these chaos, are there areas that the market that are  standing out is like, OK, this is getting a little much.</p><p> HOOPER:  Absolutely.  And the sell-off in tech has been overdone.  There's  a lot of concern, whispers that if we see a Democratic House there could be  greater regulation on tech.

And so that has weighed down on tech but that's where  we can get some pretty significant secular growth.</p><p> WEISENTHAL:  I just think it's worth pointing out, we're not even down that  much anymore.  We've had a pretty nice bounce, S&amp;P down 0.6%, Dow 1%.   Still deeply red but clearly off the worst levels from literally just when  I got on.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Well, and that's my question, Mike, to you.  Are we just  seeing Argos going wild?</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CAROLINE HYDE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  And, Kristina, you were just saying that  you weren't expecting this bouncing off these days anytime, but we do have  a divided market voice here at the moment.  We have Goldman Sachs saying,  hey, stop buying.  The valuations got too eroded here.  And then we have  Morgan Stanley saying, you know, sell every rally.  Where do you sit on the  spectrum?</p><p> HOOPER:  I sit in a very neutral place and that I have a long-term time  horizon.</p><p> HYDE:  In Switzerland.</p><p> HOOPER:  I think you could say.  I have a very long-term time horizon and  we encourage our investors to have very long time horizons.  And in that  environment, certainly, there are opportunities to be tactical and pick up  some bargains but certainly there's no place for a wholesale removal from  this market.</p><p> WEISENTHAL:  We thought we're going to be talking about the big story of  the day which was IBM buying Red Hat.  And the sympathy trade with a bunch  of tech, all those sort of arrays, but what do you make of like big juicy  M&amp;A deals like that people say about the whole space?</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> HYDE:  Let's get back to Kristina Hooper of Invesco and Bloomberg's Mike  Regan.</p><p> Kristina, I want to get your sense and perspective on what it means for  China for you at the moment because this is what sent off lower was the  concern that tariffs could be ramping up once again?</p><p> HOOPER:  And I think that's absolutely what we still be concerned about.   In fact, I would take the news this morning that China was cutting auto  taxes is actually a negative 2.  Because that's one more stimulative act  that they've done from cutting rates to devaluating the yuan to essentially  supported economy.  That tells me they're hunkering down and getting ready  for a full-blown trade war, including the talks they've just had with  Japan.  This is not intended to be -- they don't expect to capitulate from  everything I'm seeing.  And so I would expect the trade talk to be  unsuccessful next month and for us to go into more full blown trade wars.</p><p> WEISENTHAL:  Speaking of capitulation when do we start seeing the market or  the Fed or the market's perception of the Fed come down with respect to the  pace of rate hikes?</p><p> HOOPER:  Well, we need to hear some messaging from the Fed because keep in  mind, last week, we continued to hear full speed ahead.  Although the  Loretta Mester did give us a bit of an out and said, well, essentially  we're still data dependent so we could change course.</p><p> So I think we need to listen to messaging from the Fed and also of course  follow the economic data.  For example the jobs report this week.  If we  have an easing in wage growth it remains very modest, then that gives the  Fed a bit more flexibility to take its foot off the accelerator.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  You know, I have to wonder too, Joe's point though, about  interest rates.  Interestingly, on this risk off day, yet again, we see 10- year yields and the two-year yields and the day slighter higher which  indicates that we are not going to the haven type of asset class and should  be somewhat unnerving.

Although it is combined  with a trade issue because trade is finally getting tangible.  So really  it's in Switzerland.</p><p> HYDE:  Oh, Kristina, what about the dollar?  How much of this is a  concerned about the dollar story we're hearing in earnings now, how much  and what's falling on the back that we worried about dollar strength?</p><p> HOOPER:  Well, the dollar is so interrelated with the Fed story, right?   Because the closest correlation with the dollar going higher is  expectations about Fed's fund rate.  So it's all interconnected.  And  certainly trade has played a role in boosting the dollar as well.</p><p> WEISENTHAL:  OK.  So what's going to turn the market around?  What is the  market looking for?  Earnings, it doesn't really seem to be doing it.  Do  you think the trade war is going it get worse?  It doesn't look like the  Fed is going to capitulate any time soon.  So what is the market need to  see?</p><p> HOOPER:  Well, the market needs to see some Fed action and other central  bank action that suggest they're starting to at least take their foot off  the accelerator.  It's not just the Fed we have to worry about.  It's also  the ECB.</p><p> WEISENTHAL:  Right.</p><p> HOOPER:  Keep in mind, we've got a lot of too political risk and they  suggest that they're going to continue to go forward with the plan to end  tapering at the end of this year.  I would expect that at some point if the  situation worsens that these two major central banks do try to get a little  bit more dovish.</p><p> WEISENTHAL:  Other big story obviously the election coming up in a week  from tomorrow.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Let's bring in Kristina Hooper, Invesco Global Chief Market Strategist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kristina, what you make of today's sell-off and does it give you a sense that we're not done here with the pain?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KRISTINA HOOPER, CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO: I haven't expected this to be done and this just confirms that. We've got a lot of trepidations going into midterm elections. And to that, we've had a lot of other unresolved issues, from Brexit to the Italian fiscal situation. We've added some risks in there in terms of Angela Merkel's resignation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's a lot going on. And of course a pervasive weight on market is concerns about trade and as well as Fed tightening and neither both have gone away.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Are there any opportunities here that when you look down at all this like sort of wall of worry that you're describing, all these chaos, are there areas that the market that are standing out is like, OK, this is getting a little much.</p><p>HOOPER: Absolutely. And the sell-off in tech has been overdone. There's a lot of concern, whispers that if we see a Democratic House there could be greater regulation on tech. And I think that's fueling some of the concerns around tech.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: And the U.K. budget today that they're going to be taxing some of the big tech companies.</p><p>HOOPER: Absolutely. And so that has weighed down on tech but that's where we can get some pretty significant secular growth.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: I just think it's worth pointing out, we're not even down that much anymore. We've had a pretty nice bounce, S&amp;P down 0.6%, Dow 1%. Still deeply red but clearly off the worst levels from literally just when I got on.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Well, and that's my question, Mike, to you. Are we just seeing Argos going wild?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CAROLINE HYDE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And, Kristina, you were just saying that you weren't expecting this bouncing off these days anytime, but we do have a divided market voice here at the moment. We have Goldman Sachs saying, hey, stop buying. The valuations got too eroded here. And then we have Morgan Stanley saying, you know, sell every rally. Where do you sit on the spectrum?</p><p>HOOPER: I sit in a very neutral place and that I have a long-term time horizon.</p><p>HYDE: In Switzerland.</p><p>HOOPER: I think you could say. I have a very long-term time horizon and we encourage our investors to have very long time horizons. And in that environment, certainly, there are opportunities to be tactical and pick up some bargains but certainly there's no place for a wholesale removal from this market.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: We thought we're going to be talking about the big story of the day which was IBM buying Red Hat. And the sympathy trade with a bunch of tech, all those sort of arrays, but what do you make of like big juicy M&amp;A deals like that people say about the whole space?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>HYDE: Let's get back to Kristina Hooper of Invesco and Bloomberg's Mike Regan.</p><p>Kristina, I want to get your sense and perspective on what it means for China for you at the moment because this is what sent off lower was the concern that tariffs could be ramping up once again?</p><p>HOOPER: And I think that's absolutely what we still be concerned about. In fact, I would take the news this morning that China was cutting auto taxes is actually a negative 2. Because that's one more stimulative act that they've done from cutting rates to devaluating the yuan to essentially supported economy. That tells me they're hunkering down and getting ready for a full-blown trade war, including the talks they've just had with Japan. This is not intended to be -- they don't expect to capitulate from everything I'm seeing. And so I would expect the trade talk to be unsuccessful next month and for us to go into more full blown trade wars.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Speaking of capitulation when do we start seeing the market or the Fed or the market's perception of the Fed come down with respect to the pace of rate hikes?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, we need to hear some messaging from the Fed because keep in mind, last week, we continued to hear full speed ahead. Although the Loretta Mester did give us a bit of an out and said, well, essentially we're still data dependent so we could change course.</p><p>So I think we need to listen to messaging from the Fed and also of course follow the economic data. For example the jobs report this week. If we have an easing in wage growth it remains very modest, then that gives the Fed a bit more flexibility to take its foot off the accelerator.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: You know, I have to wonder too, Joe's point though, about interest rates. Interestingly, on this risk off day, yet again, we see 10- year yields and the two-year yields and the day slighter higher which indicates that we are not going to the haven type of asset class and should be somewhat unnerving. And I have to wonder, you know, Caroline, you point to the trade tensions, but how much of this really underneath is a rate- hiking story. And I wonder what you're hearing, Mike, from your sources.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Hold on one second. Kristina, do you buy this? Do you buy that this is just like rebalancing issue or do you think this is real sort of higher rates.</p><p>HOOPER: I do think this is a higher rate issue. Although it is combined with a trade issue because trade is finally getting tangible. So really it's in Switzerland.</p><p>HYDE: Oh, Kristina, what about the dollar? How much of this is a concerned about the dollar story we're hearing in earnings now, how much and what's falling on the back that we worried about dollar strength?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, the dollar is so interrelated with the Fed story, right? Because the closest correlation with the dollar going higher is expectations about Fed's fund rate. So it's all interconnected. And certainly trade has played a role in boosting the dollar as well.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: OK. So what's going to turn the market around? What is the market looking for? Earnings, it doesn't really seem to be doing it. Do you think the trade war is going it get worse? It doesn't look like the Fed is going to capitulate any time soon. So what is the market need to see?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, the market needs to see some Fed action and other central bank action that suggest they're starting to at least take their foot off the accelerator. It's not just the Fed we have to worry about. It's also the ECB.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>HOOPER: Keep in mind, we've got a lot of too political risk and they suggest that they're going to continue to go forward with the plan to end tapering at the end of this year. I would expect that at some point if the situation worsens that these two major central banks do try to get a little bit more dovish.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Other big story obviously the election coming up in a week from tomorrow. How much is that sort of dominating what people are interested in as far as your interaction with people on the terminal and stuff like that?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Kristina, real quick, are you advising that your clients hold a little bit more cash if they can?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, if they have dry powder this maybe a good time to actually deploy it. But what we are advising is actually to be incredibly well diversified. So have exposure outside the U.S. and broadly outside the U.S., also have adequate exposure to alternatives because historically, they've had a lower correlation to equities.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Like?</p><p>HOOPER: Like for example gold, real estate and market mutual funds.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Kristina Hooper, thank you so much. Really interesting insight. Thank you so much.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Let's bring in Kristina Hooper, Invesco Global Chief Market Strategist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kristina, what you make of today's sell-off and does it give you a sense that we're not done here with the pain?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KRISTINA HOOPER, CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO: I haven't expected this to be done and this just confirms that. We've got a lot of trepidations going into midterm elections. And to that, we've had a lot of other unresolved issues, from Brexit to the Italian fiscal situation. We've added some risks in there in terms of Angela Merkel's resignation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's a lot going on. And of course a pervasive weight on market is concerns about trade and as well as Fed tightening and neither both have gone away.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Are there any opportunities here that when you look down at all this like sort of wall of worry that you're describing, all these chaos, are there areas that the market that are standing out is like, OK, this is getting a little much.</p><p>HOOPER: Absolutely. And the sell-off in tech has been overdone. There's a lot of concern, whispers that if we see a Democratic House there could be greater regulation on tech. And I think that's fueling some of the concerns around tech.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: And the U.K. budget today that they're going to be taxing some of the big tech companies.</p><p>HOOPER: Absolutely. And so that has weighed down on tech but that's where we can get some pretty significant secular growth.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: I just think it's worth pointing out, we're not even down that much anymore. We've had a pretty nice bounce, S&amp;P down 0.6%, Dow 1%. Still deeply red but clearly off the worst levels from literally just when I got on.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Well, and that's my question, Mike, to you. Are we just seeing Argos going wild?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CAROLINE HYDE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And, Kristina, you were just saying that you weren't expecting this bouncing off these days anytime, but we do have a divided market voice here at the moment. We have Goldman Sachs saying, hey, stop buying. The valuations got too eroded here. And then we have Morgan Stanley saying, you know, sell every rally. Where do you sit on the spectrum?</p><p>HOOPER: I sit in a very neutral place and that I have a long-term time horizon.</p><p>HYDE: In Switzerland.</p><p>HOOPER: I think you could say. I have a very long-term time horizon and we encourage our investors to have very long time horizons. And in that environment, certainly, there are opportunities to be tactical and pick up some bargains but certainly there's no place for a wholesale removal from this market.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: We thought we're going to be talking about the big story of the day which was IBM buying Red Hat. And the sympathy trade with a bunch of tech, all those sort of arrays, but what do you make of like big juicy M&amp;A deals like that people say about the whole space?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>HYDE: Let's get back to Kristina Hooper of Invesco and Bloomberg's Mike Regan.</p><p>Kristina, I want to get your sense and perspective on what it means for China for you at the moment because this is what sent off lower was the concern that tariffs could be ramping up once again?</p><p>HOOPER: And I think that's absolutely what we still be concerned about. In fact, I would take the news this morning that China was cutting auto taxes is actually a negative 2. Because that's one more stimulative act that they've done from cutting rates to devaluating the yuan to essentially supported economy. That tells me they're hunkering down and getting ready for a full-blown trade war, including the talks they've just had with Japan. This is not intended to be -- they don't expect to capitulate from everything I'm seeing. And so I would expect the trade talk to be unsuccessful next month and for us to go into more full blown trade wars.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Speaking of capitulation when do we start seeing the market or the Fed or the market's perception of the Fed come down with respect to the pace of rate hikes?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, we need to hear some messaging from the Fed because keep in mind, last week, we continued to hear full speed ahead. Although the Loretta Mester did give us a bit of an out and said, well, essentially we're still data dependent so we could change course.</p><p>So I think we need to listen to messaging from the Fed and also of course follow the economic data. For example the jobs report this week. If we have an easing in wage growth it remains very modest, then that gives the Fed a bit more flexibility to take its foot off the accelerator.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: You know, I have to wonder too, Joe's point though, about interest rates. Interestingly, on this risk off day, yet again, we see 10- year yields and the two-year yields and the day slighter higher which indicates that we are not going to the haven type of asset class and should be somewhat unnerving. And I have to wonder, you know, Caroline, you point to the trade tensions, but how much of this really underneath is a rate- hiking story. And I wonder what you're hearing, Mike, from your sources.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Hold on one second. Kristina, do you buy this? Do you buy that this is just like rebalancing issue or do you think this is real sort of higher rates.</p><p>HOOPER: I do think this is a higher rate issue. Although it is combined with a trade issue because trade is finally getting tangible. So really it's in Switzerland.</p><p>HYDE: Oh, Kristina, what about the dollar? How much of this is a concerned about the dollar story we're hearing in earnings now, how much and what's falling on the back that we worried about dollar strength?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, the dollar is so interrelated with the Fed story, right? Because the closest correlation with the dollar going higher is expectations about Fed's fund rate. So it's all interconnected. And certainly trade has played a role in boosting the dollar as well.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: OK. So what's going to turn the market around? What is the market looking for? Earnings, it doesn't really seem to be doing it. Do you think the trade war is going it get worse? It doesn't look like the Fed is going to capitulate any time soon. So what is the market need to see?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, the market needs to see some Fed action and other central bank action that suggest they're starting to at least take their foot off the accelerator. It's not just the Fed we have to worry about. It's also the ECB.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>HOOPER: Keep in mind, we've got a lot of too political risk and they suggest that they're going to continue to go forward with the plan to end tapering at the end of this year. I would expect that at some point if the situation worsens that these two major central banks do try to get a little bit more dovish.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Other big story obviously the election coming up in a week from tomorrow. How much is that sort of dominating what people are interested in as far as your interaction with people on the terminal and stuff like that?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Kristina, real quick, are you advising that your clients hold a little bit more cash if they can?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, if they have dry powder this maybe a good time to actually deploy it. But what we are advising is actually to be incredibly well diversified. So have exposure outside the U.S. and broadly outside the U.S., also have adequate exposure to alternatives because historically, they've had a lower correlation to equities.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Like?</p><p>HOOPER: Like for example gold, real estate and market mutual funds.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Kristina Hooper, thank you so much. Really interesting insight. Thank you so much.

Since then it has changed the way we connect, interact, and conduct business. More than 2.7 billion users access the network every month, making it a truly global platform with unprecedented reach. So every time Mark Zukerberg and his team make changes to the site, people sit up and take notice. On Tuesday, Facebook unveiled its plan to launch a block chain-based digital currency, Libra, by 2020. It is being dubbed as a stable coin, a term that means the currency will be pegged to real assets and fiat currencies resulting in less volatility, unlike a host of cryptocurrencies that have suffered a great deal of volatility in their prices.</p><p>If Facebook is able to influence the use of Libra over other payment methods, it could disrupt the financial world. Facebook has the reach and the numbers to make this venture successful. In fact, it could reach out to a large population that has access to the Internet (and hence Facebook) but not to banks or other financial services. What should worry us however is the lack of rules and regulations by governments. Central banks haven't kept pace with the innovation fintech has rolled out, just as digital regulation hasn't kept pace with Big Tech's plans. Fee-less currency transfers will increase competition and reduce the costs of cross-country transfers further. We have come a long way since the introduction of MasterCard and Visa gateways in 1970s. With the arrival of PayPal and e-wallets like Beam, Apple Pay and Google Pay, mean we see less of the fiat currencies like dirhams, dollars, pounds. Facebook's digital currency has big potential and is being backed by financial biggies like PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, Lyft. Yet, Facebook's ability to protect the interests of its users has been debatable. Central banks and governments need to put in place rules to ensure Big Tech companies like Facebook do not control our financial lives through digital currencies. We need to build trust into the financial digital ecosystem before it's too late.</p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-147049080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCB-7RV1-JDJN-64D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

A perfect example of this is the rise of Alibaba Group and Tencent in China that have grown exponentially with a wide array of offerings. The two giants have innovated and catered to the needs of more than a billion users in China. The experience has been rewarding and the range and quality of services offered by these Chinese firms are second to none. American firms, especially Google, have long tried to get a larger pie of Chinese users but protectionist policies of the Chinese government haven't allowed it to gain a foothold in the country. Google is shut out of China and with the passage of the new security law last month, it faces the prospect of greater difficulty in operating in Hong Kong. The tech giant is now looking to tap into the next, or perhaps the last great untapped digital market in the world - India. Its decision to invest $10 billion in the country over the next seven years is significant in these times. Over half of India's over 1.3 billion population does not have access to the Internet, which makes it a fertile ground for technology companies from all over the world. </p><p><br/>Google's investment in India is timely, which could have a significant impact on various sectors in the country such as banking, health, agriculture, digital commerce, and online education that are looking for a digital facelift to realise their potential. However, this opportunity should be complemented with some changes in the the country's tax regime and more investment in warehousing network which is key to e-commerce logistics and the agriculture industry. Moreover, as Big Tech gets stronger, it is also a moment of reckoning for governments. There should be a parallel debate on how data would be harvested, used, and protected. What sort of an impact will Google's large presence have on local innovation? Will it kill competition or energise it? Google, for instance, has already invested in a number of companies in India - a large number of them start-ups. Its latest investment could give it a firm foothold in India. For the tech behemoth, the country offers plenty of opportunities for growth after its losses in China. As for regulations, the Indian government should frame laws that ensure the privacy of its citizens is protected and is not misused by Big Tech and other digital companies.</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/23/159480009446.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/23/159480009446.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-179640356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C2-TS61-JDJN-63FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

Allowing Big Tech to determine the future of humankind would mean walking into a civilisational trap.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech has grown at a mind-boggling pace in just two decades. The companies leading the charge have not only become an integral part of our lives but are also pervasive, stealthily influencing the choices we make. What to read, watch, eat, listen to - Big Tech is good at suggestions, it lures us into its ecosystem. Now there are fears that Big Tech has grown too big for Big Governments. The US Department of Justice has, therefore, announced a broad antitrust investigation into its functioning. Even though the scope of the investigation will cover only the American landscape, the findings could give us a broader perspective on how technology is influencing our lives and how we are living by virtual terms set by them. Consider this: Google was formed in 1998; and Facebook in 2004. Today, Google performs nine out of every 10 online searches worldwide. And Facebook has connected well over two billion users and become the most popular social media network. The two firms together have taken over more than half the online advertising market.</p><p>The questions we need to ask are these: Have these firms engaged in practices that have reduced competition? Has their growing dominance stifled innovation? And what has been the impact on us consumers, who have been happy with the low prices of products and convenience of using them but could be selling our lives to these companies. The Federal Trade Commission recently fined Facebook for $5 billion. The EU has fined Google for $1.7 billion for illegally using its dominant position for online search adverts. Facebook now plans to launch its digital currency, Libra, which could be the biggest disrupter in global finance. Governments and regulators have clearly not kept pace with the speed of innovation in the tech sphere but this investigation should lead to concrete measures that protect users. Checks and balances on big technology companies are essential. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation was a great start, and the US could take a leaf out of Europe's book. Technology is fine as long as humans govern it. Allowing Big Tech to determine the future of humankind would mean walking into a civilisational trap.</p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-149959859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-6CC1-F11P-X1VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"389\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.
