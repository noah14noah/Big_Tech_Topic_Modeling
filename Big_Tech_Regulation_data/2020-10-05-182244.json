If officials there want people to stay home and avoid interacting with others at the checkout lines, they should do everything they can to encourage these kinds of services. Instead, Mayor London Breed on Friday issued an emergency edict[2] that will discourage home deliveries and will likely boost prices - and reduce choices - for consumers. The order, announced with support from the Board of Supervisors[3], caps all commission fees that home-delivery apps charge to restaurants at 15 percent. </p><p>The caps stay in place until restaurants are allowed to offer dine-in service again. These companies sometimes charge as much as 30 percent, but often charge as little as 10 percent. Everyone is sympathetic to the plight of restaurants during these trying times. In San Francisco, restaurant owners have complained about low profit margins after they pay the firms that delivery the meals to people's homes. But whenever government caps the price of a product or service, the end result always is the same: shortages[4]. 'If the city attempts to dictate contract terms between delivery services and restaurants, it would force our services to radically alter our businesses just as we desperately try to meet the needs of restaurants, delivery people, customers and our communities,' according to an April 8 letter[5] to San Francisco officials from four companies that provide deliveries (DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats). The commission caps, the letter explains[6], would increase fees for consumers, thus putting home deliveries 'out of reach for all but the city's most prosperous residents.' Furthermore, they not only provide needed food for the city's residents, but have been a lifeline for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Delivery apps also provide an ongoing source of income for drivers and restaurants - no small thing during these tough economic times. Despite the tired criticisms[7] of those who complain that these companies are flourishing during the crisis, the reality is much different. According to the letter, DoorDash has slashed fees[8] charged to independent restaurants by 50 percent. Grubhub has provided $30 million in aid to restaurants. Uber Eats waived customer fees for orders from small restaurants. Postmates has waived commissions for new brick-and-mortar retail merchants in San Francisco. These are just a few of the ways that these app-based companies - like many companies[9] in myriad industries - have creatively confronted the COVID-19 challenge. It's best to let voluntary relationships sort themselves out, rather than allow government to impose heavy-handed and counterproductive regulations. All companies need the flexibility to determine their own price structures and run their businesses as they know best. App-based delivery companies rightly are concerned that San Francisco's emergency order will be mimicked elsewhere. Officials in Chicago and New York, for instance, already have discussed similar measures[10]. Some people worry that it might be hard to get rid of the cumbersome new rules even after the crisis passes. San Francisco's edict was supported by the local restaurant lobby[11] which, presumably, would see the foolishness of price controls if the city capped restaurant profits to protect struggling homebound residents. Ironically, many restaurants could suffer the most from the caps, given that they could depress demand for deliveries and, as Restaurant Dive noted[12], 'force delivery companies to stop doing business with lower-cost restaurants.' One of the reasons Americans have survived the economic clampdown as well as they have is because of our market-based system[13] that allows prices to free to rise and fall based on supply and demand. This is how markets work every day, even if we don't like when some things cost more than we'd prefer to pay. Whenever governments mess with that process, customers can't get what they need - or have to wait in line or do without. Instead of waiting to see the easily predictable consequences[14] of the edict, the city should roll back the regulations and let restaurants and app-based delivery companies work out their own arrangements. San Franciscans need food-delivery services now more than ever, so it would be tragic if the city made it harder for residents to access them.

The cross-pollination between Pennsylvania Avenue and Sand Hill Road led some political activists to describe the valley as a \"retirement community\" for White House operatives headed west.</p><p> That bicoastal bonhomie has dimmed amid a cascade of scandals over data privacy, the spread of misinformation and foreign intrusion on the companies' platforms.</p><p> \"The reality is, the honeymoon is over and people are rightly demanding more regulation and transparency,\" said Steve Westly, the former California state controller and a venture capital investor in Menlo Park.</p><p> Among the 2020 candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has set the pace on the issue, laying out a plan last month to break up the largest tech firms. Under Warren's proposal, the firms would be banned from operating marketplaces or exchanges while participating in those platforms. For example, Amazon couldn't run its online store while selling Amazon-branded products on the same site, and those functions would have to be split apart into separate companies. Some other recent tech mergers, like Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, would also have to be rolled back. The process, Warren argues, would make it harder for the corporate titans to push newer upstarts out of business.</p><p> While few of her rivals have gone that far, several are focusing on the issue. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is calling for stronger enforcement of antitrust laws - regulations to promote competition within industries - and proposing a \"data tax,\" with tech companies having to pay up when they profit from large amounts of user data. The funds would go to new cybersecurity efforts.</p><p> \"We've had massive data breaches and people's identities stolen, and (tech companies) can no longer, with credibility, say, 'Hey, we don't need any rules of the road,'\" the Minnesota senator told reporters during a recent visit to San Francisco.</p><p> Candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former housing secretary Julian Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have also voiced support for increased use of antitrust rules. Even Sen. Cory Booker, a Stanford grad with close Silicon Valley ties who once co-founded a video startup, has tough words for big tech firms.</p><p> \"They are profiting off of our private data in ways that I think violate our basic, fundamental freedoms and rights,\" Booker declared at a town hall event in Washington last week, saying he wanted to get back to the days when \"we used to do a lot better job of enforcing antitrust laws and broke up big companies during my childhood.\"</p><p> Notably, Sen. Kamala Harris - who represents many of the tech titans - hasn't said where she stands on breaking up the companies or using antitrust laws more aggressively, although she has had tough questions for executives in several Senate hearings.</p><p> As they campaign in the Bay Area in advance of California's March 2020 primary, all of the candidates will likely be pressured to articulate specific positions on the topic.</p><p> Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat whose district includes the headquarters of Apple and other big tech firms, said he hoped to see candidates embrace more nuanced perspectives. In an interview, he proposed stronger regulations preventing companies from using their platforms to unfairly advantage their products while not actually splitting the firms up - Amazon could still sell Amazon-branded batteries on its own site, just not put them at the top of every search result for \"batteries.\"</p><p> \"I think we have to have a scalpel, not a sledgehammer approach,\" said Khanna, one of the national co-chairs for Sanders' campaign. \"We shouldn't have the only big tech companies being in China, with Alibaba and Baidu and Tencent - the focus should not be breaking something up just because it's big.\"</p><p> The drumbeat of tech scandals has emboldened the candidates' rhetoric. Trump's victory - and the role Facebook and other social media companies played as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 election - marked a turning point for how Democrats viewed big tech.</p><p> \"The Democratic Party saw the tech executives as magicians,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the liberal Open Markets Institute and a supporter of Warren's plan, \"but it turns out they were just marketers.\"</p><p> Some executives have shown a willingness to accept moderate new regulations in the wake of the controversies. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called for \"a more active role for governments and regulators\" in setting rules for the internet on issues like election integrity and data privacy.</p><p> Other Silicon Valley leaders are pushing back more forcefully. \"It is in vogue right now to attack tech, and some of that is deserved and a whole lot of it is not,\" said Carl Guardino, the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business coalition that includes big tech companies. \"If the reward for success is the destruction of a company determined through a political process and not the marketplace, what message does that send to future entrepreneurs?\"</p><p> Even as they bash the tech giants, the candidates are still coming to Silicon Valley to raise money in the affluent and heavily Democratic region. Harris, Booker, Klobuchar, Castro and others have held private fundraisers in San Francisco or the valley in recent weeks. (Notably, Warren has sworn off big-dollar, closed-door fundraisers completely.)</p><p> Local observers said that the tech community hadn't coalesced around supporting any one candidate, with Harris, Booker, former Vice President Joe Biden and former congressman Beto O'Rourke among the most common choices.</p><p> The candidates are also making wide use of the big tech firms' services in getting their messages to voters and building their campaign infrastructure. Ads on Facebook and Google, as well as YouTube and Instagram, which are owned by the two giants, have become a key tool for campaigns to reach new voters, expand their email lists and solicit donations.</p><p> In the first three months of 2019, the Democratic presidential candidates spent $3.7 million on Facebook ads and $1.6 million on Google ads, according to an analysis by the political firm Bully Pulpit Interactive. Meanwhile, Trump's re-election campaign and its joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee spent $3.8 million on Facebook and $2.4 million on Google over the same period.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-4263485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABD503A1E409 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWK-B141-DXVP-V1W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bulletin<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This new service, available via a mobile app, allows UK residents with a debit card issued by any UK bank or financial entity to seamlessly and quickly send money abroad from their smartphone with low costs, bank-level security and customer support via in-app chat, web and e-mail. In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, PagoFX will allow customers to use the service to transfer money abroad without any fees at all for the next two months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PagoFX, which works as an autonomous FinTech start-up with more than 50 people in Madrid, London and Brussels, brings together the best of both worlds through an easy-to-use app: Santander's expertise in international payments, foreign exchange and high security standards, with the digital innovation and competitive pricing of the fintech sector. It is one of the most affordable providers through its competitive and transparent pricing, including real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>Ana Bot\u00edn, Group executive chairman of Banco Santander, comments \"PagoFX makes it possible to transfer money internationally easily, at low cost, and with the security and peace of mind that comes from a regulated entity backed by an international bank. This is a unique proposition and we hope it will help many people and businesses. It draws on our world-class technology and talent to deliver a new and highly relevant service for everyone in the open market.\"</p><p>The launch is another milestone in Santander's four-year (2019-2022), E20bn digital technology pledge. Payments are a cornerstone of the banking group's open financial services platform, being delivered to create fast, simple and safe digital services for consumers, merchants and SMEs around the world. Capitalising on successful and proven technologies, PagoFX is the open-market version of Santander's existing international money transfer service One Pay FX, which offers transparent and quick international transfers to its bank customers in key countries in Europe and the Americas.</p><p>PagoFX is designed with trust, safety and the consumer at its core, featuring Santander's extensive and thorough bank-grade product validation process:</p><p>-Quick but comprehensive verification process before making the first payment to guarantee the protection of data and money. </p><p>-Every cost shown upfront with no hidden fees: users will know exactly how much they're paying and how much their recipient will get. This includes real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>-Bank-level security with the same product validation process as any Santander Group product has, this means the company implements cybersecurity, financial crime and risk requirements.</p><p>PagoFX is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority(FCA). This safeguards funds until the associated payment has been sent, so users are fully protected in the case of defective execution of any payment.</p><p>A dedicated support team of people provide PagoFX users with expert advice and assistance for any type of enquiry via in-app chat, web and e-mail.</p><p>With the PagoFX service, international payments can currently be made in selected currencies from the UK to the US, the eurozone, Poland, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Czech Republic, with plans to introduce further currencies and payment options in the short term.</p><p>The service will be rolled-out to sole traders and small-and-medium-sized enterprises in the UK via the PagoFX website and mobile app in the near future. In addition, PagoFX will be launched in other European countries later this year and be present in around 20 markets in the next three to four years.</p><p>As a FinTech start-up, PagoFX has attracted talent from several big tech companies, such as Amazon, PayPal and Intuit, and start-ups, and works together with the strong global payments team at Santander, which includes executives with digital and banking backgrounds.</p><p>The no-fee programme, deployed due to the coronavirus pandemic, is available to all registered UK users of the PagoFX app on Android or iOS. Until 16th June 2020, PagoFX shall waive international money transfer fees on transactions up to a limit of \u00a33,000 per user. This limit is cumulative-once you submit a single or multiple transactions above the \u00a33,000 limit, PagoFX's standard fees shall apply on all amounts above the limit. Standard low-cost fee for transferring money to the eurozone, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and the Czech Republic is 0.70% of the sent amount. For transfers to the US, Poland and Denmark, the fee is 0.80% of sent amount. PagoFX shows all the information upfront and offers real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>This article is supplied by Only Strategic Financial Newslink (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.onlystrategic.com\">www.onlystrategic.com</url>).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNKLNK-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNKLNK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR0-7VS1-F159-5007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344849</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 OnlyStrategic Bankingnewslink<logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61314\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Banking Newslink</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61201\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Trend</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002OTO</classCode><className>BANCO SANTANDER SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SANT (LIS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SANT (BIT)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SANB3 (BOVESPA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SAN (WSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SAN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SAN (MCE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SAN (BMV)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BNC (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Santander</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>West &amp;

This is a unique proposition and we hope it will help many people and businesses.'It draws on our world-class technology and talent to deliver a new and highly relevant service for everyone in the open market.' </p><p>Fintech app Chip raises 2.5m record crowdfunding[1] The launch is another milestone inSantander's four-year (2019-2022), 20 billion-euro digital technology pledge. Payments are a cornerstone of the banking group's open financial services platform, being delivered to create fast, simple and safe digital services for consumers, merchants and SMEs around the world.Capitalising on successful and proven technologies, PagoFX is the open-market version ofSantander's existing international money transfer service One Pay FX, which offers transparent and quick international transfers to its bank customers in key countries in Europe and the Americas.The service will be rolled-out to sole traders and small-and-medium-sized enterprises in the UK via the PagoFX website and mobile app in the near future. In addition, PagoFX will be launched in other European countries later this year and be present in around 20 markets in the next three to four years.As a fintech start-up, PagoFX has attracted talent from several big tech companies, such as Amazon, PayPal and Intuit, and start-ups, and works together with the strong global payments team at Santander, which includes executives with digital and banking backgrounds.

Reportedly written by the bank's head of innovation, the missive warned that a large chunk of the Spanish incumbent's profits were at risk - specifically, those generated via international money transfers - because of the growing success of fintech challengers, such as London-headquartered TransferWise.</p><p><br/>Fast-forward three years, and today Santander is launching a standalone money transfer app, presumably in a bid to avoid the trappings of innovator's dilemma. The new proposition is open to Santander and non-Santander customers and has been developed by a team working largely outside of the bank - a startup within a multi-national corporation, if you will - and has grown to around 50 team members working across Madrid, London, and Brussels.<br/>Dubbed \"PagoFX\" and launched in the U.K. first, the mobile app lets anyone with a U.K. debit card send money abroad at claimed mid-market FX rates and with a low transparent fee. In addition, it offers \"bank-level\" security and customer support via in-app chat, web and e-mail.<br/>In a virtual press briefing, Pago's CMO Victoria Yasinetskaya explained that Pago's unique positioning is that it effectively offers the best of both worlds: bank level security and trust (the app is co-branded alongside Santander) combined with the price competitiveness, convenience and user experience of a modern fintech solution. The thinking is that a segment of customers still trust an incumbent bank more than a challenger, and therefore a Santander-backed standalone money transfer app will be able to find room in the market.<br/>During the same press briefing, Pago CEO Cedric Menager explained that PagoFX is essentially an open-market version of Santander's existing international money transfer service \"One Pay FX,\" which offers competitive international transfers to existing Santander customers in various countries in Europe and the Americas. He also revealed that the Pago team was mainly big tech and fintech in its background, with various team members having worked at companies such as Amazon, PayPal and Intuit, and a number of unnamed startups.<br/>On price, and without doing a forensic comparison, PagoFX looks to be broadly competitive with challengers, though not necessarily the very cheapest, depending on how you value payment method (e.g. card vs bank transfer) or speed.<br/>\"Transferring money to the eurozone, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and the Czech Republic is 0.70% of the sent amount. For transfers to the U.S., Poland and Denmark, the fee is 0.80% of sent amount,\" explains Pago. (At launch, however, fees are being waived on transactions up to a limit of 3,000 GBP per user to help support customers during the coronavirus crisis).<br/>\u00a0<br/>Cue statement from Ana Bot\u00edn, Group executive chairman of Banco Santander (who is rumoured to have given the project the green light after being shown a demonstration of TransferWise by her son): \"PagoFX makes it possible to transfer money internationally easily, at low cost, and with the security and peace of mind that comes from a regulated entity backed by an international bank. This is a unique proposition and we hope it will help many people and businesses. It draws on our world-class technology and talent to deliver a new and highly relevant service for everyone in the open market\".<br/>Meanwhile, I pinged two U.K. fintech money transfer competitors for comment.<br/>\"It's great to see a large legacy financial institution moving to give customers a better deal as they play catch-up with the fintech sector,\" Azimo co-founder and Chairman Michael Kent told me over WhatsApp. \"By improving their product and moving prices closer to ours and other digital players they can finally save their customers money at an uncertain time when everyone is watching the pennies and cents\".<br/>He also pointed out that, as it stands, Pago isn't the most direct competitor since it doesn't cover developing and emerging markets, which is Azimo's main corridor focus.<br/>In a statement given to TechCrunch, Kristo Kaarmann, CEO and co-founder of TransferWise, says: \"Banks and brokers have been misleading customers about the true cost of making international payments for decades, advertising transfers as 'free' or '0% commission' then adding a high mark-up on the exchange rate. But there are promising signs that PagoFX signals a more transparent approach from Santander. If so, it's evidence that the transparency and low-prices we've been pioneering are on the way to becoming the new industry standard as customers demand a better service\".<br/>Kaarmann also issued a warning to existing Santander customers with regards to the FX rate they are offered within Santander's existing banking apps. \"If it's necessary to download PagoFX separately to achieve transparency, customers using Santander's standard service will continue to be short changed,\" he says.<br/>His argument is that PagoFX, like One Pay FX before it, will only benefit the most price conscious consumers. \"We urge Santander to go a step further and adopt full transparency across all their international money transfer services as the standard, not just on specific products and currency routes,\" he adds.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-848598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR6-NHN1-DYDW-754G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002OTO</classCode><className>BANCO SANTANDER SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002B14</classCode><className>INTUIT INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

This new service, available via a mobile app, allows UK residents with a debit card issued by any UK bank or financial entity to seamlessly and quickly send money abroad from their smartphone with low costs, bank-level security and customer support via in-app chat, web and e-mail. In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, PagoFX will allow customers to use the service to transfer money abroad without any fees at all for the next two months.</p><p>PagoFX, which works as an autonomous fintech start-up with more than 50 people in Madrid, London and Brussels, brings together the best of both worlds through an easy-to-use app: Santander's expertise in international payments, foreign exchange and high security standards, with the digital innovation and competitive pricing of the fintech sector. It is one of the most affordable providers through its competitive and transparent pricing, including real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>Ana Botn, Group executive chairman of Banco Santander, said: \"PagoFX makes it possible to transfer money internationally easily, at low cost, and with the security and peace of mind that comes from a regulated entity backed by an international bank. This is a unique proposition and we hope it will help many people and businesses. It draws on our world-class technology and talent to deliver a new and highly relevant service for everyone in the open market.\"</p><p>The launch is another milestone in Santander's four-year (2019-2022), 20 billion-euro digital technology pledge. Payments are a cornerstone of the banking group's open financial services platform, being delivered to create fast, simple and safe digital services for consumers, merchants and SMEs around the world. Capitalising on successful and proven technologies, PagoFX is the open-market version of Santander's existing international money transfer service One Pay FX, which offers transparent and quick international transfers to its bank customers in key countries in Europe and the Americas.</p><p>PagoFX is designed with trust, safety and the consumer at its core, featuring Santander's extensive and thorough bank-grade product validation process:</p><p>* Quick but comprehensive verification process before making the first payment to guarantee the protection of data and money.</p><p>* Every cost shown upfront with no hidden fees: users will know exactly how much they're paying and how much their recipient will get. This includes real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>* Bank-level security with the same product validation process as any Santander Group product has, this means the company implements cybersecurity, financial crime and risk requirements.</p><p>* PagoFX is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK regulator for financial services firms. This safeguards funds until the associated payment has been sent, so users are fully protected in the case of defective execution of any payment.</p><p>* A dedicated support team of people provide PagoFX users with expert advice and assistance for any type of enquiry via in-app chat, web and e-mail.</p><p>With the PagoFX service, international payments can currently be made in selected currencies from the UK to the US, the eurozone, Poland, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Czech Republic, with plans to introduce further currencies and payment options in the short term.</p><p>The service will be rolled-out to sole traders and small-and-medium-sized enterprises in the UK via the PagoFX website and mobile app in the near future. In addition, PagoFX will be launched in other European countries later this year and be present in around 20 markets in the next three to four years.</p><p>As a fintech start-up, PagoFX has attracted talent from several big tech companies, such as Amazon, PayPal and Intuit, and start-ups, and works together with the strong global payments team at Santander, which includes executives with digital and banking backgrounds.</p><p>The no-fee programme, deployed due to the coronavirus pandemic, is available to all registered UK users of the PagoFX app on Android or iOS. Until 16 June 2020, PagoFX shall waive international money transfer fees on transactions up to a limit of 3,000 GBP per user. This limit is cumulative - once you submit a single or multiple transactions above the 3,000 GBP limit, PagoFX's standard fees shall apply on all amounts above the limit. Standard low-cost fee for transferring money to the eurozone, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and the Czech Republic is 0.70% of the sent amount. For transfers to the US, Poland and Denmark, the fee is 0.80% of sent amount. PagoFX shows all the information upfront and offers real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>More at PagoFX.com</p><p>Banco Santander (SAN SM, STD US, BNC LN) is a leading retail and commercial bank, founded in 1857 and headquartered in Spain.

The product, which is open for everyone no matter who the user banks with, is expected to be launched in other European countries this year and be present in 20 markets in three to four years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banco Santander today announced the launch of PagoFX, a low-cost international money transfer service, in the UK. This new service, available via a mobile app, allows UK residents with a debit card issued by any UK bank or financial entity to seamlessly and quickly send money abroad from their smartphone with low costs, bank-level security and customer support via in-app chat, web and e-mail. In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, PagoFX will allow customers to use the service to transfer money abroad without any fees at all for the next two months.</p><p>PagoFX, which works as an autonomous fintech start-up with more than 50 people in Madrid, London and Brussels, brings together the best of both worlds through an easy-to-use app: Santanders expertise in international payments, foreign exchange and high security standards, with the digital innovation and competitive pricing of the fintech sector. It is one of the most affordable providers through its competitive and transparent pricing, including real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>The launch is another milestone in Santanders four-year (2019-2022), 20 billion-euro digital technology pledge. Payments are a cornerstone of the banking groups open financial services platform, being delivered to create fast, simple and safe digital services for consumers, merchants and SMEs around the world. Capitalising on successful and proven technologies, PagoFX is the open-market version of Santanders existing international money transfer service One Pay FX, which offers transparent and quick international transfers to its bank customers in key countries in Europe and the Americas.</p><p>PagoFX is designed with trust, safety and the consumer at its core, featuring Santanders extensive and thorough bank-grade product validation process:</p><p>Quick but comprehensive verification process before making the first payment to guarantee the protection of data and money.</p><p>Every cost shown upfront with no hidden fees: users will know exactly how much theyre paying and how much their recipient will get. This includes real-time foreign exchange rates.</p><p>Bank-level security with the same product validation process as any Santander Group product has, this means the company implements cybersecurity, financial crime and risk requirements.</p><p>PagoFX is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK regulator for financial services firms. This safeguards funds until the associated payment has been sent, so users are fully protected in the case of defective execution of any payment.</p><p>A dedicated support team of people provide PagoFX users with expert advice and assistance for any type of enquiry via in-app chat, web and e-mail.</p><p>With the PagoFX service, international payments can currently be made in selected currencies from the UK to the US, the eurozone, Poland, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Czech Republic, with plans to introduce further currencies and payment options in the short term.</p><p>The service will be rolled-out to sole traders and small-and-medium-sized enterprises in the UK via the PagoFX website and mobile app in the near future. In addition, PagoFX will be launched in other European countries later this year and be present in around 20 markets in the next three to four years.</p><p>As a fintech start-up, PagoFX has attracted talent from several big tech companies, such as Amazon, PayPal and Intuit, and start-ups, and works together with the strong global payments team at Santander, which includes executives with digital and banking backgrounds.</p><p>The no-fee programme, deployed due to the coronavirus pandemic, is available to all registered UK users of the PagoFX app on Android or iOS. Until 16 June 2020, PagoFX shall waive international money transfer fees on transactions up to a limit of 3,000 GBP per user. This limit is cumulative  once you submit a single or multiple transactions above the 3,000 GBP limit, PagoFXs standard fees shall apply on all amounts above the limit. Standard low-cost fee for transferring money to the eurozone, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and the Czech Republic is 0.70% of the sent amount. For transfers to the US, Poland and Denmark, the fee is 0.80% of sent amount. PagoFX shows all the information upfront and offers real-time foreign exchange rates. 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNCMW-172815193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNCMW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPY-9511-F11P-X480-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420008</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

I cited a Forbes article that featured an interview with Andrew Svetly, Florida Hospital's chief medical information officer, who said possessing clinician credentials helped him earn respect from physicians and hospital administrators.</p><p/><p>That kind of in-depth domain knowledge would probably be a plus for any CIO but may be especially critical for health care, an industry with specialized operational requirements and lots of regulatory and security issues.</p><p/><p>As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InformationWeek</emphasis> reports, AT&amp;T's health care division has <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">appointed Geeta Nayyar, MD, MBA as its first chief medical information officer</emphasis>. Nayyar, a practicing rheumatologist, helped implement an electronic health record system for the faculty practice at George Washington University while she was studying for her MBA there. Randall Porter, assistant VP of AT&amp;T ForHealth, told InformationWeek that CMIOs who practice medicine are more in touch with the rapidly changing health care sector.</p><p/><p>AT&amp;T wants to be a big player in the health care market -- along with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">just about every other technology vendor out there</emphasis>. As IT Business Edge's Loraine Lawson wrote last summer, health care IT was once considered a niche market, served primarily by smaller vendors with proprietary solutions. But big tech vendors became seriously interested after the federal government announced plans to spend some $20 billion updating the country's medical records and other IT systems.</p><p/><p>In a post on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hot market for IT talent with experience in electronic health records</emphasis>, IT Business Edge's Susan Hall mentioned a recent a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that predicted health care spending will make up nearly 20 percent of the U.S. economy by 2019 and research from RNCOS forecasting 24 percent spending growth on health care technology in the U.S. between 2012 and 2014.</p><p/><p>The InformationWeek article mentions several IT health initiatives in which AT&amp;T is involved, including a joint effort with the Department of Health and Human Services and the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) to improve self-management training of diabetic patients. AT&amp;T will contribute $100,000 to the AADE to fund the initiative, which will start with a pilot in Texas, and will provide 150 smartphones with voice and data plans for patients, diabetes educators and other coaches.</p><p/><p>Chief medical information officers, whether or not they have medical training, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">face plenty of challenges in implementing new health care technologies</emphasis>. As interest in health care IT continues to grow, the CMIO role will probably grow right along with it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITBCOM-83387410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITBCOM2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KJ9-0W01-JC90-T4MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433695</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><timeReceived>01:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Quinstreet, Inc.

What's next in SaaS products for SAP?</p><p>It's still a big task to get the mid-size enterprise product out to the market.</p><p>At SAP research we are assuming that if this is rolled out in the next two or three years we will see demand for verticalisation of ByDesign in the same way we have structured our large enterprise products.</p><p>We are looking at what verticals are of most interest to serve up first and what is the right support model for partners of SAP to provide verticals on top of our products.</p><p>We anticipate the number of verticals will be much larger than it is in our large enterprise space because of the number of niche markets in small and medium enterprises.</p><p>Why has it been so difficult to get ByDesign out? In Australia the product is running 12 months behind schedule and won't be here until the middle of next year.</p><p>The difficulty is that we don't have any benchmarking for that level of enterprise resource planning software. We are breaking new ground here.</p><p>So there's customer resistance?</p><p>No, it's not so much customer resistance, it's a question of how can we serve customers at the price they want to pay and where we are profitable enough that the analysts are happy and the stock exchange is happy.</p><p>This is an equation that is hard to achieve right now because we don't have the benchmark information. You have Salesforce.com of course, but that's not a full enterprise resource planning system. It's just a tiny piece of ERP.</p><p>SAP is breaking new ground here, which is not in our tradition.</p><p>We have always been excellent fast followers but here we took the risk of being first and now we need the learning curve to understand how we can get profitable operation on one side at the price expected by the customer on the other.</p><p>That means we have to look into the operation and see how we can optimise it.</p><p>At the end of the day it doesn't help us if we have to pay the customer to buy our systems.</p><p>It's not so much functionality or customer acceptance, it's a question of what is the business model to make it a successful product.</p><p>What are you doing right now to address that problem?</p><p>We are looking into how to optimise the consultancy work required to introduce such a system: what can we automate; what new methods of consulting services are possible, such as outsourcing into areas with cheaper labour; how much can we put in the customer's hands without us doing it so we can give them great tools to adapt the product to their particular needs.</p><p>That's where the composition aspect becomes very important.</p><p>What excites you in your research work at the moment?</p><p>From a SAP perspective it is the enterprise service-oriented architecture we introduced several years ago.</p><p>For a long time people didn't understand why we did that when we already had the modules.</p><p>We got comments like: what is the difference between a service and a module?</p><p>Maybe you can really challenge us and ask in an intra-enterprise environment if you really need these services. I think you do need them, but OK, it's debatable.</p><p>Now, with internet services, with inter-enterprise collaboration, when I want a service from you and you want a service from me, the best way to offer that is through an enterprise SOA.</p><p>At SAP research the internet of services is a core research field we are working on.</p><p>We have the chance to bring about the enterprise SOA 2.0, the inter-enterprise SOA.</p><p>That's a big, big business. We consider it a potential next big thing. That's why we are engaged in the Smart Service CRC. It's one of the pieces of the puzzle that can turn vision into reality.</p><p>At SAP we have coined the term business web.</p><p>What we believe will happen at the end of the day is that businesses will come together and from a virtual enterprise, a business web just to perform a particular service and then go away and reform in new ways.</p><p>How would this work in practice?</p><p>A recent example comes from Procter and Gamble, which decided the best way to do R&amp;D is to contract it out so they go out and ask their partners to join a virtual team and create a product.</p><p>Once that's done the production happens in China or whatever and it's all a done deal.</p><p>That's a perfect example of how a business web can work, but why should it only be R&amp;D? Why not all kinds of services?</p><p>I have a 17-month-old baby. When the child was born I had so much paperwork to do: birth registration, insurance, tax deductions and so on.</p><p>While many of these services are available online I had to keep on entering and re-entering the same information for each service.</p><p>What if tomorrow the hospital offered a service that would take care of all the data entry around birth? It could say to new parents: you take care of your baby and we'll take care of the paperwork. You get home and everything is done.</p><p>Good luck is all I can say. We have watched e-health projects grind along for years with few results. Once you get into the politics of people trying to interconnect you get a nightmare. Why is that?</p><p>Because the interfaces among participants are not defined well enough to allow for this enterprise SOA 2.0.</p><p>If the trust and identity management is well established and they have well exposed services, there's no reason they shouldn't do it.</p><p>It's not a matter of willingness, it's a matter of making sure data is being treated securely enough and data interfaces are properly aligned, and that's hard work.</p><p>When I say purchasing order and you say purchasing order do we really means the same -- do we have the same semantic understanding.</p><p>That's why it is a pain in the neck.</p><p>Do you think we are at a point now is where the technology is way ahead of our business understanding?</p><p>I wouldn't say way ahead. At SAP research if you go through my team you would hardly have anyone speaking about web services. Why? Because that's a technical vehicle we understand we have to deal with, but the real question is what is the business value -- the business case.</p><p>Our research is driven with these kinds of questions.</p><p>You speak about the ``internet of things'' being one of the next big tech waves and that's linked to the adoption of enabling technologies such as radio frequency identification. We have not seen the sort of mass use of RFID that early enthusiasts predicted. Do you think we are finally getting to the place where RFID becomes a mass market technology?</p><p>Maybe not, and I don't care. When we look at the internet of things we say it consists of a variety of technologies. If you want to do it with RFID and it suits your business case, that's fine. If someone else wants to do it with a printed version of a 2D barcode or the like, it should be done that way and it should work as well.</p><p>We have developed our systems so that we are agnostic about individual technologies.</p><p>We want to have object identification, contextual information that could be location-based or environment-based.</p><p>That requires different types of sensor technology. In some cases it would be RFID, in others it might be sensor nodes capable of transmitting speed, or maybe temperature information.</p><p>Almost any product that exists today has some prints somewhere on it.</p><p>The success of the internet of things will not rely on the success of RFID. Maybe they will come along together, maybe not.</p><p>The term cloud computing gets thrown around a lot, but up till now that cloud has been pretty much US-developed, and mainly a consumer-centric. With your work around the future of the internet and with the EU Framework program, do you see the cloud becoming more of an enterprise cloud and having a more European flavour?</p><p>Yes to the enterprise cloud. The European cloud is a hot debate right now and I'm in favour of considering that, but I know there are others who believe that game is already lost to the US.</p><p>I don't think we should see it that way and I don't think Australia or any other country should see it that way, because the implications are tremendous.</p><p>At the end of the day the clouds will form but they can't be solely American, privately owned clouds. We need a good balance.</p><p>I don't want to over-regulate anything but you can see from European reaction to Intel and Microsoft over monopolism how risky that can be.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if the European Commission looked at cloud computing in the same way.</p><p>Overall I would say the cloud shouldn't be out of one region in the world, the US or any other region. It should be available all over in a fair and open manner -- then it becomes an enterprise cloud.</p><p>The benefits you could gain from cloud-type services would be tremendous.</p><p>Putting your European Framework program hat on for a minute, why should Australia get involved with is purely European research? What would Australia get from your input?</p><p>We have four major regions in the world: the US, Europe, India and China. If you look into these economies they all regard technology as being the motor of innovation in almost all sectors.</p><p>The question for Australia is in which of these are you going to play a role? If you sit outside you are going to be lost.</p><p>With China I don't think the Australian and Chinese approaches to innovation are very much in sync.</p><p>Let's leave India out for a second because I'm not sure whether India will really pay a role at the end of the day.</p><p>Then you have the US and Europe.</p><p>In the US there's a very strong private-sector approach and there's plenty of venture capital funding -- which makes life easier, but it's a lottery.</p><p>If Australia can play that game that's good, but from what I have seen so far I don't think you can do that.</p><p>Then there's the European way, which is to say we don't have the tradition of venture capital funds but we have a tradition of nurturing innovation by supporting universities and other science communities, which you also do in Australia.</p><p>In Europe, though, they added another step with the Seventh Framework, which was to say invention is not enough, it has to be turned into viable products in the market.</p><p>We figured out in Europe how to get through the last mile from the invention to the product.</p><p>Australia hasn't done that so far, from what I can see. Participating in Framework could help Australia to travel the last mile.</p><p>An invention can look great but getting to a commercially viable product can be a long and risky road.</p><p>In Europe, for these high-risk transfers from invention to product we have the Framework program in which industry can participate.</p><p>Industry is often asked to lead these consortiums so the invention from the university is done in a combined way with industry.</p><p>At least in the ICT space you have no company here that has the right capacity to take these inventions and turn them into innovation.</p><p>If you joined Framework you could learn how to do that.</p><p>At what level of participation in Framework would you urge the Australian Government to join?</p><p>There's full partner, associate level and then project by project.</p><p>I believe the associate level is appropriate. The Framework program is very competitive. In the last call of the Seventh Framework program there were 243 proposals, of which just four were selected for funding.</p><p>You need to have a very good understanding of how to write the proposals so the independent reviewers will rate your proposal highly enough to succeed against the competition.</p><p>If you are a full partner from the beginning you may end up paying a lot into the big pot and getting very little out of it.</p><p>I would come in as an associate with the Eighth Framework to learn the proposal game and then join as a full partner later.</p><p>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO</p><p>LUTZ HEUSER</p><p>On ByDesign: The difficulty is that we don't have any benchmarking for that level of enterprise resource planning software</p><p>On research: At SAP internet services is a core research field we are working on</p><p>On cloud computing: The European cloud is a hot debate and I'm in favour of considering that, but I know there are others who believe that game is already

Social media encourages greater transparency and accountability, expands consumer choice and promotes freedom of speech. These are values we hold dear in the capitalist West.<br/>Yet, authoritarian socialist regimes across the world deliberately restrict their citizens' access to social media. The empowering of the individual that social media enables is contrary to the ideological collectivism of socialist dictatorships. Unfortunately the world is littered with examples of those.<br/>The People's Republic of China have banned Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, amongst others, forcing users to use China-only media outlets like WeChat and Weibo. Indeed, CNN describe the Chinese censorship programme as \"more extensive and advanced than in any other country in the world\". Chinese socialism zealously silences its people, and internet censorship is a large piece of this puzzle. This is also having an adverse effect on enterprise. Chinese companies are being forced to circumvent censorship through a VPN in order to access blocked websites.<br/>Unfortunately, but predictably, the situation in China is replicated in other socialist countries. The National Union of Workers of the Press of Venezuela discovered that 115 media outlets have been closed down since 2013. In April 2019, the Venezuelan government disrupted access to major social media sites and blocked BBC and CNN from displaying images of protestors. In Cuba, the Freedom on the Net 2018 report criticised the lack of internet freedom and described Cuba as one of the \"most repressive environments for information and communication technologies\".<br/>Despite the rise in social media usage in the UK, state supervision over internet freedom is not absent. In April 2019, the Government published the Online Harms White Paper which set out the government's plans for a regulator on internet content. This would force websites to remove 'bad content' (e.g. hate speech) and even block or fine sites that do not comply. Our friends at the excellent Adam Smith Institute have fervently opposed such measures, writing in response that \"the Government should be ashamed of themselves for leading the Western world into internet censorship\". They rightly conclude elsewhere that this report is \"at its core, illiberal, and incompatible with English ideas of harm and freedom\".<br/>Journalist's fears over internet freedom were also heightened when Jeremy Corbyn, supporter of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, warned British free press that \"change is coming\". Both main political parties seem committed to cracking down on free speech, online and elsewhere.<br/>More than ever, we are faced with the threat of curbs to internet freedom from all across the world. Social media is a great output to exercise accountability and freedom of expression; and it is this reason that it is under threat in socialist countries worldwide. We must ensure this form of government intervention finds no foothold in this country too.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-70219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP8-SKF1-JCMP-5401-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Taxpayers Alliance, Great Britain All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Taxpayers Alliance</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And thanks to a nearly $10 billion bet that Wall Street has placed on a New York-based company called Sirius Satellite Radio Inc., \"pay radio\" could soon be added to the hit-and-run carnage.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whether that happens or not will depend, oddly enough, on how much appeal radio <person><nameText>shock jock Howard Stern </nameText></person>turns out to have with everyday people, and we'll begin to get the first glimpse of an answer in just about six weeks time, when Stern's radio show goes live Jan. 9 on the Sirius network.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We'll turn in a minute to the particulars of what Stern has to do with the future of pay radio, and what his success or failure is likely to mean for the man with the most skin showing in this venture - Sirius Chairman and CEO Mel Karmazin.  </p><p>But first, a brief refresher course on what pay radio is all about.  </p><p>Over the past decade, investors have poured more than $20 billion into this much-hyped sector, mainly to help the only two companies - New York-based Sirius and its rival, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. of Washington, D.C. - construct competing high-technology delivery networks that now stretch from orbiting satellites to repeater towers that dot the landscape of North America.  </p><p>From the start, the idea was that people would be willing to pay a monthly fee for a kind of radio version of HBO, only instead of a cable-TV converter box in your den you'd get a specially built radio for the dashboard of your car, or maybe the countertop in your kitchen.  </p><p>WITH such a device, you'd be able to receive not just conventional AM and FM signals from local stations, but multiple channels of high-quality, static-free programming beamed from satellites so that listeners in Los Angeles or St. Louis would be able to tune into the same programming as listeners in New York and Miami.  </p><p>Creating the infrastructure for all this - from satellite launches to the manufacturing of radios and the signing of deals with automakers to install them in their new car models - was under way, and much of it had been completed before a single customer had signed up for a single month of pay radio service from either company. But construction of these rival fields of dreams has now been pretty much completed, and the two companies have been aggressively signing up subscribers for the past three years.  </p><p>From the start, the numbers left Wall Street underwhelmed, and by the start of 2003, Sirius' stock price had skidded from $30 to barely 80 cents, with XM not far behind.  </p><p>Since then, Sirius's stock has recovered less than a third of its lost ground, in part because its own published numbers suggest that listeners are disconnecting from the service in greater percentages than the company appears to acknowledge.  </p><p>In the media game, this is known as subscriber \"churn,\" and it can eat a company alive. Though XM Satellite doesn't publish its churn numbers, Sirius does, and they show that during the most recent three-month reporting period, ended Sept. 30, roughly 36,000 subscribers decided not to renew the service.  </p><p>The company describes this in filings as a 1.8 percent churn rate, but mostly it represents subscribers who had signed up via annual contracts a year or more earlier and have now decided not to renew. Using those subscribers in the calculation and not the ones from the current quarter, an alternative view of churn would suggest a rate that is closer to 6 percent.  </p><p>Be that as it may, to keep subscriber totals growing faster than customers drop away, Sirius has gone the celebrity route, seducing the nation's best known - and most controversial - disk jockey, <person><nameText>Howard Stern, </nameText></person>to leave the Infinity Broadcasting radio network that had been distributing his show for years.  </p><p>At times in the past, Stern has been neck-and-neck with conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh as the most widely listened to personality on the radio.  </p><p>But Stern's audience has suffered as his irreverent and often offensive on-air comments have entangled him with the bombs-and-God bunch at the Federal Communications Commission, encouraging one station after the next to drop his show.  </p><p>In October 2004, Stern signed a five-year deal to begin broadcasting his show via Sirius once his contract with Infinity expired at the end of this year. But Stern is a smart man, and though he claimed to be migrating to Sirius because pay radio, like cable TV, is not regulated by the FCC, he also knew the risks were huge and that five years from now Sirius could be a career-ender, no different from spending five years in the anonymity of exile in Mongolia.  </p><p>So he succeeded in squeezing Sirius for a $100 million per year contract that is easily the most lucrative deal any entertainer has ever gotten, anywhere.  </p><p>Almost immediately thereafter, Stern's old boss at Infinity, Karmazin, who had recently been dumped from his post as second-in-command at Viacom Inc. by the conglomerate's chairman, Sumner Redstone, joined Sirius as well.  </p><p>Karmazin has held down so many top slots in the media over the years that to call him a living legend seems if anything an understatement - and certainly seems more appropriate than the other honorific by which he is also known: \"Mad Mel.\"  </p><p>Yet the size of the bet that Karmazin has placed on what amounts to the success of just one man is certainly startling. At $100 million a year, the cost of Stern's show will equal the entire current programming budget of the company, and nearly half its total operating budget - and all for one daily show in drive time, as well as some as-yet-undetermined programming on a second channel.  </p><p>If all this pays off, and Stern alone brings in the 1 million-plus listeners needed to move his show into the black, Karmazin will have cemented his reputation forever as a media world clairvoyant.  </p><p>BUT if it fails, well, let's just say that a long line of people in this town will be forming to punch Mad Mel in the nose because New York is the media capital of the planet, and every major media company in America has a stake in the successful outcome of Karmazin's gamble.  </p><p>Reason: the cost of technological innovation in the media space has been moving relentlessly in opposite directions for years, with every week heralding the arrival of some revolutionary - yet essentially cost-free - new new thing like \"voice over the Internet\" telephony to make any big tech investment a huge gamble and potential white elephant.  </p><p>For Sirius to fail now would simply raise the stakes higher for everyone. On the other hand, if you've got 20 bucks and a teenage son with nothing to do, why bother with pay radio when you can have him start a podcast business!  </p><p>---- </p><p>Getting Sirius </p><p>Sirius Satellite Radio boss Mel Karmazin (inset) is hoping high-priced <person><nameText>Howard Stern </nameText></person>will make satellite radio less of a crapshoot for investors.  </p><p>Subscribers  </p><p>Sept. 30, 2005: </p><p>Sirius: 700,000 </p><p>XM: 5,034,000 </p><p>Sources: XM, Forbes.com</p><p>Sirius: Friday\u2019s close: $7.28 (-5 cents) </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>-Mel Karmazin [DMI] -<person><nameText>Howard Stern </nameText></person>and girlfriend Beth Ostrovsky  [Anthony J.

By making a bid for TikTok, the Chinese-owned, hugely popular social platform, Nadella is shifting his attention to the consumer-ad space where Microsoft could attract the regulatory spotlight currently facing its rivals.</p><p> There's a big pile of ad revenue out there basically captured by Google<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>GOOGL</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, Amazon<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>AMZN</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, and Facebook,  says Jai Das, a managing director and cofounder at venture capital firm Sapphire Ventures.  This would be a way for Microsoft to access that. </p><p>Microsoft received the green light from the Trump administration on Monday to pursue an acquisition of TikTok s U.S. operations from its China-based parent company ByteDance, which had faced threats from the White House of being banned over national security concerns. More than 100 million people use TikTok to post short, and sometimes viral, videos that generate revenue with ads.</p><p>In a blog post Sunday, Microsoft said it would complete the prospective deal   which would also include TikTok s operations in Australia, Canada and New Zealand   by September 15, and would invite U.S.-based minority investors to participate. The company said it would address privacy concerns by committing to transferring all of TikTok s data to U.S.-based servers, and delete data from servers outside the country.\u00a0</p><p>The move has struck some observers as good business sense; it s proven popular with investors, too, as Microsoft shares closed Monday up $11.49, or 5.6%, adding more market capitalization to Microsoft s stock than the acquisition would cost the company.</p><p>But for TikTok to become a success story, Microsoft will need to pull off its largest, and most-scrutinized absorption of another business in its history   a history that, until Nadella, was spotty. Under then-CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, only to watch as the company lost attention to rival products from Apple<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>AAPL</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, Facebook and more recent businesses like Zoom. And in 2013, it acquired the failing mobile phone-maker Nokia for $7.6 billion, an investment that was essentially<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>written off</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. The company s Bing platform also had minimal success competing against Google s search engine.</p><p>Momentum changed when Nadella was appointed CEO in 2014, who focused first on buying up enterprise-facing assets. Microsoft<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>paid</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>$26 billion for LinkedIn in 2016, an acquisition considered successful, and GitHub, which was<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>acquired</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>in 2018 for $7.5 billion has served as a customer runway to Microsoft s cloud services business, Azure.\u00a0</p><p>TikTok represents a new challenge for Nadella as it potentially joins a consumer-facing portfolio that includes the Xbox gaming division, Surface tablets and Minecraft. Like the enterprise companies before it, TikTok would likely remain a siloed entity for a couple of years, says Soma Somasegar, a former vice president at Microsoft who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. Such a period of separation would also provide time for Microsoft to navigate any regulatory issues linked to separating TikTok from its Chinese owner, Somasegar says.</p><p>Beyond that, Somasegar says the platform could have future integration with Microsoft s other consumer-facing brands. For example, TikTok s ad business could be cross-promoted on Bing. And in gaming TikTok could provide complementary streaming services to Xbox s platform.\u00a0</p><p>If TikTok is successfully integrated, Microsoft would become established as the fourth major player in the online ad revenue business. Forecasts on TikTok s growth vary, but the company s U.S. operations are expected to generate close to $500 million in revenue in 2020, and about $1 billion in 2021, according to Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. With these metrics, Ives estimates that TikTok could become a $200 billion business in a couple of years. And Microsoft has the cash, Ives notes, with $136 billion in cash reserves today, and expectations of generating $39 billion in free cash flow for 2020.\u00a0</p><p>As Facebook, Google and Amazon joined Apple in testifying last week, Microsoft s absence was notable to industry watchers.

The potential acquisition \u2014 expected to be valued around $40 billion \u2014 would be Microsoft\u2019s largest, and riskiest, in a string of acquisitions made by Nadella, who has rewritten Microsoft\u2019s reputation for unsuccessful buys and focused on the enterprise space through pick-ups including LinkedIn and GitHub. By making a bid for TikTok, the Chinese-owned, hugely popular social platform, Nadella is shifting his attention to the consumer-ad space in a way that could ensure Microsoft gets invited to the next round of Congressional inquiries.    \u201cThere's a big pile of ad revenue out there basically captured by Google, Amazon, and Facebook,\u201d says Jai Das, a managing director and cofounder at venture capital firm Sapphire Ventures. \u201cThis would be a way for Microsoft to access that.\u201d     Microsoft received the green light from the Trump administration on Monday to pursue an acquisition of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations from its China-based parent company ByteDance, which had faced threats from the White House of being banned over national security concerns. More than 100 million people use TikTok to post short, and sometimes viral, videos that generate revenue with ads.    In a blog post Sunday, Microsoft said it would complete the prospective deal by September 15, and would invite U.S.-based minority investors to participate. The company said it would address privacy concerns by committing to transferring all of TikTok\u2019s data to U.S.-based servers, and delete data from servers outside the country.     The move has struck some observers as good business sense; it\u2019s proven popular with investors, too, as Microsoft shares closed Monday up $11.49, or 5.6%, adding more market capitalization to Microsoft\u2019s stock than the acquisition would cost the company.    But for TikTok to become a success story, Microsoft will need to pull off its largest, and most-scrutinized absorption of another business in its history \u2014 a history that, until Nadella, was spotty. Under then-CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, only to watch as the company lost attention to rival products from Apple, Facebook and more recent businesses like Zoom. And in 2013, it acquired the failing mobile phone-maker Nokia for $7.6 billion, an investment that was essentially written off . The company\u2019s Bing platform also had minimal success competing against Google\u2019s search engine.    Momentum changed when Nadella was appointed CEO in 2014, who focused first on buying up enterprise-facing assets. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn in 2016, an acquisition considered successful, and GitHub, which was acquired in 2018 for $7.5 billion has served as a customer runway to Microsoft\u2019s cloud services business, Azure.     TikTok represents a new challenge for Nadella as it potentially joins a consumer-facing portfolio that includes the Xbox gaming division, Surface tablets and Minecraft. Like the enterprise companies before it, TikTok would likely remain a siloed entity for a couple of years, says Soma Somasegur, a former vice president at Microsoft who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. Such a period of separation would also provide time for Microsoft to navigate any regulatory issues linked to separating TikTok from its Chinese owner, Somasegur says.    Beyond that, Somasegur says the platform could have future integration with Microsoft\u2019s other consumer-facing brands. For example, TikTok\u2019s ad business could be cross-promoted on Bing. And in gaming TikTok could provide complementary streaming services to Xbox\u2019s platform.     If TikTok is successfully integrated, Microsoft would become established as the fourth major player in the online ad revenue business. Forecasts on TikTok\u2019s growth vary, but the company\u2019s U.S. operations are expected to generate close to $500 million in revenue in 2020, and about $1 billion in 2021, according to Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. With these metrics, Ives estimates that TikTok could become a $200 billion business in a couple of years. And Microsoft has the cash, Ives notes, with $136 billion in cash reserves today, and expectations of generating $39 billion in free cash flow for 2020.     As Facebook, Google and Amazon joined Apple in testifying last week, Microsoft\u2019s absence was notable to industry watchers. Should it bring in TikTok to fast-track its competition with their consumer products, the acquisition will signal a push into a new phase of ambitions under Nadella to compete on more fronts. As the venture capitalist Das puts it: \u201cTikTok is a way to bring that DNA to the company.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42753989630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H8-VSD1-F07F-83JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In December 2018, it was revealed that Pegasus - NSO's hallmark spyware device - enabled the Saudis to close in on critic Khashoggi, ahead of his murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

This is FIRST MOVE and here's your need to know. Ready Steady IPO: It's Tuesday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE and it's a very special one today because FIRST MOVE is one years old today. Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday to the team. It feels like 10. Only one. Let's move on. Let me take you a look at what we're seeing as far as the U.S. markets are concerned, setting off our second year together with a bit of a soft performance here, not helped by weaker economic data from China following a pretty muted session from the United States yesterday too, though, I know the Dow did manage to rise, but a fourth straight session, all the action focused on the bond markets right now where prices continue to ease pulling back from multi-year highs.</p><p>Remember prices lower, yields push higher, maybe bit of nervousness ahead of upcoming Central Bank meetings. Will the European Central Bank disappoint? Will they announce more bond buying and please remember hopes for fresh stimulus have driven bond yields lower over the past few months. I can tell you though, European stocks looking pretty calm today.</p><p>It was a mixed close in Asia, too. The major news there though deflationary pressure, the data coming from China, particularly worth noting, if you're hoping for fresh stimulus from the Chinese, too. Wholesale prices suffering the sharpest drop in three years. Remember when demand weakens, businesses cut the costs of products to try and stimulate that demand.</p><p>An interesting signal of course, as tariffs have ratcheted higher, one of those spillover effects here though of weakened growth has been pressure on energy markets, pressure on oil. That has been a challenge, of course for OPEC and a challenge for Saudi Arabia to specifically and that's where we're going to kick off the drivers because Saudi Aramco CEO says an IPO will be coming quote \"very soon.\"</p><p>It follows the appointment of a new Oil Minister, of course, this weekend, John Defterios -- I've got it again. John Defterios joins us once again. And this is exactly what we were talking about yesterday. Do the changes that we've seen over the last few days, accelerate the timetable for the IPO? Can we say yes?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: I would say absolutely, yes. In fact, the narrative has changed dramatically in the last 48 hours since Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman has become the Minister of Energy. We went from being ready according to Amin Nasser to being ready very soon, as you suggested Julia.</p><p>Many added, \"that's the bottom line,\" very much like a businessman. We also know how important Riyadh is to their future listing. It was even alluded to the fact that will be their main market going forward. This is a safe bet, because it is the home field advantage. Here's our brief interchange and what was a gigantic scrum after his speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMIN NASSER, CEO, SAUDI ARAMCO: That's a shareholder decision we took when it comes to the listing. As I always say, you know the decision is with the shareholder from Aramco side, as I say, we always say we are ready for whatever the decision is, either to list locally, which is the going to be the primary listing is to list locally, but we are also ready also for listing outside -- in other exchanges.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, the other jurisdiction would be a Tokyo preference where there is less litigation?</p><p>NASSER: It's a shareholder decision not Aramco's.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Do you have a preference on that? Do you have a preference for that?</p><p>NASSER: We are ready as I said to list whatever the shareholder decide. We are prepared for different jurisdictions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:05:04]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: How's that for a scrum, Julia? I tell you, he wouldn't confirm, Tokyo but he didn't reject that. He had the opportunity to reject it, and Tokyo makes a lot of sense if you think about it because Japan is one of the largest customers alongside China for Saudi Aramco and a lot less risk when it comes to jurisdictions, when it comes to litigation on Wall Street or even in London for that matter.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Good work, John. I call that severe dedication there in the thick of it. Rumor has it though, that the new Oil Minister is not wasting any time, I believe the Russian Energy Minister already touched down in Saudi Arabia. What do we know about this?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Interesting that he decided to go to Saudi Arabia before coming to the JMCC, that's committee within OPEC. It is my understanding from very senior sources in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere that he went to Dhahran to the Eastern Province to visit his old friend, Khalid al-Falih first as a courtesy, which I thought was interesting, and then went on to the capital of Riyadh to see Prince Abdulaziz.</p><p>The signal here is it is a priority of the Alliance. Number two, we wonder if Prince Abdulaziz said, \"Look, Russia last month, you produced better than 11 million barrels. Come on down. So this Alliance actually works to prop up prices for our IPO going forward.\" How's that?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We like it. Good job, JD. No one messes with you there in the thick of it at scrum. John Defterios there. All right, let's move on to our next driver. WeWork's biggest investor, Softbank, pushing the company to shelve its IPO. That's according to report in \"The Financial Times.\" The valuation, it seems between potential private market and future public market seems to have halved just this year alone.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins me now. Uncomfortable. Everything about this has been uncomfortable from the moment we started talking about it. I'm not surprised by this reporting. What do you think, Paul?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I am not surprised either, Julia, because as you and I have talked about on the show before, WeWork is a bit of an odd duck. It's not a company that is the most exciting of tech firms out there. They are really just a real estate company that has a lot of glitzy cool features for the workers that are working at WeWork locations, but with that comes staggering losses.</p><p>WeWork lost nearly $2 billion last year, almost another $700 million in the first six months of this year, and we've seen now in the past couple of weeks, how Wall Street has cooled to all of these unicorns that have recently gone public in the past couple of years and are still unprofitable.</p><p>Snap is tumbling again, they got hit hard yesterday. Slack has really been crushed since they reported earnings, which weren't earnings in the past week. And then Uber and Lyft also are not doing well and Softbank has backed a lot of these companies, Uber and Slack are two big losers in the portfolio for Softbank.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, we're talking about an IPO here of $15 billion to $20 billion. They were raising money from the likes of Softbank with a valuation at $47 billion. Even if there weren't questions about the corporate structure here about the payments to the CEO, about what actually this company is doing ultimately, these kind of numbers are a fear factor here in addition to the ongoing losses that the company is making, I just - - I think everybody is looking at this thing going, \"We need a reality check here.\"</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly. And I think one issue that could be a problem for some of these companies is that they have been private for so long that they are already starting to mature and you're having the revenue growth starts to slow down, but they're still not profitable. That is a recipe for disaster on Wall Street at this point.</p><p>Investors clearly when you look at stocks that have done well this year, utilities have done well because their yield place investors are clamoring for safety and even within tech, say what you want about Apple and Facebook and Google and their Alphabet, even Amazon, their revenues are still growing at a decent clip and oh yeah, they're all profitable. And some of them are even paying dividends when you look at Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco, and other big tech companies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I'll tell you what? If they decide to shut off the IPO and go back to Softbank for more money, the terms are going to be a little bit different. What did you call them? An old duck?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I did. Quack, quack.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'll call them the lame duck. Quack, quack, lame duck here.</p><p>LA MONICA: Happy one year anniversary, by the way.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being part of it. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that. All right, let's move on. Apple is set to unveil a fresh lineup today, think new high end phones and software updates, but don't hold your breath for anything too radical here.</p><p>Samantha Kelly joins us from the event in California. Samantha, fantastic to have you with us. I can forgive them for not announcing any bold new phones. But where's the 5G phone because Samsung is already doing it? Why aren't Apple?</p><p>SAMANTHA KELLY, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR: Okay, exactly. So don't expect anything to radical no foldable phone, no 5G phone like you mentioned. But to your point. Yes, so Samsung has already announced two 5G phones, LG has a 5G phone out on the market. And there's sort of a few reasons behind this.</p><p>[09:10:17]</p><p>First, there's not a ton of user cases right now, especially in the U.S., the Dallas Cowboys Stadium and down in Texas, they're using sort of a customer experience. But there's not really any major use cases. Service across the U.S. is pretty spotty. It's pretty limited. It's only in a few cities. I've tried it out myself. And then sometimes on one block, it'll work; and the other, you turn the corner, and then it won't work. So it's still pretty spotty and working things out.</p><p>It's also really expensive. These devices are -- they start at $1,000.00 and this gives Apple a little bit of time to bring down the cost of the modems. And that's another reason why it's reportedly a reason why that they're waiting a little bit, too.</p><p>They were using Qualcomm modems, shifted over to Intel, now maybe back to Qualcomm. And so that reportedly put some delays in the mix, too. But I think for the most part, eventually, soon, everything will be set with 5G. But it's amazing when you think about 4G, how that gave us streaming Netflix and Uber and all these different technologies.</p><p>And now in the next year or so, that's when we'll start to see 5G really matter, but this will probably not be the year for 5G with Apple.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point, actually. I mean, why not wait a couple of years and not miss the current upgrade cycle? Perhaps there's a financial reason thereto. What's the likelihood then that there's more excitement surrounding things like the iPhone Watch, rather than the iPhones here and any additions that we see there? Talk to me about the upgrade there.</p><p>KELLY: Sure, so we're expecting about three new devices, the rumors that are trying, you know, that are kind of kicking around as far as the names go, could be the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, maybe an iPhone 11 Pro Max, maybe iPhone 11 R. So you know, we're not quite sure.</p><p>But the Pro name sort of hints at like a premium model. Some experts are saying that maybe we might see an Apple Pencil also, the higher end devices, I'm not quite sure we'll see that yet. But the devices are going to have larger look just like the old models. We might get some new colors, green and purple are in the mix, maybe a matte finish, but it'll largely look the same.</p><p>However, this year will mostly be all about the camera. So expect to have three different cameras on the back sort of in a square light fixture and a lot of new software to kind of complement that as well.</p><p>Another thing that a lot of people were buzzing about was reverse wireless charging. So you could have an iPhone and you could put another iPhone on top of to charge or you could charge your air pods, but late last night, there were reports coming out that maybe they squashed plans for that, so we don't know, we'll wait and see soon.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, the charging technology sounds fantastic. I'm looking forward to that. Samantha Kelly, thank you so much for giving us that preview there. All right. Let me bring you up to speed with some of the other stories that we're following around the world.</p><p>One week after returning from summer break, the British Parliament is now suspended for five weeks by order if the government its longest suspension since World War II. Some lawmakers protested as the House of Commons was closed chanting \"shame\" and holding signs with the word \"silenced.\" It follows a series of defeats over Brexit for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has called for a snap election in October was defeated in the Commons for a second time last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: They have now twice denied the British people their say in the election. The House cannot choose, it will not let anyone else choose, Mr. Speaker. It resolved only to be resolute, decides only to be undecided, determined to dill adamant for a drift.</p><p>And, so now, the House will move to adjourn and resume the state opening in the Queen's Speech on October the 14th and I hope the opposition will use that time to reflect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, let's move on. The death toll in the Bahamas has risen to 50 as recovery efforts continue more than a week after Hurricane Dorian ravaged the islands. Nearly 5,000 people have fled since the Category 5 storm reduced parts of the Bahamas to ruins.</p><p>The Prime Minister is assuring evacuees they will be able to return home as communities begin to rebuild.</p><p>South Korea's military says North Korea has launched two unidentified projectiles just hours after Pyongyang said it was willing to resume nuclear talks with the United States later this month.</p><p>The two projectiles were launched east towards the sea. It's North Korea's 10th launch since May.</p><p>All right, so we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still ahead windows of opportunity. I speak to the president of Microsoft live on FIRST MOVE to talk about the future of the technology industry.</p><p>And there's nothing accidental about these billionaires. We hear from the author of the book that would become \"The Social Network\" to find out what the Winklevoss twins did next. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>[09:18:27]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Google is facing antitrust investigations in 48 of the 50 US states. This, after State Attorneys General joined forces on Monday. The probe will look into whether the tech giant abused its dominance harming consumers and competitors.</p><p>The announcement comes as more people are calling for a tighter regulation of technology. And that includes our next guest, who is Brad Smith, President of Microsoft. He's also co-author of a new book, \"Tools and Weapons: The promise and the Peril of the Digital Age.\" Fantastic to have you on the show, Brad, thanks for joining us.</p><p>BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Great book, loved it.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: \"Tools and Weapons,\" a perfect description of what technology I think represents to society. I want to start with the idea of regulation because as you'd sort of talk about in the book, Microsoft was at the forefront, perhaps of the first sort of backlash from society over that the dominance, the strength of technology, and it was a tough battle for Microsoft.</p><p>SMITH: We talk about it, honestly, I think candidly in the book. It was a tough experience for us. It was I think sort of technology's first collision with the world, so to speak. We had to adapt. We had to change. We, I think became older and wiser but we also found a new path. And I think in that path, there's an opportunity for all of us in tech. I think the whole industry is at a point where we need to mature to some degree.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When you said it was painful, Microsoft, though avoided being broken up which was what calls were at the time. I mean, that was what you were risking at that point. Do you think today is different? Is it better? Is it worse is it more likely that we again, see these cries for a breakup of some of the big tech giants here?</p><p>[09:20:13]</p><p>SMITH: I think the issues today are broader and deeper, and that's really what we try to address, my co-author, Carol Ann Brown in our book. It is issues like privacy and security and the impact of artificial intelligence on whether humans remain in control, whether our jobs change.</p><p>So when you think about the concerns that people have, they are so much more far reaching than the ones we had to address at Microsoft 20 years ago. But nonetheless, I think the fundamental lesson is the same. You have to take stock with other people's concerns and you have to take steps to address them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the conclusion of the book, and I don't want to spoil it is that the technology companies themselves have to be better at self- regulating, but governments need to move quicker and faster at keeping up with technology and understanding the implications, I think, of that technology.</p><p>One of the phrases that comes up a lot in the book, \"minimum viable regulation.\" What's that?</p><p>SMITH: Well, we tell this story about how software development is in fact, based on this concept of a minimum viable product. The notion is you may not have every feature that you will want in five years, but get a product produced, start selling it, learn from the real world and then add to it and make it better.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: And our basic point in something like facial recognition is we don't know all of the things that the law is going to need to address in five years. But we know some of the things it needs to address today, like steps to prevent bias and discrimination.</p><p>Rather than have governments debate this for five years, get something done and learn from the real world experiences.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're not going to be able to perfect this, you have to do something and then you can build on it in the future.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Act faster. Cyber security -- you've said this is the new battleground, cyberspace, ultimately, there's a brilliant story where you talk about Microsoft's battle with Russian hackers heading into the 2016 U.S. elections, it is important as we head into 2022. Is this a problem that we're on top of? Or do we have to accept that actually 2020 U.S. elections is still at risk here.</p><p>SMITH: I think there is a great deal at risk. I don't think we've yet grappled fully with everything that we now understand about, say the U.S. elections in 2016, or the French elections in 2017.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right. It's so much bigger than one.</p><p>SMITH: Exactly. And it's the weaponization of e-mail, with hacking of candidates, it is threats to voting systems, it is disinformation. So we still have to catch up with the problems that exist today. That's why we tell these stories behind the scenes about what has been unfolding.</p><p>But I also think we need to recognize the other side is not standing still. There is impressive, unfortunately, impressive innovation by hackers, by disinformation designers. And so with each step we take, we have to assume that the other side will respond.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There is also a brilliant story where you're looking at the United States and China, and you describe where you became peacemaker at Microsoft with Xi Jinping of China coming to the United States for a meeting with President Obama, a couple of months before, there's a huge hacking incident. And, and you kind of have to step into the breach here. What's ultimately resulted is what is being called a trade war. But it's a far bigger battle over technology. How is this war won, ultimately?</p><p>SMITH: It was one of the hardest chapters to write in the book, because I don't know that it is a war that either country can ever win, and I don't know that it's a war that the world wants one country or the other to win. The real question is how we create a stable peace. A peace that benefits both countries, but one of the points we make is that almost 80 percent of the people in the world don't live in either the United States or China, and we need a technology base in both countries that serves the world as well as the two respective populations. So it's very complicated, and we have to find our way through this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do other nations benefit if the United States and China are battling it out and attacking each other? Are others going to come up around the sides, or actually, is everybody going to be hurt by a sort of technology battle where the United States shuts out China, and the innovators in the United States can't use the sort of resources and the consumers that China represents here? Innovation suppressed as a result.</p><p>SMITH: I think that is the key point. One of the things we described is how software innovation is different from that in a lot of other industries.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: A lot of it happens at the basic research level, and even at the practical level, a lot of source code is published in open source form. If you buy a product that looks like it's from a German company or from an American company, it's probably in fact made around the world, not in the manufacturing sense alone, but in the development sense, because you have researchers and engineers literally working together on a global basis.</p><p>[09:25:21]</p><p>SMITH: So if somebody tries to create a new digital iron curtain, you're more likely to hold yourself back than somebody else.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I want to ask you as well about what we're seeing today in terms of valuations. Microsoft is an investor in in Softbank's Vision 2 Fund, a lot of questions being asked about a disconnect between the valuations that we see right now in the private markets for companies like WeWork, like Lyft, like Uber, versus what public investors are willing to acknowledge their value is, what do you see going on here?</p><p>SMITH: Well, look, I'm obviously not in a position to speak about any specific company, but I do think that we live in a world with quite varied business models. That's one of the fascinating things about tech. I mean, even among the established players, there are very different business models.</p><p>And I think that's what people are starting to learn more about, not just with the big tech companies, but with the new entrants. And you always have to ask, is the business model sustainable?</p><p>For many years, I think people felt that if a company could grow and add users, even if it didn't have a business model, it would get bought.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It would make money.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, and people said it's okay, one of the big tech companies will buy them. I think in the new antitrust environment in the U.S., Europe and globally, that might be a little bit different, and people are going to be under more pressure to have a sustainable business model earlier on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A reality check. One heck of one. Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft. Thank you so much.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's a great book. Recommendation coming from FIRST MOVE here. The market opens next. Stay with us. We are back in two.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE from the New York Stock Exchange. That was the opening bell this morning and as expected, yes, I can see we're seeing a bit of a spotty start to the trading session this morning, as you can see, under a bit of pressure here.</p><p>Investors eyeing higher bond yields. We were talking about this earlier on in the show. Ten-year Treasury yields bouncing from those multi-year lows. We're currently sitting what? Just above 1.64 percent. I call that a crawl high quite frankly. But there it is, rising yields, though helping trigger a rally in bank stocks in the session on Monday.</p><p>In fact, one of the strongest days for the bank stocks this year, Citi, the big winner up over four percent. Rising bond yields improve a bank's ability to make a profit fits hereto. So we will watch those in the session again today.</p><p>For now, let me walk you through our global movers early on in the session. Shares of Apple pretty much unchanged as you can see ahead of the big product launch today. The company is expected to unveil its latest iPhone today. It should have some new bells and whistles like more powerful cameras -- three in fact -- as we were hearing earlier on in the show. Also expected today, an update to the iPad and MacBook Pro and what it will charge for its new streaming service, too. So that's what is to watch for.</p><p>What about shares of Ford? They are lower again in the session some three and a half percent. Moody's lowered its credit rating on Ford to junk. The rating agency says Ford is likely to see continued weak earnings and cash flow as it continues to restructure.</p><p>Target shares also under pressure, about some three tenths of one percent. The company announced its holiday hiring plan in September, plans to hire some 130,000 seasonal workers higher than last year -- 120,000 was the number then, perhaps a bullish consumer side? Well, we will see. Right now, off some four tenths of one percent.</p><p>All right on to another asset class now. The ups and downs of cryptocurrencies have offered a unique opportunity to get rich quickly or potentially lose some money, too. Two entrepreneurs though that saw an opportunity early on and seized it are the Winklevoss twins. You may recognize them from a movie about the origins of Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM THE MOVIE \"THE SOCIAL NETWORK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer at the University.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This isn't petty larceny, this idea is potentially worth millions of dollars.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Millions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It might just be letting our imaginations run away with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The story of the Winklevoss twins and their origins of their feud with Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed, as you saw there in the movie, \"The Social Network.\" It was based on a book by Ben Mezrich. The twins allege Zuckerberg had stolen their idea for Facebook. They eventually settled for reported $65 million. And that money was then put to pretty good use.</p><p>In his next book, \"Bitcoin Billionaires,\" Ben Mezrich talks about what came next, and how Bitcoin offered the Winklevoss twins a way back into Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They had settled with Facebook, but then they kind of became pariahs in Silicon Valley as venture capitalists.</p><p>BEN MEZRICH, AUTHOR: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No one wanted their money.</p><p>MEZRICH: No one wanted their money. So they settled with Facebook for $65 million. They took it in stock. So it became $500 million, and then they decided they would become, you know, Silicon Valley investors. So they go out there, and no one would touch their money, because everyone's endgame is to sell their company to Zuckerberg.</p><p>So there's this crazy clique scenario going on in Silicon Valley, where if you're not in with the right people, you know, you can't sell your company. So they couldn't give their money away. They couldn't buy a cup of coffee in Silicon Valley, and they ended up going to Ibiza, as one does --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As you do.</p><p>MEZRICH: Right? You know, and they were partying on the beach at the club, one of the beach clubs there and someone walked up to them and said, \"Have you ever heard about Bitcoin?\" And that's kind of where their journey restarts.</p><p>So for me, it was really neat going back to characters who I had seen as one thing. ZYOU know, they were the bad guys. They were the guys in the skeleton costumes chasing the karate kid around the gym. They were the jocks, you know, and then seeing them in a totally different light now, not just because they made a billion dollars, but because they had the foresight to understand there was a revolution going on, when most people missed it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You talk about one specific incident in in the book, and it actually resonated with me, and that was what we saw in Cyprus during their financial crisis, and the bail-in of savers in Cyprus.</p><p>And I think everybody watching that was horrified for many different reasons that basically, nothing ultimately is safe in a worst case scenario.</p><p>MEZRICH: Right. I mean, you think if you put your money in the bank and it is in a bank account, and that's my money, but the reality is, it's not your money. It's money being held by a bank for you.</p><p>[09:35:06]</p><p>MEZRICH: So one day in Cyprus, when the country went bankrupt, the government said, the banks can now take your money and they took half of everyone's money. And all of these people started to realize there needs to be a safer way to store your value. It can't just be something the government can take tomorrow.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that resonated for them, too. They recognized that that perhaps was a great catalyst.</p><p>MEZRICH: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It fueled the rise.</p><p>MEZRICH: Well, the twins first of all, they had already been buying lots of Bitcoin. They had accumulated one percent of all Bitcoin.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>MEZRICH: That happened and they knew this really spoke to what they thought Bitcoin could be. You know, Bitcoin is that safe place because you don't have to trust people. You don't have to trust governments. You don't have to trust banks. You don't trust middlemen, you only trust math. And as boring as a math is, it's trustworthy. You know, it doesn't lie. And I think that that's what really turned them on.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The truth is, most traditional investors remain cautious about the benefits of investing in cryptocurrencies. Given how much time Ben spent with the twins, I asked him why he believes at this point, people are still questioning Bitcoin's legitimacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEZRICH: That's a lot of the reason why still big money waits on the side, why still institutions are a little scared of it, why my parents wouldn't buy Bitcoin, because they think of it as this world of drug dealers and gun runners and all of kind of this illicit stuff. And that's the battle that is inherent, it's going to go on, I think.</p><p>What is Bitcoin supposed to be? Is it going to be that? A libertarian paradise? Or is it going to be something we can all use? And I think you know, that's where the drama comes in. As an author, I'm looking for these Shakespearean dramas, and I think that's the drama of Bitcoin is what is it going to be?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Where are we along that path?</p><p>MEZRICH: Well, we're definitely -- yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Because this is key, too?</p><p>MEZRICH: Well, one of the big things had to happen, of course, is Facebook jumping in with Libra. The idea that something like Facebook, which is in all of our lives will suddenly have a form of crypto. And that changes the game, I think. It mainstreams it. It may not happen because we don't trust Facebook. We don't love Zuckerberg, for good reason. I think we're all scared of what Facebook might do with all the information they get.</p><p>But the idea of crypto is now here in a very big way. And so I do think the battle is being won by the Winklevoss twins, people who believe crypto will be part of our future and not just this battle, you know, not just this thing that brings down banks and governments but something that has to work in the system.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the twins have also said perhaps that they could be involved in Libra somewhere too, so we're going full circle in that relationship.</p><p>MEZRICH: Well, you know, listen, I think the twins' point of view in this is that \"Welcome to the party, Mr. Zuckerberg. If you need help, we're here to help you.\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Better late than never.</p><p>MEZRICH: Right. Because they're so far ahead of Zuckerberg in this world. They've been doing this for a while now. So I think in the end, this is positive for everybody and positive for the twins. So I could see them being involved in some way.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think they are amused by the fact that he is --</p><p>MEZRICH: Oh, they are absolutely amused. I mean, they really come back into town as billionaires, and suddenly Zuckerberg is looking at them again. The intertwining of these characters is really something unique.</p><p>Zuckerberg and the twins, I mean, the fact that they're back again, it's so bizarre, isn't it? I mean, why are these two groups of people suddenly coming together again, in this whole new revolution? So yes, they do find it amusing that Mark is back, and suddenly he is back in their lives. They can't quit him, you know.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Whether they'd like to or not. You raise an interesting point there, though, about the fact that we simply don't trust Facebook. They've been so many breaches. You threw something else out there actually behind the scenes, which was what if Amazon decided to do crypto because we haven't had the same kind of scandals surrounding Amazon and that has the same kind of breath here.</p><p>MEZRICH: Right. Well, the thing is, we trust Amazon, for better or worse. I love Amazon. I'm on Amazon all the time. And so is everybody. We all put our credit card information to Amazon without thinking twice, right? I mean, I remember the first time I did that, and I was scared; now, I do it five times a day.</p><p>And so the idea Amazon having a form of money, it doesn't seem strange to me because they are using my money all the time anyways. So I could see Amazon launching Libra and succeeding in a way that Facebook can't. Facebook has already proved us that they're not good with our data; that they're going to capitalize on our data. That's what they do. Amazon doesn't or if it does, it doesn't in a ways that haven't been thrown in our faces.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Bitcoin was invented more than a decade ago, in fact, but the cryptocurrency market itself still feels like it's in its infancy in many ways. Now, let's spin what's next -- how regulation can help and whether the U.S. will lead that going forward?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEZRICH: I think America has to decide soon where it stands on this because it would be sad to see us step back and allow this to explode in China or somewhere else. Bitcoin is here. It's not going anywhere. So you can either oppose it or you can get in with it. And I think in the end, it is very American, and America will get it with it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think unregulated, it poses a danger?</p><p>MEZRICH: I think it definitely ought to be regulated, at least the inroads and outroads to it. You don't want people getting onto a crypto exchange and having the exchange disappear tomorrow. And that's what's happened before, the idea of these exchanges being fly by night or not run out of the United States, or not having any sort of insurance to them. And I think that's scary. So there needs to be some form of regulation like any commodity to make it a fair playing field.</p><p>[09:40:25]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Gold, but better.</p><p>MEZRICH: Gold, but better. Digital gold. Yes, I really think it will be.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, would you be happy with your parents investing in it right now?</p><p>MEZRICH: You know that's a good question.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's where we started.</p><p>MEZRICH: Is that going to be money they were going to give to me? I actually do think that it has a very strong future. So I actually think, you know, I don't ever give advice on investments because everything I've ever bought has gone to zero. You know, I own Pets.com and WorldCom. And, you know, I'm the worst. Yes, I really do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow.</p><p>MEZRICH: But I do truly believe that there is a place for this in our future, and because the supply is so limited, you know, it has only one direction really to go if it stays around. And so I do think it's not a bad investment.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you don't own one right now?</p><p>MEZRICH: I don't own any Bitcoin. I mean, I don't own anything you know, like --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You leverage to the book.</p><p>MEZRICH: Right. I am highly leveraged in my own books.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I had to ask. Are you crazy for crypto yet? Well, worry not, there's more to come later this week. Tomorrow, I'll be speaking to the CEO of Ripple to help explain what their platform does and all about their cryptocurrency XRP.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break. But still ahead. The stuff of legends, the man behind Alibaba didn't need to say \"Open sesame\" to find his fortune. Now Jack Ma though standing down from the company that bears his name.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" It's a happy birthday and happy retirement for China's richest man. Jack Ma is officially stepping down as the Executive Chairman of e- commerce giant Alibaba. The 55-year-old will now focus on philanthropy and the work of his foundation. He says Bill and Melinda Gates were an inspiration to him. Ma spent two decades turning Alibaba into a business worth $460 billion. Wow.</p><p>In doing so, he pioneered online commerce within the Chinese market. But long before that, Ma, was an English teacher, one who would never lose his passion for education. FYI, September the 10th also happens to be Teacher's Day in China. How apt.</p><p>Now, the person Donald Trump calls Europe's Tax Lady will stay on as the E.U.'s Competition Chief. Margrethe Vestager is known for her record fines against Google, as well as demanding the island claw back taxes from Apple. She will stay in her position for another five years, part of the European Commission's newest lineup.</p><p>[09:45:50]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Volkswagen has unveiled a brand new electric car, the ID.3. It's roughly the size of a Golf on the outside but with a shorter foot and a larger passenger area. The German company says it wants to return to its roots by making fun cars like the iconic Beetle.</p><p>In the meantime, the shipping industry will soon face fresh regulations demanding its cuts down on fuel emissions. One company, Hurtigruten is already on its way introducing hybrid ships. John Defterios has more from Norway as part of \"The Global Energy Challenge.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TEXT: The Global Energy Challenge.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: On this edition of \"The Global Energy Challenge,\" we're in the fjords of Norway, exploring fuel innovations in the shipping industry.</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): In this part of the world, the sea for centuries has delivered a bounty from fisheries to oil to cruise tourism. But with big industry comes in impact on the environment. A cruise company, Hurtigruten has been trying to offset with a new fleet of hybrid ships.</p><p>The industry itself is going through a sea change with regulations coming in 2020, demanding shipping companies slash sulfur emissions from heavy fuel oil. But Hurtigruten is already ahead of the curve, transforming these engine rooms into a new hybrid system. Combining marine gas oil with electric battery packs, and even bio gas produced from organic waste from Norway's fisheries and forest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIEL SKJELDAM, CEO, HURTIGRUTEN: Our aim is to show that it's possible, that we can build the world's first hybrid powered cruise ship with batteries that we can be the first ones to start using bio gas from a circular economy and then we expect all other ones to pick it up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the battery racks where all the batteries go in. You throw them in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): Rune Andreassen is one of Hurtigruten'S most experienced Sea Captains, and has now been brought back on shore to project manage construction of the newest hybrid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (on camera): We didn't see a lot of change. And then people are saying look, climate change is a real threat. Shipping has a role.</p><p>RUNE ANDREASSEN, PROJEC MANAGER, HURTIGRUTEN: Yes, of course. Big role because there's a lot of vessels worldwide still burning heavy fuel. It's -- if you asked me 10 years ago, I will never say that this is possible at all. No ocean going West, it is nowhere here and I think it's just beginning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): While Hurtigruten has a relatively small fleet and smaller vessels than the giant cruise liners, some holding 10 times the passengers, the CEO is hoping his company will have a giant role influencing the industry with over a century of experience in these pristine waters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SKJELDAM: So we have chosen as a company to be in the forefront to lead and not wait for the regulations. And then the investors start requiring change, things will happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (on camera): The regulations were first announced four years ago, but reality is coming in January. More FIRST MOVE just ahead.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:50:54]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Today we're marking our first year of FIRST MOVE on CNN. It's been one wild ride for us, as well as the markets. Clare Sebastian joins us now. Clare, also wild ride for you personally, because right before we were set to launch, you broke your leg and weren't around. So I do have to mark that, too. We are very grateful that you're back.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I nearly tripped up on my way work, Julia. This is one thing to mark the occasion.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Just in memory of last year. All healed, though. But it has been, as you say a wild ride for the market. The S&amp;P 500 is now up about 3.7 percent compared to last year. But within that, as you can see, a lot of big swings driven largely by trade and monetary policy. And we've tallied up some of the things that have been moving the markets this year, Julia.</p><p>Have a look, we think about 3,600 Trump tweets that's based on the JPMorgan estimate of 10 tweets per day. That's actually probably a conservative estimate. I think he has been ramping up the tweets recently in an increasing number as we were discussing yesterday, are market moving.</p><p>We've got one trade war, unresolved. Hundreds of millions of tariffs have been implemented, still no resolution. The talks there continue. And of course, how could we forget, three rates changes, two up and one down with another probably set to follow this month.</p><p>So there's been a lot of change, a lot of moves, Julia. And a lot of ups and downs. You of course have been up and down the stairs at the New York Stock Exchange multiple times and you even climbed a Swiss mountain. So have a look Julia at some of your highlights from the last year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I am Julia Chatterley at the New York Stock Exchange, and this is CNN.</p><p>This is FIRST MOVE and here is today's need to know.</p><p>Where do you see the greatest opportunities at this moment?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The greatest opportunities around the world without doubt are still in the United States.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think we're still a bull market, an equity bull market?</p><p>ALAN GREENSPAN, FORMER U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHIEF: Not really. Now, we need to fumble. I can see it by reaction in recent days.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've had great earnings, a great response from investors as well. Can we say it's Cloud Nine or is that number not big enough?</p><p>GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM: Yes, you know that with any cloud.</p><p>PAUL KRUGMAN, AMERICAN ECONOMIST: I've been saying to my British friends, you know it's interesting, our bad guys are much worse than your bad guys. But you have no good guys.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We are live from Abingdon Green, outside of the Houses of Parliament here. Are you suggesting that the British people -- I think -- I think they were lied to, I think they were lied to by politicians. They were given false truths.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were not lies. No, they were not lies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think they were.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So I do think this was stupidity. I also voted in this election. I do think people are stupid.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will agree to disagree.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. I have an extraordinary guest joining us today. Hi, there.</p><p>ROBOT: Sorry. Could you say that again?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I just said hello.</p><p>This, I have to say is the most unusual guests we've ever had in the \"Chatt Room.\"</p><p>I spy -- an ice palace.</p><p>I'm not sure you would believe how comfortable and cozy this bed is. But all I can say is, it's like you know, lying on a cold cloud.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: It could be prophetic to go all the way on this.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: I don't agree with that. I think you're going to have the key for what we have. We have to disagree about something.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Go off set and disagree, please.</p><p>QUEST: The monetary policy, having gone like that, they're going to take a pause.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I had a conversation that said someone could actually cut -- they could bring rates down again in 2019.</p><p>TEXT: Good call, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Austerity, Richard, I blew the budget on the jumper.</p><p>QUEST: But he was rather good.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: She was brilliant.</p><p>QUEST: They will catch on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, I've definitely seen worse.</p><p>QUEST: I'm rather glad, they've gone.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>That just about wraps it up.</p><p>That's it for FIRST MOVE.</p><p>Time to go make yours.</p><p>Now, this is the way to exit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:55:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm trying not to cry. I'm waiting for a cake and flowers. I didn't even know what to say. Molly as well, David behind the scenes. But you saw their pictures there. We have such a great team here and I'm hugely proud and privileged of all the work that's gone into this.</p><p>So yes, I'm trying not to. I'm trying not to cry. What flavor is the cake, by the way? That's very important, too.</p><p>Clare, thank you so much, and for everyone that put that together. You know, I said earlier on the show one year down feels like 10. But somewhere in the middle, in a good way. Yes, here's too many more. I hope. Thank you so much for being part of it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I am raising a glass, Julia, with a FIRST MOVE mug. A very British cup of tea for you and I. A lot more to come in the next year or so, and election season, more China trade talks -- plenty more fun to be had.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh my goodness.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday, it is Monday, October 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now. Dow Industrials set to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">S&amp;P is also up a half percent. Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right now, up one percent. This is the high of the morning across the board. This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure. The Dow snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday. In Europe this morning, the trend continues upside. Markets are higher. FT-100 up almost a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p>CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher. And the DAX Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher. In Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout. Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.</p><p>Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action against the kingdom. This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their condolences.</p><p>Plus, caravan crisis. The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United States border is growing. It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on that caravan.</p><p>On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House investigators. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: These are very, very serious allegations. We know he's met with President Trump. President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two at the Department of Justice. But the Congress has oversight responsibilities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up. Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court as well. Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so far. 10 Dow components due to report their earnings. Plus technology giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets. They're coming out this week as well. On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third quarter. Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p>We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins. Good to see everybody this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE: Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for being here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: It's great to see the markets are up actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of tempered a little bit. The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their markets. So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500. So with those earnings coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate in the cloud.</p><p>So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin. Their cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Microsoft had a good quarter.</p><p>KELLY: And they pay great dividend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You know what though, we were expecting from the beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year. I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. In the earnings so far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up more than 25 percent --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>METAXAS: -- so far this quarter. And the trouble spot is that revenue is growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right? And then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.</p><p>KELLY: Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth. Look at what this economy is doing. If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it, I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25 percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree. I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking for any impact of these tariffs.</p><p>KELLY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: On the second quarter.</p><p>HIGGINS: We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is actually occurring.</p><p>KELLY: Correct.</p><p>HIGGINS: You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable lows particularly for blacks and others. It's -- it levels it has never been at. You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good backdrop.</p><p>HIGGINS: Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to hold the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We want to get to get to all of that coming up. And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week. The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting. It will be transcribed. This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p>He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE: A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this went on for a full year.</p><p>The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that. So we have questions for him about that. And we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent. Byron, thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this -- the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\" And in it, you outlined the revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his colleagues. Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p>And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a couple weeks.</p><p>YORK: Well, it does go away if Democrats win. I think there is no doubt about that. On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p>And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified setting. Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats. Just four guys and a court reporter and that's it. And it's going to be conducted in a skiff and a classified setting.</p><p>And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President, is that somehow classified? No, that is a matter of the highest public interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made public as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations. Should the Democrats take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B. For example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out there so that there could be accountability.</p><p>And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate he will continue these investigations. So we'll see, but I agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in small group of people top of the FBI.</p><p>YORK: Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to investigate the Trump-Russia matter. The Senate Intelligence Committee is doing that. The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this case. And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p>We know about the role that the dossier played. We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans. We know that the dossier was used in a very questionable FISA warrant. We know that FBI agents did not think Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on. And we only know those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President. They want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns. Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is pretty much over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And those will be the chairman that you mentioned, they're not certain yet.</p><p>YORK: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they would. Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi Arabia. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at a critical moment. This comes as Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p>The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?</p><p>ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA: There once people closely tied to him were involved in this operation. This was an operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: It's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority. He was clearly murdered in a consulate. Things like that don't happen in Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Byron, where does this go? I mean, it's pretty clear the King is keeping his son in power. He gave him more authority to reorganize the intelligence community. What do you think? Will the Crown Prince have to step down?</p><p>YORK: Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S. punitive action against Saudi Arabia. I mean. this is a complex story and there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk action in this. This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p>We're trying to find out what happens. The President has said that there will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder Khashoggi. And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he is being lied to in all this. He is making a lot of comments that are actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p>Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that is negative to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because you have to do something but then again there are only hope against Iran, right? I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia you talk about Iran.</p><p>HIGGINS: Oh, yes. And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911, funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen. So we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is figuring out what actually is punitive to them. Ending trade deals or arms deals does not do that. But for example, insisting that they expand oil production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be punitive, would be beneficial --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know that they have spoken about that.</p><p>HIGGINS: No. We have no idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If something --</p><p>HIGGINS: If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine, something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, Byron, on the border battle. The migrant caravan from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border. Where does this go?</p><p>YORK: Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it grow when it gets to the United States border? Does it even get to the United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons. The first and most important is the substance of the thing. If a large number of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in the precedent that sets.</p><p>The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is very, very bad for the United States. The other reason for the President is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters. And for the President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: These pictures are incredible. Byron, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>YORK: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron Work, Washington Examiner. Coming up. All eyes on earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so far. We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies coming up next.</p><p>And then from cars to drones. Uber rolls out a timeline for the food delivery service via drones. All the details next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are sure in countdown to the midterm elections. 15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the November contentious election. Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. They say politics can make strange bedfellows and will get yet another example later today. You remember it was just a couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted. Cruz fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial philanderer. Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin. However O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone. Then later today as well, we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend. The 44th President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th President will head on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of Illinois this week. This was part of President Trump's message over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats want to massively raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela. They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment taken away. Not a big point. That's not a good sound bite.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72 percent for Democrats. By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll.</p><p>However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting him underwater. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry?</p><p>HIGGINS: His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it's going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p>HIGGINS: Yes, those are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up. From the streets to the skies, Uber lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone. Got those details next. And then new FICO score could soon get a boost. Details on the new changes set to take effect. The new scoring system we've got them here, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A big week ahead. Lots of corporate earnings and big economic news. Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning with details there. Deidre, good morning.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That is right. Good morning, Maria. So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week. I'm going to go through the list. 3M, McDonald's, United Technologies, Caterpillar and Verizon. And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p>So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday. Just to let you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded expectancies. So, so far so good. We've heard from varying industries, one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning. Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p>We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia. So Halliburton, a special focal point this morning, Maria. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Deidre. Thanks very much. We could see a rally of about 100 right out of the gate. Deidre will follow that. A group of Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. This happened over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a Costa Rican guide in the Central American country. The victims were carried away downstream after their raft flipped over. Other people in other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p>The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor party. They were all from the Miami area we should say. Authorities say that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the river. That's where it happened.</p><p>Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year. FICO is going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market account. Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise. The Ultra FICO score has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal loans.</p><p>And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones. According to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial operations by 2021. However, Uber took the job posting down after an inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p>OK. The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year. Bankers say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria. At least with the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer. There is a positive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up. A crude awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are coming onboard. We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p>Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal exit of Britain from the E.U. U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are rallying this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110 points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter earnings. The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p>European trading similar story. Take a look at the markets in Europe right now. The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher. The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher. Asian markets closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board. Best performer, look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent.</p><p>The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran. Why one big name is saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel on crude right now.</p><p>All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an hour targeting trade. The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a deal. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been unsatisfactory, his word not mine. The U.S. and the U.K. also working to secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European Union. There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that meeting.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade. It is good to see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE: Nice to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's -- what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?</p><p>FOX: Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize our access to the E.U. market and make an access there to the U.K. market, but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of the world. The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10 to 15 years will be outside continental Europe. We obviously have to be free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement with the E.U. after we leave.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's, like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?</p><p>FOX: No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to have an independent trade policy. It's one of the main reasons that I campaigned and voted to leave. But we also have, other areas of contention too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland. We want to ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?</p><p>FOX: Access to the world's fifth biggest market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>FOX: And Germany's biggest trading partner. And we will be the biggest trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the European Union when we leave. So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to trade or investment that don't exist today. Why would we want to see tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this stance, right? Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U. Theresa May, is she committed?</p><p>FOX: We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year. The question is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like? And as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95 percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You said it very, very well -- very articulate. You're hosting International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that. What do you want to see with U.S.?</p><p>FOX: Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S. And it's our biggest single export market as a country. We have a trillion dollars invested in one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K. companies and vice versa every day. So, it's very important that we look at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions, what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs? How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues that we're discussing today?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S. I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?</p><p>FOX: Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move forward. This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter, we're second. If we can get liberalization there, fantastic. If can get a move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would be ground breaking globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening already for financial services companies? I mean, you know that businesses need certainty. And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out. I mean, the exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial services companies. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?</p><p>FOX: No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How?</p><p>FOX: Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase in the U.K. It was remarkable. London is still the number one metropolitan destination of the world for investment. And last year, in venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together. So, investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying economic fundamentals in the U.K.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very interesting and you make good point about the services part this. This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?</p><p>FOX: Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance, and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set the rules around global services? This our time. This is the time, when we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology. I mean, the President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?</p><p>FOX: In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private, all that analysis we share. Of course, we don't share the two-three-two mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K. we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military. And yet, we're not having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we disagree with, not the analysis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?</p><p>FOX: Well, they are sanctions on the European Union. So, when we leave the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States -- that becomes bilateral.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But has that been one of the talking points, has that been among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral deal with U.S. Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away on steel, right?</p><p>FOX: We won't want that, but, of course --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But have they indicated they would?</p><p>FOX: And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're members of the European Union under E.U. law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. OK, so that's the sticking point. When would you expect all of these deals to take place? You say the U.K. is going to be exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?</p><p>FOX: Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll obviously have that relationship in place. For the United States, we finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements. The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no taxes on any imports and exports. Is that something that you've discussed?</p><p>FOX: That would be a wonderful place to be. Why would we have any costs for our consumers that we didn't have to have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.</p><p>FOX: Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the automobiles. But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K. light trucks, we'd like to see that go. That is not just tariff, of course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade. Back in 2010, we were operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating 1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of U.K.-U.S. deal going forward? What should we be watching?</p><p>FOX: Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that will be the end of March next year. And at that point, we'll both set out what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another. We are in favor of general liberalization of trade. The U.K. is a very free trade in country. We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U. couldn't do, for example, on data movement. The E.U. has got restrictions on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?</p><p>FOX: Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't. One of three reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our money, control of our laws and control of our borders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of the European economy in all of this? Has it been uncertainty of it? Or how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?</p><p>FOX: See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for investments in the world, and the top in Europe. And unemployment rate just dropping below four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in the U.K.?</p><p>FOX: The reason why investors are still coming is that economic fundamentals are strong. There are a number of people who've never really come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our economy is performing so strongly. They told us that we'd see a half a million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the referendum.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess. Let me ask you about Saudi Arabia.</p><p>FOX: Fake prediction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fake prediction. You recently pulled out of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do that including, Fox. Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s relationship with the kingdom? What do you want to see in terms of the Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?</p><p>FOX: We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible investigation. We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government overnight about how this event happened. We want to verify that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?</p><p>FOX: Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports. But we want to make sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely with us, the United States, being the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, it's all about trade. In terms of --</p><p>FOX: In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security. How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security. So, let's make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate. But of course, we have to generate it first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you. Thanks so much. We'll be watching your international day of trade today. Liam Fox there.</p><p>News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency. Must change laws!\" That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed to the border of the U.S.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back, we're watching oil. Brent rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00 and change, what's driving this market. Then, 15 days until midterm elections. The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart Varney on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The economy under President Trump, the President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Did you see those jobs numbers? They come right from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular. That may account for the rise in the President's approval rating. In Florida, in the last 12 months, they've added 407,000 new jobs. In Texas, they've added 406,000 new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history for those two states. In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years. In Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.</p><p>I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a polling moving towards the President and the GOP. You just put up on the screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll, that's right up there. That's actually a little better than the performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same time in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the Republicans. Interesting stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at this point in the cycle. But will voters vote on that, Stu? Are they going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else? I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you. I think this caravan that's heading our way --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY: That is a new issue in this election. And I think it's very favorable towards President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them, essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and, yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show. We're going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: I do. Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the looming Iran sanctions. They're going to hit in the next two weeks. Oil now just below $80.00 a barrel. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" The President goes on to say, \"Remember the midterms. So unfair to those who come in legally.\" \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes, \"remember the midterms. Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the President.</p><p>I want to take a closer look at oil this morning. Oil has been creeping up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet Oil just under 70 this morning. We are now two weeks away from implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports. Meanwhile, a recent report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks. Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork. Stephen, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT: Great to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks. Your view.</p><p>SCHORK: Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria. We've had a summer where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer, again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals. Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20 percent rise in oil.</p><p>Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the Iranian sanctions go into effect. The November contract today in WTI expires today. The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>SCHORK: We've had five months to digest this Iranian news. This Iranian news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s. We're now correcting that bubble and now we're in the high 60s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here's Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS: Yes. So, my question is there was some internal report that was released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production, and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p>SCHORK: Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American, United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran. That's not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going lower. We will check back.</p><p>SCHORK: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stephen Schork joining us there. We've got final thoughts when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great show, everybody. Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. You heard it from Dagen McDowell. Seize the day! Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: Seize the day? Seize the new week, why not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY: Good morning, everyone. It's going to be a very big week for --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p>CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.

This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad  bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their  condolences.  </p><p>Plus, caravan crisis.  The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United  States border is growing.  It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on  that caravan.</p><p>On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol  Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House  investigators.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p>We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p>So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p>KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p>HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p>He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p>The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p>And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p>And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p>And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p>And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p>We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p>YORK:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p>The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p>ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p>YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p>We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p>Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p>HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p>YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p>The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p>And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p>However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p>So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p>We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p>The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p>Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p>And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p>OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p>Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p>European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p>The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p>All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p>FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p>FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p>FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p>FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p>FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p>FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p>FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p>FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p>FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p>FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p>FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p>News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.   Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.  I have alerted  Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency.  Must change  laws!\"  That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed  to the border of the U.S.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, we're watching oil.  Brent  rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00  and change, what's driving this market.  Then, 15 days until midterm  elections.  The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart  Varney on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The economy under President Trump, the  President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections  according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p>I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p>I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p>Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p>SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Many of the worst actors were big banks.</p><p>So it\u2019s not just Big Tech that needs the equivalent of trust busting \\x97 something I proposed in a column a year ago.</p><p>Health-care companies, banks, airlines, railroads, media companies, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Telecom and more are too big and stifle competition, innovation, job creation, wages and customer choice. The share of young companies has been declining in America.</p><p>Yet Warren chose Big Tech rather than the areas where she has the most expertise. One can assume she\u2019s trying to get ahead of a left-moving Democratic Party at a time when pro mi nent technology giants are in bad odor.</p><p>In a Medium column where she fleshed out her ideas, she wrote, \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \\x97 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted</p><p>the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\u201d</p><p>Paradoxically, however, she nearly undermines her argument by claiming that the Microsoft antitrust action in the 1990s helped clear a path for internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.</p><p>Well, maybe. But Microsoft is bigger and healthier than ever, and the \u201csuccesses\u201d she cites are now giant corporations she says need breaking up themselves. So perhaps the Microsoft lawsuit cleared a path, but the fundamental problem of bigness remains.</p><p>Like the Green New Deal and raising top marginal tax rates on the rich, breaking up Big Tech is an idea in motion, the start of a conversation. But it has political appeal beyond the left, as Big Tech\u2019s reputation has taken a big slide in a new Harris Poll.</p><p>And like the other proposals, it stands little chance of becoming law anytime soon because of the red-state lock on the Senate. Presidents alone can\u2019t make this happen, but they can appoint regulators \\x97 no small thing.</p><p>The late 19th century\u2019s Gilded Age was characterized by monopolies and cartels, as well as high inequality, protected by the political power of the wealthy. It didn\u2019t last, giving birth to the Progressive era, with antitrust and regulation reining in the worst abuses.</p><p>This tough stance continued through much of the 20th century, with an exclamation point being the 1982 breakup of the Bell System.</p><p>But big business and conservative intellectuals began fighting back in the 1970s. Especially influential was Robert Bork, more widely known for his failed nomination to the Supreme Court. Bork\u2019s most consequential achievement was dramatically redefining antitrust laws.</p><p>Instead of protecting smaller businesses and ensuring competition, antitrust laws should encourage economic efficiency, Bork argued. This revolutionary interpretation gradually took hold in the federal courts until it was the standard by which mergers and company size were judged. Or given a pass. The Bell System essentially reconstituted itself in recent years.</p><p>Especially since the 1980s, critical sectors of the economy have been taken over by cartels and semi-monopolies with unbeatable pricing power along the supply chain.</p><p>Not just the courts backed lax antitrust. It was supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as deregulation such as the Glass-Steagall Act. The big banks brought on the Great Recession \\x97 the best argument yet against bigness \\x97 yet they came out of the crisis even bigger.</p><p>As a result, Warren and the Democratic left would have to win many elections and gain a Supreme Court majority before a new era of trust busting could get underway. It\u2019s a rough ride that Theodore Roosevelt never faced.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>analysis</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>In running for president, Sen.

Right now, rich CEOs are not, boards that have horrible governance are not you have to wash these people out.' The interviewer taken aback, Palihapitiya concluded by reiterating, 'Just to be clear on who we're talking about. We're talking about a hedge fund that serves a bunch of billionaire family offices, who cares?</p><p> They don't get the summer in the Hamptons?'The fear that the politicians the ultra-rich had purchased wouldn't return on the investment was a sharp divergence from the 2008 financial crisis, where they were 'too big to fail.' Palihapitiya exposed the virus infecting the heart of American capitalism: the duality of an economy with an unemployment rate nearing 15 percent while a cabal of billionaires adds $485 billion to their net worth. The pandemic should reveal to 'free market' advocates that the invisible hand is attached to a corporate arm, with a clutch on market rules like bankruptcy to benefit the elite.This will change. Robert Reich's Saving Capitalism elucidates how to prevent pre-distribution of wealth during the pandemic. The central tenet of Reich's work reveals that 'the market is a human creation.' A truly free market depends on a democratic economy with countervailing power from the people. In this essay, I'll examine the rules Reich proposes and how they can be rewritten to not just save capitalism amidst the pandemic, but vaccinate it against future outbreaks of greed.Reich analyzes the foundations of capitalism: property, monopoly, contracts, bankruptcy, and enforcement. Reich details how corporations abuse intellectual property, using the example of vaccines. While products from nature once could not be patented, 'in the 1990s, the rules changed. Pharmaceutical companies were allowed to patent the processes they used to manufacture vaccines and other products from nature.' Additionally, the use of pay-for-delay agreements has prevented cheap alternatives, with approval from the government. 'In 2012, Congress authorized U.S. customs to destroy [generic alternatives].' If a pharmaceutical company patents the COVID-19 vaccine, they could exploit the vaccine for profit. This hypothetical demonstrates why we must democratize market rules to revitalize competitiveness within the market of intellectual property.Modern monopolies have frightening implications. 'A handful of giant corporations are reaping the rewards of network effects. The larger their networks become, the more data they collect, and therefore the more effective and powerful they become.' Amazon presents the perfect example, as Reich describes anti-competitive practices contributing to a cycle wherein 'as Amazon's economic power increases, so does its political clout.' These monopolies use their clout to annihilate competitors. As Reich notes, 'Unlike the old monopolists, who controlled production, the new monopolists control networks the new monopolists have enough power to keep antitrust at bay.' What happens when consumers are trapped at home, and one company has 'become the first stop for almost a third of all American consumers looking to buy anything'? A startling headline recently heralded Jeff Bezos as the first trillionaire. This is anathema to the millions of Americans unemployed by the pandemic, but can be prevented if the government enforces antitrust.As the pandemic began, U.S. senators dumped stocks using advance knowledge about the severity of the recession. Reich details how contracts based on confidential information have created a system whereby the average consumer is unable to compete against the upper class because of their access to this 'coin of the realm.' An empowered government would be able to regulate Wall Street by punishing insider trading. Rules on contracts must also protect workers from exploitation, such as contracts forcing worker attendance during a pandemic.Echoing Palihapitiya's argument, Reich uses the airline industry to demonstrate the failure of bankruptcy rules. 'Over the last two decades, every major U.S. airline has been through bankruptcy at least once, usually in order to renege on previously agreed-upon labor union contracts.' The rules of bankruptcy, coinciding with the promise of being bailed out by the government, have allowed corporations to exploit bankruptcy to fail their workers. What will happen to employees as corporations file for bankruptcy amidst the COVID-19 recession?The final pillar of capitalism, the enforcement mechanism, is the source of reform. The government is uniquely able to enforce the regulation of corporations. Unfortunately, 'wealthy individuals and corporations that can afford experienced litigators have a permanent, systemic advantage.' This ability to exert influence over the enforcement process has been exposed by the pandemic, as corporations robbed the Paycheck Protection Program with impunity. Reich affirms that 'Wall Street has blanketed America in a miasma of cynicism.' This apathy has allowed corporations to continue pushing their candidates into office, who serve as what Reich dubs their 'friendly congressional patrons' who write the rules. A government empowered by the people would democratically rewrite these rules, holding corporations accountable.But the pandemic has exposed that corporate wings of political parties aren't working. Reich cites a prominent study by professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page, concluding that 'the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule impact upon public policy.' This has manifested deep cynicism as both parties squabble over stimulus checks while bailing out big business. As Reich describes in his proposed set of reforms, one catalyst for change would 'reform the nation's system of campaign finance in order to get big money out of politics. That would require that the Supreme Court's decisions in Citizens United and McCutcheon be reversed.'We can't rewrite the rules before expunging the 'congressional patrons' from office. Countervailing power for the democratically represented American citizen would 'end the upward pre-distributions currently embedded in market rules' that enable corporations to odiously increase their power during this pandemic. By reforming the pillars of capitalism and democracy, we can safeguard against future inequality. Take the hypothetical vaccine creation as an example; Reich stipulates reforms to the rules of property, stating that 'the lengths of patent and copyright protection would be shortened and pay-for-delay agreements banned.' The 'free market' has written the rules to make restricted access to a lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine inevitable, so the government must step in to make the rules fairer not just to save capitalism, but to save lives.As for breaking up Big Tech monopolies that have abused anti-competitive market rules, Reich theorizes that, under a rewrite of the rules of the market, 'antitrust would be returned to its original purpose, not only achieving market efficiency and maximizing consumer welfare but also reducing the political influence of large aggregates of economic power.' Contract law would be rewritten to prohibit 'all stock trades based on information unavailable to the general public,' thereby banning insider trading and preventing both elected officials and Wall Street from making profit at the expense of an efficient market and consumers. 'Bankruptcy law would give labor agreements a higher priority,' which will prove essential as businesses continue to file for bankruptcy, leaving their workers nothing.As these businesses request bailouts, we must heed Palihapitiya: Companies that pour money into stock buybacks shouldn't be bailed out. Reich notes that 'not only do stock buybacks enrich CEOs at the expense of smaller investors, they also drain away money the corporation might otherwise spend on research and development.' Stock buybacks have become a tool for wealth expansion at the expense of economic sustainability, and corporations suffering right now because of their investment in stock buybacks should not be bailed out without restructuring to prevent the proliferation of this wasteful manipulation.Reich's contention that 'instead of directly taxing the current income of a few and transferring it to the many, a more sensible approach is to more widely share future wealth' may not be enough in a post-pandemic world where the wealthy have exponentially enriched themselves. This is illustrated by the game Professor Reich instructs his students to play, detailed in the book. Rather than accept less money, students (and the majority of Americans) must demonstrate their unwillingness to accept less than what's fair, and quit the game if the rules aren't changed immediately. The students 'worry that if their partner ends up with more of the money, he'll also end up with far more power, which will rig the game even more.' The end of the pandemic must not lead to an even further rigged game. We must heed Reich's words: 'If America's distributional game continues to create a few big winners and many who consider themselves losers by comparison, the losers will try to stop the game out of a deep-seated sense of unfairness and a fear of unchecked power and privilege.'Other reforms, from increasing the minimum wage to investing in public education, all stem from the reclamation of the enforcement mechanism, as politicians take back their power to set fair rules of the game derived from democratically distributed political power. If the election of political leaders who rebuke the tether of corporate interest isn't implemented first, the congressional patrons will continue to rig the game. We return to Chamath Palihapitiya's treatise: Perhaps this pandemic, in exposing the failures of capitalism, serves as the perfect opportunity to extirpate the congressional patrons and the boards they bail out. If we don't act, our nation has a lot more to lose than a summer in the Hamptons. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TPPD102301160047004526875776100146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TPPD-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W4-0NM1-JCMN-Y362-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1717\"/><timeReceived>11:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The American Prospect Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 18, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2A8</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000166</classCode><className>INSOLVENCY &amp;

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna, D-Calif, said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p>\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit</p><p>$59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as littie as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions... or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas' book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas' ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won... maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a Linkedln co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, California, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his gray suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' \"</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.</p><p>\"That's OK,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders' revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find.</p><p>-THE WASHINGTON POST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2231824969</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">25301ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W83-WSJ1-DYR7-80J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3110\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 News - India Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>News India - Times</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 10710248</issn><volume>Vol. 50</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Front Page/Cover Story</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Harvard Business School</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Silicon Valley-California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Khanna, Ro</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Students</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Capitalism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anger</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political campaigns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Inequality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congressional elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gross Domestic Product--GDP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High tech industries</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 611310</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A1SO</classCode><className>BUSINESS EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

It spent billions to bolster defense. It formed new federal agencies. It declared war on terrorism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime, more than 100 times that many people have died from medical errors -- with little public outcry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's time for that to change, say developers of medical technology.</p><p>\"We need a march on Washington of a couple million people to press upon the government that we have this crisis,\" said Harvey Wagner, CEO of Quovadx, which sells software to hospitals for managing patient care. \"We need to get health care into the 21st century.\"</p><p>The medical sector is one of the last holdouts of the computer age.</p><p>Years after their patients embraced databases, word processors and digital cameras, many doctors' offices are stuck in the 1950s.</p><p>They keep paper records. They scribble prescriptions on paper. They develop X-rays on film and mail them out to other doctors.</p><p>The result: climbing health care costs and needless mistakes.</p><p>A new era may be dawning. Alarmed by costs and failing care, the government and insurers are pushing for business upgrades.</p><p>Human error, paperwork and archaic bookkeeping might be partly to blame for the health care system's $1.65 trillion yearly price tag. That's 15% of the country's gross domestic product.</p><p>President Bush has said he wants most Americans to have an electronic medical record within the next decade.</p><p>Investors see the shift as a big opportunity. Witness the 40% jump in companies in Investor's Business Daily's Medical Software group over the last 12 months.</p><p>1. Business</p><p>Selling medical software is a lot like hawking any software. Only in this case, the audience is smaller and the stakes are higher.</p><p>No doubt, a glitch in Microsoft Word is irksome. But bad drug combos, unclear digital scans and lost medical records are matters of life and death.</p><p>Technology glitches mean money down the drain, too. Last December, Neurocrine Biosciences' insomnia drug indiplon suffered a delayed OK from the Food and Drug Administration. The culprit was a formatting error in its electronic application.</p><p>Companies in IBD's medical software industry group are a diverse lot. Their technology falls into one or more of six categories:</p><p>** Electronic record keeping. These systems store patient records and transmit selected parts to other doctors and insurers.</p><p>** Clinical information systems. These help hospitals and doctors manage the business. They can include things like work schedules and billing.</p><p>** Medical imaging. These systems replace film-based pictures, such as X-rays, with digital scans.</p><p>** Pharmacy information systems. These make it easier to send prescriptions and check for harmful drug interactions.</p><p>** Laboratory management. This helps labs conduct testing and track results.</p><p>** Integration. These are the services and software that help all the other things work together.</p><p>The industry can be hard to classify, analysts say.</p><p>\"It's a bit of a mix between health care and technology,\" said John Farrell, a buy-side analyst with National City's Private Client Group. \"It doesn't fit into a typical tech guru space, and it doesn't really fit into health care.\"</p><p>Most of the companies, especially this year's best-performing ones, are small-cap firms.</p><p>\"Innovative technology seems to come out of smaller companies that are very agile,\" said Creative Computer Applications CEO Steven Besbeck. \"We're able to do things without dragging along the bureaucracy that large companies have. Most of the big companies have gotten into these businesses by acquiring smaller companies.\"</p><p>The industry's bigger companies include GE Medical, IDX Systems, Cerner and Allscripts Health Care Solutions.</p><p>Tech giants such as IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems also sell to the health care field.</p><p>Like other software companies, medical software firms spend much of their time and energy on development.</p><p>Production and distribution costs are low. But the segment's newness makes sales and marketing especially important.</p><p>** Name Of The Game: Cash in on the growing push to upgrade health care by bridging technology and medicine.</p><p>2. Market</p><p>The segment has a small pool of customers. That might help explain why few big tech firms make software focused on health care.</p><p>Customers include about 6,500 hospitals, 300,000 medical specialists and 1.5 million general practitioners. That's a fraction of the potential customer base of, say, Microsoft Office or Quicken.</p><p>Hospitals, with their economies of scale, have been the most eager adopters.</p><p>But more health care is delivered on an outpatient basis. That's drawing smaller medical groups and even small offices into the act.</p><p>These groups and individual doctors represent the biggest piece of the market.</p><p>With limited cash, they're also the last to adopt such technology. That makes them among the hardest to sell to.</p><p>A mix of factors is driving demand.</p><p>Most customers hope the technology will save them money and improve care. But pressure from government and insurers is probably a bigger factor.</p><p>Health care technology spending will reach nearly $22 billion in 2008, says Scott Tiazkun, an analyst at International Data Corp.</p><p>Software is expected to make up $8.9 billion of that, more than hardware or services.</p><p>\"Ongoing national health care initiatives and government focus on health issues lead many vendors to think that the good times for health care IT (information technology) are just starting,\" he wrote in a recent report.</p><p>3. Climate</p><p>A major source of the industry's optimism: regulation. Medicare and Medicaid now expect providers to document with electronic codes how they treat patients.</p><p>Add to that the data exchange standards set forth by 1996's Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The law came into full effect only last year.</p><p>And a two-year program called Doctors' Office Quality Information Technology is pushing for digital medical records. It's aimed at small and midsize doctors' offices.</p><p>Many private insurers are following the government's lead. They're also tweaking the way they pay doctors.</p><p>For years, insurers have paid per procedure. The more tests and treatments the doctors perform, they more they're paid.</p><p>That's hardly an incentive to be more efficient. Now patient outcomes and quality of care are playing a bigger part in the equation.</p><p>4. Technology</p><p>Hospitals and doctors offices are just starting to use technology that is taken for granted in other sectors.</p><p>Picture archiving and communication systems, known as PACS, are making it easier to see and share medical scans such as sonograms. They are to old-fashioned X-rays what digital cameras are to film.</p><p>They make it possible for doctors to check scans right away or for far-flung specialists to help interpret them.</p><p>A range of standards is making it easier for computer systems to work together. Electronic drug prescriptions could cut errors caused by a doctor's sloppy writing or catch harmful drug combos before they happen.</p><p>Case in point: Evanston Northwestern Healthcare warned affected patients just hours after Merck recalled arthritis drug Vioxx last year. A digital records system made this almost easy.</p><p>5. Outlook</p><p>With the federal government pushing for a health care makeover, medical software firms see no way but up.</p><p>That doesn't mean everyone will be a winner. Doctors aren't tech gurus. Many might do a poor job of choosing the right systems for the job. That might lead to a backlash.</p><p>\"There will be a lot of people burned and a lot of money wasted,\" said Sami Aita, CEO of MedcomSoft.</p><p>Even so, he remains upbeat. Demand will far outstrip his industry's ability to get systems up and running, he says. The industry will need to partner with better-known tech companies such as IBM and HP.</p><p>Many companies likely will get bought by bigger firms looking to sell a broader range of offerings.</p><p>The ability of these systems to talk to one another also will be key. Without a set of widely used standards, the industry won't live up to its promise.</p><p>** Upside: The quest to upgrade could create a gold rush for investors. Some medical software companies will make good buyout targets for bigger tech firms.</p><p>** Risks: Gold rushes never last long. In the wake of the dot-com bust, buyers want to see a quick return on their tech spending. Some firms might promise more than they can deliver. The segment is filled with small firms, which can prove risky investments.</p><p>Another downside is that Wall Street isn't paying much notice to the segment, says PCG's Farrell. Analysts haven't decided which is better: a medical company with technology know-how, or a strong tech firm that knows health care.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-1229826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4G00-WXD0-01J8-W3WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1440\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. \u00a0  www.investors.com</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>April 18, 2005 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>HEALTHVISION INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0NEUROCRINE BIOSCIENCES INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>\u00a0CLINICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NBIX (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0SIC2836 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS, EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>IDXC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

From the anchoring role in society of the middle class to the agility and resilience of mid-size firms, the middle was seen as consistent with both individual and collective wellbeing. Yet, in recent years, the middle has become less stable, less predictable, and more elusive, and its primacy - in economics, politics, business, asset management, and even sports - has become increasingly unsustainable.</p><p><br/>Driven by structural changes, as well as lagging business and policy responses, the middle has been eroded - or is at risk - almost everywhere you look. Should this trend continue - which is subject to some debate - the implications would be far-reaching.<br/>For decades, a rising median household income in advanced economies anchored the growth of a middle class that often opted for the political center. Together with stable and trusted institutions, the middle class acted as a stabilizer for a more prosperous society. In business, too, an environment in which mid-size firms flourished was viewed as desirable, because it reconciled small firms' lack of balance-sheet strength with their larger counterparts' tendency to slip into oligopolistic complacency.<br/>But median incomes have stagnated, which, combined with the impact of technology and insufficient policy attention to the potential distributional effects of unfettered globalization, has gradually hollowed out the middle class around the world. As a result, both the hope and reality of a satisfying middle-class life, with its potential for upward social mobility, are in decline.<br/>In addition to weakening an important social stabilizing force, the diminution of the middle class has fueled the politics of anger and undermined the political center, hitherto dominated by established parties. As polarization and fragmentation have increased, bipartisan policies have become a lot more difficult to pursue.<br/>This trend is also reflected in declining public trust in expert opinion and established institutions. And all this has supported the growth of more extreme political parties and/or anti-establishment movements.<br/>The middle is also proving less friendly and stable for business. In sector after sector, mid-size companies face greater competition from small disruptors and/or their large counterparts. This includes the financial sector, where higher regulatory and compliance costs have eaten away at the sustainability of mid-size providers. This is visible in the number of mergers among mid-size asset managers that lack a strong corporate parent.<br/>Sports, too, is losing its middle. In the absence of forced equalization mechanisms (such as those used in the United States' National Football League), European soccer is now dominated by a handful of teams that have become business behemoths.<br/>This last example also sheds light on important questions concerning what lies ahead. Is the erosion of the middle really inevitable? Are we in the midst of what economists call 'multiple equilibria, in which one unfavorable shift makes another, even worse, shift more probable? Or will a mix of natural mean reversion and responsive policies restore the soundness and benefits of the center?<br/>Given the rapid changes in technology and political disruptions, it is hard to know what lies ahead. But there seem to be enough indicators to suggest that, in certain areas, a strong middle can indeed be reclaimed if policies adapt quickly enough. That is probably the case when it comes to economic policies, where there is at last greater recognition of the importance of structural changes and distributional effects.<br/>For example, economists are beginning to resist the inclination to rely on too many simplifying assumptions that facilitate modeling but are removed from reality. They are also beginning to redress the inadequate inclusion of financial linkages and insights from behavioral science, as well as overemphasis on single equilibrium conditions. And they are deepening their understanding of accelerating structural changes associated with technology, the impact of China and other emerging economies, and the politics of anger.<br/>The more these changes feed into better policies, the greater the potential for political parties to present more compelling agendas, especially if they are presented by more engaging leaders.<br/>The decline of the middle in business is also likely to result in some pushback, though the impact will differ significantly by industry and will be continuously challenged by structural headwinds. It is more likely to occur in some industries, such as big tech, where a regulatory response will probably be one outcome of a developing backlash, and less likely for asset management.<br/>These developments have the potential to slow what, for now, has been a self-reinforcing migration away from the middle. But restoring faith in the feasibility and desirability of the middle - belief that the middle is strong enough to promote stability and prosperity - will take time, and sustained effort. And that loss of faith, compounded by accelerating technological change and the fragmentation of international order, goes a long way toward explaining why the future seems less predictable, and why the average person feels more unsettled.

And still with around the table is Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.  </p><p>      Savita, big conversation here in New York because I'm sure you know about whether we are late cycle, mid cycle, whatever cycle. Where are we in this cycle?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  Yes, it's been tough questions. That's a million dollar question.  </p><p>      I actually think there are more -- there's more resemblance to being mid cycle than late cycle or, you know, the cycle is over. And here is why I think it's mid cycle. So a couple of things are happening. We're finally seeing corporations -- corporate America, which has remained fairly out of the economy for about nine years. All they have been doing is buying back shares.  </p><p>      Now, we're starting to see here strong signals that they're spending money on either hiring or CapEx which is new. That's a big change in trend from what we've seen for this entire bull market.  </p><p>      So, you know, what typically happens when CapEx materializes, that's generally kind of a second, you know, maybe the -- later on in the cycle, but it's not over. You generally see economic growth starts to pick up. You see, you know, the animal spirits. You see a little bit of waver inflation, which we're starting to see as well, but it's not necessarily that overheated inflationary environment where you want to shorten everything and move in to defensive.  </p><p>      I will tell you this. So, I think this cycle is obviously very different from prior cycles.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  And that, you know, I don't think defensive companies are behaving the way defensive companies should. So, when I look at performance this year, this, you know, so far we we've been in a down market year to date. What's been the worst performing strategy this year safe, high dividend yielding stocks.  </p><p>      So, I think the real risk is if we -- if, you know, we -- if you do get a sense that were end of cycle, don't buy high dividend yielding, levered, you know, maximum payout ratio companies like regulated utilities or telecom, because we also have this dynamic of a secular increase in rates.  </p><p>      And I would be just curious what Jim thinks about this. But I just worry that, you know, with so many investors worry that we are at the end of the cycle, they have been flocking to these high dividend yielding, low beta stocks that are actually some of the riskiest places to be in the market today in my view.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Well, Savita, another non-consensus way of looking at this --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  -- perhaps is to sell the new economy and to buy the old economies, but the trade of Banks of America right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, so this is interesting, because what we notice was that new economy stocks like same companies are actually spending money on headquarters and data centers. So they're spending money on like kind of the more traditional picks and-shovel types of CapEx which doesn't necessary mean they're going to do great because their margins are likely to shrink or say a little bit of pressure, but what that benefits are some of the, you know, engineering and construction companies, machinery, your old economy CapEx plays that hasn't really seen a lot of love over the last several years are just coming out of the industrial recession. That might be an area that investors want to rotate into that's generally pretty unloved at this point.  </p><p>      I mean, I guess, you know, when I look at the market, I think that's the one area that is still relatively inexpensive is cyclical. I think that secular growth players like Pink (ph), that's growing very expensive. If you look at high dividend yielding defensive like utilities or staples, those are relatively expensive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  But what's actually pretty cheap are cyclical companies that could benefit from a pickup in the economy from, you know, if we are in mid cycle could benefit from those forces that drive the economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Savita, I do just want to get one final question in to is being when a lot of people they're exploring over the last couple of months or so. Go to cash, what's the go to cash story at Bank of America right now with the front end of the treasury curve looking a lot more attractive relative to where it has been over the last few years?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. So I think, you know, cash is king, cash is marginally more attractive if the Fed continues to hike, cash becomes that much more attractive. So, you know, we are starting to see some, you know, some relative asset allocation calls.  </p><p>      I will tell you this so, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, the good news is most companies are actually sitting on fairly healthy balance sheets. So if you like cash, why not buy, you know, big tech companies or even financial companies that have cleaned up their balance sheets and are arguably over capitalized at this point in the cycle?  </p><p>      You know, I think that might be the kicker if, you know, for the next several year or the foreseeable future --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  -- if the cost of leverage is increasing. You want to stick with cash-rich equities. And that would actually put to into a lot of the bigger cap, you know, multinational areas within the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Savita, always great to get your insight. Joining us from London, Savita Subramanian --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUBRAMANIAN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  -- of Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC6-M0K1-JDPT-T35B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And still with around the table is Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.</p><p>Savita, big conversation here in New York because I'm sure you know about whether we are late cycle, mid cycle, whatever cycle. Where are we in this cycle?</p><p>SAVITA SUBRAMANIAN, HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY AND QUANTITATIVE STRATEGY, BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH: Yes, it's been tough questions. That's a million dollar question.</p><p>I actually think there are more -- there's more resemblance to being mid cycle than late cycle or, you know, the cycle is over. And here is why I think it's mid cycle. So a couple of things are happening. We're finally seeing corporations -- corporate America, which has remained fairly out of the economy for about nine years. All they have been doing is buying back shares.</p><p>Now, we're starting to see here strong signals that they're spending money on either hiring or CapEx which is new. That's a big change in trend from what we've seen for this entire bull market.</p><p>So, you know, what typically happens when CapEx materializes, that's generally kind of a second, you know, maybe the -- later on in the cycle, but it's not over. You generally see economic growth starts to pick up. You see, you know, the animal spirits. You see a little bit of waver inflation, which we're starting to see as well, but it's not necessarily that overheated inflationary environment where you want to shorten everything and move in to defensive.</p><p>I will tell you this. So, I think this cycle is obviously very different from prior cycles.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: And that, you know, I don't think defensive companies are behaving the way defensive companies should. So, when I look at performance this year, this, you know, so far we we've been in a down market year to date. What's been the worst performing strategy this year safe, high dividend yielding stocks.</p><p>So, I think the real risk is if we -- if, you know, we -- if you do get a sense that were end of cycle, don't buy high dividend yielding, levered, you know, maximum payout ratio companies like regulated utilities or telecom, because we also have this dynamic of a secular increase in rates.</p><p>And I would be just curious what Jim thinks about this. But I just worry that, you know, with so many investors worry that we are at the end of the cycle, they have been flocking to these high dividend yielding, low beta stocks that are actually some of the riskiest places to be in the market today in my view.</p><p>FERRO: Well, Savita, another non-consensus way of looking at this --</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Yes.</p><p>FERRO: -- perhaps is to sell the new economy and to buy the old economies, but the trade of Banks of America right now.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Yes. Well, so this is interesting, because what we notice was that new economy stocks like same companies are actually spending money on headquarters and data centers. So they're spending money on like kind of the more traditional picks and-shovel types of CapEx which doesn't necessary mean they're going to do great because their margins are likely to shrink or say a little bit of pressure, but what that benefits are some of the, you know, engineering and construction companies, machinery, your old economy CapEx plays that hasn't really seen a lot of love over the last several years are just coming out of the industrial recession. That might be an area that investors want to rotate into that's generally pretty unloved at this point.</p><p>I mean, I guess, you know, when I look at the market, I think that's the one area that is still relatively inexpensive is cyclical. I think that secular growth players like Pink (ph), that's growing very expensive. If you look at high dividend yielding defensive like utilities or staples, those are relatively expensive.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: But what's actually pretty cheap are cyclical companies that could benefit from a pickup in the economy from, you know, if we are in mid cycle could benefit from those forces that drive the economy.</p><p>FERRO: Savita, I do just want to get one final question in to is being when a lot of people they're exploring over the last couple of months or so. Go to cash, what's the go to cash story at Bank of America right now with the front end of the treasury curve looking a lot more attractive relative to where it has been over the last few years?</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Yes, absolutely. So I think, you know, cash is king, cash is marginally more attractive if the Fed continues to hike, cash becomes that much more attractive. So, you know, we are starting to see some, you know, some relative asset allocation calls.</p><p>I will tell you this so, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, the good news is most companies are actually sitting on fairly healthy balance sheets. So if you like cash, why not buy, you know, big tech companies or even financial companies that have cleaned up their balance sheets and are arguably over capitalized at this point in the cycle?</p><p>You know, I think that might be the kicker if, you know, for the next several year or the foreseeable future --</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: -- if the cost of leverage is increasing. You want to stick with cash-rich equities. And that would actually put to into a lot of the bigger cap, you know, multinational areas within the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>FERRO: Savita, always great to get your insight. Joining us from London, Savita Subramanian --</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Thank you.</p><p>FERRO: -- of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And still with around the table is Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.</p><p>Savita, big conversation here in New York because I'm sure you know about whether we are late cycle, mid cycle, whatever cycle. Where are we in this cycle?</p><p>SAVITA SUBRAMANIAN, HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY AND QUANTITATIVE STRATEGY, BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH: Yes, it's been tough questions. That's a million dollar question.</p><p>I actually think there are more -- there's more resemblance to being mid cycle than late cycle or, you know, the cycle is over. And here is why I think it's mid cycle. So a couple of things are happening. We're finally seeing corporations -- corporate America, which has remained fairly out of the economy for about nine years. All they have been doing is buying back shares.</p><p>Now, we're starting to see here strong signals that they're spending money on either hiring or CapEx which is new. That's a big change in trend from what we've seen for this entire bull market.</p><p>So, you know, what typically happens when CapEx materializes, that's generally kind of a second, you know, maybe the -- later on in the cycle, but it's not over. You generally see economic growth starts to pick up. You see, you know, the animal spirits. You see a little bit of waver inflation, which we're starting to see as well, but it's not necessarily that overheated inflationary environment where you want to shorten everything and move in to defensive.</p><p>I will tell you this. So, I think this cycle is obviously very different from prior cycles.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: And that, you know, I don't think defensive companies are behaving the way defensive companies should. So, when I look at performance this year, this, you know, so far we we've been in a down market year to date. What's been the worst performing strategy this year safe, high dividend yielding stocks.</p><p>So, I think the real risk is if we -- if, you know, we -- if you do get a sense that were end of cycle, don't buy high dividend yielding, levered, you know, maximum payout ratio companies like regulated utilities or telecom, because we also have this dynamic of a secular increase in rates.</p><p>And I would be just curious what Jim thinks about this. But I just worry that, you know, with so many investors worry that we are at the end of the cycle, they have been flocking to these high dividend yielding, low beta stocks that are actually some of the riskiest places to be in the market today in my view.</p><p>FERRO: Well, Savita, another non-consensus way of looking at this --</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Yes.</p><p>FERRO: -- perhaps is to sell the new economy and to buy the old economies, but the trade of Banks of America right now.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Yes. Well, so this is interesting, because what we notice was that new economy stocks like same companies are actually spending money on headquarters and data centers. So they're spending money on like kind of the more traditional picks and-shovel types of CapEx which doesn't necessary mean they're going to do great because their margins are likely to shrink or say a little bit of pressure, but what that benefits are some of the, you know, engineering and construction companies, machinery, your old economy CapEx plays that hasn't really seen a lot of love over the last several years are just coming out of the industrial recession. That might be an area that investors want to rotate into that's generally pretty unloved at this point.</p><p>I mean, I guess, you know, when I look at the market, I think that's the one area that is still relatively inexpensive is cyclical. I think that secular growth players like Pink (ph), that's growing very expensive. If you look at high dividend yielding defensive like utilities or staples, those are relatively expensive.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: But what's actually pretty cheap are cyclical companies that could benefit from a pickup in the economy from, you know, if we are in mid cycle could benefit from those forces that drive the economy.</p><p>FERRO: Savita, I do just want to get one final question in to is being when a lot of people they're exploring over the last couple of months or so. Go to cash, what's the go to cash story at Bank of America right now with the front end of the treasury curve looking a lot more attractive relative to where it has been over the last few years?</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Yes, absolutely. So I think, you know, cash is king, cash is marginally more attractive if the Fed continues to hike, cash becomes that much more attractive. So, you know, we are starting to see some, you know, some relative asset allocation calls.</p><p>I will tell you this so, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, the good news is most companies are actually sitting on fairly healthy balance sheets. So if you like cash, why not buy, you know, big tech companies or even financial companies that have cleaned up their balance sheets and are arguably over capitalized at this point in the cycle?</p><p>You know, I think that might be the kicker if, you know, for the next several year or the foreseeable future --</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: -- if the cost of leverage is increasing. You want to stick with cash-rich equities. And that would actually put to into a lot of the bigger cap, you know, multinational areas within the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>FERRO: Savita, always great to get your insight. Joining us from London, Savita Subramanian --</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN: Thank you.</p><p>FERRO: -- of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

So, I think this cycle is obviously very different  from prior cycles.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  And that, you know, I don't think defensive companies are  behaving the way defensive companies should.  So, when I look at  performance this year, this, you know, so far we we've been in a down  market year to date.  What's been the worst performing strategy this year  safe, high dividend yielding stocks.</p><p>So, I think the real risk is if we -- if, you know, we -- if you do get a  sense that were end of cycle, don't buy high dividend yielding, levered,  you know, maximum payout ratio companies like regulated utilities or  telecom, because we also have this dynamic of a secular increase in rates.</p><p>And I would be just curious what Jim thinks about this.  But I just worry  that, you know, with so many investors worry that we are at the end of the  cycle, they have been flocking to these high dividend yielding, low beta  stocks that are actually some of the riskiest places to be in the market  today in my view.</p><p>FERRO:  Well, Savita, another non-consensus way of looking at this --</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  Yes.</p><p>FERRO:  -- perhaps is to sell the new economy and to buy the old economies,  but the trade of Banks of America right now.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  Yes.  Well, so this is interesting, because what we notice  was that new economy stocks like same companies are actually spending money  on headquarters and data centers.  So they're spending money on like kind  of the more traditional picks and-shovel types of CapEx which doesn't  necessary mean they're going to do great because their margins are likely  to shrink or say a little bit of pressure, but what that benefits are some  of the, you know, engineering and construction companies, machinery, your  old economy CapEx plays that hasn't really seen a lot of love over the last  several years are just coming out of the industrial recession.  That might  be an area that investors want to rotate into that's generally pretty  unloved at this point.</p><p>I mean, I guess, you know, when I look at the market, I think that's the  one area that is still relatively inexpensive is cyclical.  I think that  secular growth players like Pink (ph), that's growing very expensive.  If  you look at high dividend yielding defensive like utilities or staples,  those are relatively expensive.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  But what's actually pretty cheap are cyclical companies that  could benefit from a pickup in the economy from, you know, if we are in mid  cycle could benefit from those forces that drive the economy.</p><p>FERRO:  Savita, I do just want to get one final question in to is being  when a lot of people they're exploring over the last couple of months or  so.  Go to cash, what's the go to cash story at Bank of America right now  with the front end of the treasury curve looking a lot more attractive  relative to where it has been over the last few years?</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  Yes, absolutely.  So I think, you know, cash is king, cash is  marginally more attractive if the Fed continues to hike, cash becomes that  much more attractive.  So, you know, we are starting to see some, you know,  some relative asset allocation calls.</p><p>I will tell you this so, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, the good news is most  companies are actually sitting on fairly healthy balance sheets.  So if you  like cash, why not buy, you know, big tech companies or even financial  companies that have cleaned up their balance sheets and are arguably over  capitalized at this point in the cycle?</p><p>You know, I think that might be the kicker if, you know, for the next  several year or the foreseeable future --</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  -- if the cost of leverage is increasing.  You want to stick  with cash-rich equities.   And that would actually put to into a lot of the  bigger cap, you know, multinational areas within the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>FERRO:  Savita, always great to get your insight.  Joining us from London,  Savita Subramanian --</p><p>SUBRAMANIAN:  Thank you.</p><p>FERRO:  -- of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

US nonfinancial companies, anticipating tax legislation that would enable them to repatriate off shore cash holdings without penalty, brought their total liquid assets to a record $2.1 trillion at the end of 2017, according to S&amp;P Global. Nonfinancial firms in Europe, the Middle East and Africa recorded $1 trillion in corporate cash for the second consecutive year, according to Moody's, even though their net M&amp;A spending nearly tripled to a seven-year high of (EURO)80 billion ($96 billion) in 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The richest were richer than ever as 2018 began. Last year, the cutoff to make the top 25 was $16.3 billion in liquid holdings, and only the top 10 had more than $25 billion. This year, the cutoff for inclusion soared to $24.4 billion, and all but one of the top 25 have more than $25 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year, we expanded our criteria to include all publicly traded nonfinancial companies-even those with majority state ownership. Prior lists excluded any company with more than 50% government ownership, but we sought to give readers a window into the financial position of state-controlled firms. This brought significant new entrants to the regional lists in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p><p>Geographically, US companies continue to dominate the ranking, accounting for 13 positions, seven of them in the Top 10.

The top US big tech firms alone account for a whopping $446.7 billion in cash, 12% more than the previous year. Microsoft stays at the top of this subgroup for the third year in a row with almost $133 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up $19.7 billion from 2016, despite chalking up capital expenditures (capex) of $8.1 billion-roughly the same level as 2016.With $101.9 billion, Google's parent, Alphabet, has the second-biggest cash stash, adding more than $15 billion to its pile. Apple comes third, followed by China Mobile, the world's largest mobile company by market capitalization.

Data valid as of July 20, 2018. All figures in USD millions. Data provided by: Orbis by Bureau van Dijk.</p><p>** Government holds 50%+</p><p>For many other companies, growth in their cash holdings is linked to acquisition plans. AT&amp;T, 8th, grew its cash stash from $5.8 billion to $50.5 billion in just one year, mainly by resorting to the bond market. That bumped up the resources available for the company's planned acquisition this year of Time Warner-finally approved in June after an intense judicial battle, although the decision may be reversed on appeal. Gilead Sciences spent $11.9 billion on the acquisition of Kite Pharma, and at the end of the year still had $25.5 billion on its balance sheet and may be on the lookout for other M&amp;A deals. Qualcomm, on the other hand, recently announced that, in the pall of the US-China trade war, it is dropping its offer to buy NXP for $44 billion after failing to obtain approval from China's antitrust agency. Instead, the company will spend $30 billion on buybacks.</p><p>Central Japan Railway Company (also known as JR Central or JR Tokai) debuts on the list in 16th place. Financing needs for construction of the Chuo Shinkansen magnetic levitation line led JR Central to create a dedicated cash fund that the company has generously fed for the last two years. Another Japanese newcomer is SoftBank Group, which has been raising cash to keep its leverage ratios in line as it pursues an aggressive investment policy. A change in eligibility criteria brought in a few newcomers previously excluded because of their ownership structure, including three from China: China Mobile in 4th place, China State Construction Engineering at 10th, and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical (Sinopec) at 17th. Of those, only Sinopec saw a noteworthy increase in its cash and cash equivalents in 2017, although its cash-to-total-assets ratio is still an unimpressive 13.6%.</p><p>Will 2017 represent a high-water mark for corporate cash holdings? Don't assume it. The American Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) profoundly changed the landscape for corporate-finance practitioners, slashing the top US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and allowing a one-time cash repatriation holiday. Will US companies reinvest those tax savings? Pay down debt? Give raises? How much will they retain? Will the M&amp;A juggernaut continue?</p><h>CAUTION IS BACK</h><p>The direction cash-rich companies will steer post-TCJA is still unclear. In its April 2018 Liquidity Survey, the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) found that up to 40% of respondents were still unsure of the new law's implications and didn't anticipate any changes in their company's expenditures. Almost one in four companies were repatriating overseas cash, 18% planned to increase capex, 15% said they wanted to increase wages and bonuses, 14% planned share repurchases and 8% expected to make new hires. Significantly, companies planning to pay down debt dropped from 65% in 2017 to 26% this year.</p><p>A good deal of the extra cash might remain in liquid form. The AFP Corporate Cash Indicators showed a significant number of US companies continuing to grow their cash holdings in the first months of 2018, although the pace slowed down in the second quarter. Global cash piles may start to decline; but uncertainty, including what looks like a trade war, suggests leading companies may need to maintain comfortable cash buffers.</p><p>M&amp;A is also heating up. In the US, the TCJA has made M&amp;A more attractive for both buyers and sellers by reducing corporate tax rates and allowing companies, at least temporarily, to immediately expense 100% of depreciable tangible assets acquired. Combined with faster growth in Europe, that helped bring global M&amp;A deals to a record $2.5 trillion in the first half of 2018, according to Thomson Reuters, with health care and media companies the leading targets. High valuations, geopolitical risk and increasing tensions between the US and China, with tariff, regulatory and antitrust ramifications, will make it harder to keep up the pace. But absent major disruptions, the global M&amp;A market is on track to break 2007's record $4.1 trillion in transactions.</p><p>Another potential use for excess liquidity is, of course, stock buybacks. The last time Washington offered a repatriation tax holiday, in 2004, analysts estimated 60% to 90% of the funds went to share repurchases. This time around, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch (BofA) estimated that buybacks would be only half of the expected $1.2 trillion of repatriated cash.</p><p>That prediction seems to have been off. Buybacks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 hit $189.1 billion in the first quarter, up almost 10% from the previous record, set in the third quarter of 2007. TrimTabs Investment Research estimated first-quarter buybacks at $242 billion and in the second quarter at a staggering $437 billion. Total returns to investors, including both stock repurchases and dividends, in the first three months of the year reached $1 trillion for the first time in history.</p><p>Apple has set the most ambitious goal by far. In May the company announced it would buy back $100 billion of its own shares. Apple's repurchases amounted to $22.8 billion in the first quarter, accounting for 12% of the total for the S&amp;P 500, and another $20 billion in the second. On June 28, Nike announced a $15 billion repurchase plan. In March, drug maker Amgen added $10 billion to its already active $4.4 billion program. And financial-services companies added a total of $112 billion in buyback announcements, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America announcing plans to repurchase more than $20 billion each.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TOP REGIONAL PUBLIC COMPANIES BY CASH ON BALANCE SHEET * LATIN AMERICA</emphasis></h><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"center\"

Data valid as of July 20, 2018. Data provided by: Orbis by Bureau van Dijk.</p><h>WHAT ABOUT MY RAISE?</h><p>Workers won't get much of the tax-cut windfall. American Airlines, Walt Disney, AT&amp;T and a few others announced tax-cut bonuses early this year and some, including Walmart and Wells Fargo, have raised minimum pay for workers or announced extraordinary contributions to retirement plans. But the higher minimum pay at Wells Fargo, for example, will cost the company a mere $78 million, while its buyback plan will cost $20 billion. And even the bank has waffled on whether it's related to the tax cut or not. Workers at Disney, in the end, never got their raise; it was contingent on accepting management's contract proposal.</p><p>Capex at S&amp;P 500 companies grew 24% in the first quarter, moving even faster than buybacks. But at $166 billion, this is still below the level of share repurchases. And not all sectors are contributing equally. Google's capex in the first quarter tripled its total for the same period the previous year. Apple recently announced it is raising its capex for 2018 to more than $26 billion, doubling its 2017 figure. The energy sector, too, shows money flowing back into oil projects now that prices have recovered.</p><p>Outside the S&amp;P 500, investment activity is positive but less buoyant. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, investment in equipment grew by 6.1% in the first quarter: solid growth, but in line with the last few quarters. Meanwhile, analysts are warning about the artificial boost that buybacks are giving to stock prices.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TOP REGIONAL PUBLIC COMPANIES BY CASH ON BALANCE SHEET * WESTERN

AT&amp;T jumps out of nowhere to 6th place after multiplying its liquid assets by a factor of almost nine in just one year, in preparation for the Time Warner acquisition. Gilead Sciences leaps into 13th place after more than doubling its cash stash. Solid numbers keep General Motors and Coca-Cola in the ranking, losing six positions each despite minor decreases in their absolute liquidity.</p><h>LATIN AMERICA</h><p>Tax havens significantly warp the ranking of Latin America's top cash hoarders, with five of the top ten companies based in Asia but incorporated in the Cayman Islands. In 1st position, with $24.4 billion in cash, is Petrobras, the state-owned Brazilian oil company. But Beijing-based technology companies Baidu and NetEase come 2nd and 3rd. Ctrip, the travel services company headquartered in Shanghai, takes 4th place. It's followed by CK Asset Holdings of Hong Kong (formerly Cheung Kong Property Holdings), which managed to stay in 5th despite losing some fuel. Schlumberger, the French oilfield services provider based in Houston but incorporated in Cura\u00e7ao, takes some steps down the ladder after reducing its cash reserves by 45%; while FEMSA, the Mexican beverage and retail giant, takes a big leap forward by more than doubling its liquid assets.</p><h>WESTERN EUROPE</h><p>The ranks of Europe's most cash-rich companies stayed fairly stable in 2017, with six of last year's top ten remaining in the top ten. Total keeps 1st place for the fourth year running, as it increased its cash holdings almost 25% to $36.2 billion and widened its lead over BP, with $25.7 billion. Daimler, Shell and Vodafone complete Europe's Top 5. Big oil has a strong presence in the ranking, accounting for five companies out of 15. The biggest leap, however, was for Christian Dior, which in the aftermath of the Arnault family's and LVMH's moves to win complete control over the brand has almost tripled its cash holdings to $12.4

Gazprom, with a $15.7 billion pile of cash, is the undisputable regional leader. Rosneft takes 2nd place despite a big dip in its liquidity, which declined by more than half to $9 billion, in part due to a Trump administration ruling against the company's joint venture with ExxonMobil.</p><p>Energy-particularly oil and gas-completely dominates the Central and Eastern Europe rankings, taking the four first spots and bringing four new companies into the Top 10. Geographically, Russian companies reign, occupying the first seven spots. Turkish Airlines, Turkish steel producer Erdemir and Polish oil refiner and retailer PKN Orlen-all state-owned-are the only non-Russian companies making the list.</p><h>ASIA-PACIFIC</h><p>With $71.6 billion of cash in its accounts, state-owned China Mobile takes 1st place in Asia-Pacific this year. Following in 2nd is Toyota, with a stash of $53.9 billion, while China State Construction Engineering takes over 3rd place despite an 8% decrease in its cash holdings to $42.7 billion.

Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) increased its cash stash by 47% in 2017 and lands on top with $15.7 billion. Other companies report much more modest activity. Two telecoms come in 2nd and 4th: Emirates Etisalat and Qatari Ooredoo. In 3rd and 5th places are two real estate developers, Emirati Emaar Properties and Aldar Properties. The only companies in the top 10 without significant government ownership are Check Point Software, the Israeli cybersecurity company, which dropped from 3rd to 7th place despite keeping its cash stash almost unchanged; and Woqod, the Qatari fuel retailer, which fell from 4th to 8th despite an increase of almost 38% to $1.2 billion in cash.</p><h>AFRICA</h><p>The 10 richest African companies are diverse by sector, but very concentrated geographically; all but one are based in South Africa. After more than doubling its cash pile to $4 billion, internet and media group Naspers takes 1st place. Sasol keeps the second spot, despite reducing its liquidity by more than a third to $2.3 billion. MTN, the global mobile telecommunications company, takes over third position with $1.9 billion. The sole non-South-African company in the regional top 10, Nigeria's Dangote Cement, lands in 8th place after increasing its cash reserves by 45% to $550 million.</p><h>METHODOLOGY</h><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Global Finance</emphasis> Cash 25 ranks publicly listed companies by cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities (those maturing between three months and a year) on their balance sheets. Data is gathered from more than 71,000 public companies worldwide. Financial institutions are excluded from the list. Companies that are not publicly traded are excluded as well; to avoid including both a parent and its subsidiaries, we use a minimum 25% holding for the path from a subject company to its ultimate owner as the cutoff for inclusion. This year, publicly traded companies are included even if they are majority owned by the state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, no caption</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8D-W8X1-JC8V-400P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Finance Media, Inc.

BELYANINA, HEAD OF IR, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Good morning. Good morning, today, guests. Hello. We are beginning. Guests are still arriving. It is early morning in Moscow. We know that we are being watched on webcast across the different geographies, so good morning to all of you. Good time of the day.</p><p>We have a very intensive program today. You will note that this is a regular event that we hold every year to briefly discuss the business outcomes of the previous 12 months. And the outlook for the next year of 2020, this time, we're going to share our perspectives with you. We've got 13 speakers today, a very intensive program. We're going to start with a brief overview on strategy. It will be done by Senior Vice President, Yulia Chupina. After that, we're going to discuss the core banking business. The First Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Vedyakhin is going to talk about that. Then we're going to have 2 deep dives into corporate business and into wealth management by Anatoly Popov and Natalya Alymova. After that, we're going to adjourn for a coffee break, and then it's going to be a progress of the tech program -- platform. David Rafalovsky is going to do that. And then it's going to be a full-blown discussion of the ecosystem. The First Deputy CEO Lev Khasis is going to talk. And several chief executive officers of the companies that already are or will be soon in our ecosystem, we're talking Yandex. Market, Rambler, DC and Citymobil. A brief lunch will follow. And then we are going to discuss the prospects for 2020 with the Chief of our Macro Analysis Division, the other executives, the Chief Financial Officer, who are going to speak about the trends and financial indicators, Oleg Zamulin, Dzhangir Dzhangirov and Alexander Morozov are going to cover that bit of the day.</p><p>First off, right off the bat, we're going to have a brief Q&amp;A for all the speakers, and there's going to be 2 big Q&amp;A sessions for the outcomes of the ecosystem discussion and the forecast discussion. The working language is Russian. If you didn't get a simultaneous translation set, please take it. Raise your hand, we're going to help you with that.</p><p>Mobile phones, the disclaimer are obviously the same. I'm not going to waste the time on housekeeping. Let's roll. And have a good day.</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; CFO, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Yes, one more important comment to make. Good day, colleagues. Good day, guests.</p><p>There's going to be a slight change in our agenda. To save on time, we're going to cut short the lunch a little bit. Hopefully, we're going to catch up with the time to finish off about 1 hour, maybe 1.5 hours earlier than we originally envisaged. Hopefully, we're going to be able to accomplish that. And will obviously give you more time to write your reports, so don't you worry. Hopefully, by at least 15:00, perhaps even earlier, we're going to finish this event.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] And with that, I would like to invite Ms. Chupina, Yulia Germanovna Chupina, our Chief Strategist and a Senior Vice President of the bank.</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA, SVP, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Thank you, Stasia. Good morning, all. Thank you very much for your choice to start this wonderful, sunny, fresh morning in Moscow, to start it with us. Thank you for that. I will need the clicker, and there it is. It is a great joy for everyone. Hopefully, we are still your favorite stock.</p><p>And if my talk is to be boiled down to one phrase, we are good on strategy. I'm going to dive deep into details, but this is perhaps the most important takeaway from that. We are delivering on strategy. You will probably remember a lot of criticisms leveled against our critic -- against our market. But in terms of the market, in terms of the margins, in terms of the returns, it's one of the most attractive markets in the world. And when we wrote that strategy, we were actually a little bit more conservative than we should have been on all the banking markets. We have a slightly better growth and a slightly better margin than we had originally envisaged. You will remember that our strategy was about not just being one of the best and perhaps one of the most relevant financial institutions in the Russian market, we started building a big ecosystem around our core business. So the first part was about our best customer experience in finance and in other customer needs. The second big topic of the strategy was tech leadership. The third was strengthening our team. And we believe that if we deliver on all the 3, we're going to arrive at a great financial performance, which is actually happening.</p><p>I'm going to show you these boxes checked, where we are either spot on with the strategy targets or we are a bit off. If there are any nuances, I'm going to talk about those. You will remember that we gave the guidance of the market shares, and we aimed to stay with the same market shares, where we started with that strategy period. It is exactly what has been happening. Perhaps we have been a bit slow in growing the lending to corporates because we took a conscious path to maintain our margin. The same goes for the individuals' market share on deposits with individuals. That said, we launched a pretty broad array of products, for instance, in the retail. I would specifically highlight the products that will again become the very important benchmark for the entire system. First off, we can now disburse a loan in 2 minutes without actually asking a person any questions. There are obvious limitations when we don't ask any questions. These are generally our payroll customers. But in terms of automation, you will appreciate that this is a good new product, these are all good new products. And then we keep adding financial products to our ecosystem companies, for instance, in Peru, the marketplace. You can take a POS loan. We continue developing DomClick, everything around the mortgage. Most of our customers can now enjoy a lot of attended products.</p><p>We launched a new card. It is a fully digital card. And we think that this is a highly promising product. You can activate this card online without getting any physical representation of it. You can actually start transacting with that electronic card.</p><p>Perhaps another important thing -- innovation for our customers was having centralized everything. The customer can now enjoy our capability to be served anywhere with no any difference where he originally got connected. We launched the QR code-based payments, cross-border payments. These were all important products.</p><p>And you may have heard about the regular awards that we have been getting in Russia, in the world, in Europe. And we think that this is the right recognition to be aiming for, the recognition of our conventional and innovative products alike.</p><p>As for the corporate business, you know that this was an important year for us to start financing construction along the new lines we now have escrow accounts. We can also lend to SMEs, small and medium enterprises, in 10 minutes. That is already a possibility. We launched a whole lineup of business cards that is commercial cards for business. We have actually products that have been helping Russia to become more attractive as a place for doing business, for instance, VAT recovery. It used to take 180 days. Now it takes 7 days.</p><p>And this year, there's a whole new segment in Russia and in Sberbank, and we have been actively working with it. This is a segment of self -- of the self-employed, the self-employed people as well as private entrepreneurs.</p><p>We have been developing those electronic channels actively. This is a worldwide trend. We have in excess of 15 million customers in Sberbank Online. You can see the growth in the ratio down of MAU, daily average users -- monthly average users, in retail and in corporate businesses better than competition. Over 40% in both the businesses have been happening online, and between 80% to 100% of services, again, are used online. Having said that, we relaunched our corporate Sberbank Online as SBOL. And we intend to continue with the digital upgrade, the digital revamp of the application.</p><p>You will hear a lot about the ecosystem. Guys are going to come in front of you from all our new businesses. It's always great to see all of them.</p><p>Let me remind you about why we are doing this. We think that the future of banking is going to be changing materially. We don't want to become a commodity. It's very important for us to keep that last mile of the relationship with the customer. We want our customers to be served by us as much as we can digitally and physically. Although about 90% of our transactions are still the financial business, but we are adding on all kinds of things, all kinds of new occasions where we can close some kind of need of a customer, where we can serve some kind of a need of a customer.</p><p>In this box, you can see our big partnerships and acquisitions. Basically, we are following the needs of the customers that are well presented in this slide. This is a slide from the strategy. You may remember the way we identified the time that customers or companies spend in getting served and the frequency of getting served, the size of the potential business was chartered here as the various industries are interested -- that the customers are interested in.</p><p>The bright green -- I beg your pardon, the blue is what Sberbank used to cover. And this is where we are at the end of 2019. There's much more coverage. We are striving to make customers to spend more time with us much more. So they don't have to go anywhere outside this ecosystem.</p><p>Why is this important? It is important because our branches have been gradually transformed. There's increasingly fewer people in branches. The foot traffic is going down, which is good in terms of digital channels because that is better cost of service. But then we appreciate that this is still an asset to retain. It needs to be depreciated. And because we are getting new products, we understand that we can reload this asset with more work.</p><p>And then we appreciate our social responsibility in Russia as a big employer. Not only are we keen to increase the financial literacy of the population, as a long term, working with branches would be the right thing to do because that is a touch point for the entire nation and for the business.</p><p>Appreciably, there are some big names with some several million clients. Our ecosystem spans e-commerce, that is our JV with Yandex. Market; that's Delivery Club; that's Citymobil; ALCO; the video streaming service, Rambler. Those are all the digital services that we are using to bundle up with financial products, and we intend to retain the customer retention and frequency of touch points with customers.</p><p>That said, we make a lot of circles in the market when we buy something. But if you juxtapose the value of those investments with the core business, those are not important amounts, except perhaps for the 2 that Lev is going to talk about. Those gave us access to promising markets. They gave us access to customers, to data. And you will appreciate that you can do a lot with data and especially if you know how to do that.</p><p>In terms of the tech leadership, there are things for us to finish in the platform. You know that we have been investing long and a lot into the tech retooling of the bank. This year, we can positively say that the new platform is viable because Sberbank Online is now fully on it. The front capability of it is there. The back office for that is, again, revolving around the customer. Again, it's there. It used to be about products. Now it's about full knowledge of the customer, and there's 21 products there.</p><p>We launched a big data factory that supports reporting, that helps manage all the data flows in the bank. And there's a superstructure of analytical platform above the data factory. So all our AI analysts can have a repository for the models and tune up those models pretty quickly.</p><p>And there's another big initiative that we launched this year, and we're going to continue developing it next year. That's our cloud. You certainly know that Russia is behind on the number of businesses in the cloud. We see a great promise in using cloud capabilities for ourselves and our customers alike. We have launched a lot of projects where third-party customers use our cloud capability for their business.</p><p>Finally, we can now -- we can positively say that we are an omnichannel business. All our branches are going to be working on an application that is going to be very similar to SBOL, Sberbank Online, and all the front and the back are going to be the same.</p><p>And thanks to these technological innovations, thanks to transitioning all this -- all our organization into agile together with IT, we decreased the time to market 7x. We are now much quicker in deploying -- in developing and deploying products and services. Having said that, the capacity of the platform are spot on, on the parameters that we planned for when we launched all those programs. Perhaps one of the most -- we're probably one of the most efficient and effective banks in terms of cybersecurity. There was one big, high-profile case of internal fraud that was broadly covered. We still have been funding pretty much all of the attacks that we got subjected to. We now learned the hard way about the need to protect ourselves internally from the internal fraud, and we are actively working to prevent social engineering.</p><p>AI transformation is, again, a reality given the new platform. It's important for the AI models to be built into the products and services. We now have about 25 propositions to customers done in real time. And next year, the guys run the figures, about RUB 1 billion is going to be -- about $1 billion is going to be earned by AI initiatives. I mentioned the NLP platform, natural language processing, AI cloud. You may have read that we're going to be helping not just ourselves but the nation at large. Together with all the companies in the consortium, we're going to be pursuing the AI strategy because we appreciate that AI is going to change everything dramatically, not just the banking industry, and we want to help Russia to be one of the leaders in the area.</p><p>And all of that is obviously done by people. They are essential for the success of all that. We set ourselves a lot of objectives in changing how we work with people, how we attract talent, how we develop leaders that work in our organization. And it's a big organization, 300,000 strong, and it can actually become bigger. If you tally in all the couriers and drivers from all the new businesses, there's going to be interesting things to happen next year in HR, how do you work with this big, bulging team. And we do a lot of things to make HR more technological because we think that a lot of processes can be done automatically and can be centralized.</p><p>Because there's a big shortage of qualified employees nationwide, we launched initiatives to prepare talent not just for ourselves, but for the market. That's School 21. They train coders, IT guys. Next year, we're going to develop -- we're going to open a design school because product design is another competency in short supply. And we decided to develop our own HR platform because we think that SAP and success factors are not the cutting-edge products that could be in market.</p><p>We spoke about agile. All the headquarters -- all the HQs working in HR, all the finance guys, business people, you name it, they are in HR -- they are in agile. Besides the accelerated time to market, that new culture, the agile culture is giving a new framework, a new culture of developing software. About 90% is being done as a DevOps effort. HR -- agile is doing everything more transparent, and we continue to improve the tools. How do we see all the way deep down to the budget of every support to the speed with which they develop the code, how reliable that code is. And next year, we're going to unify, standardize these practices for the group, including all the new ecosystem companies.</p><p>The traditional question to hear at one of these days is the headcount. We launched the strategy with 90,000. We cut about 30,000 in the transactions where we could automate, in business efficiency. We added about 15,000 people in the initiatives that we need to become a tech company. These are primarily IT specialists, these are data scientists, these are product designers, and these are the ecosystem companies.</p><p>So we think that in general, we have a more balanced situation now, a more balanced team that is needed for the future technology development of the future. And our network has become 15% more efficient, so that means that with the same amount of people, we do more business.</p><p>In terms of the financial performance, we're going to discuss that in great detail today. But anyway, in a nutshell, we are delivering on all our commitments, and we hope that you appreciate that, you appreciate our dividends and ROE.</p><p>So basically, that is it. I'm ready to answer the questions.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much, Yulia. Colleagues, please, questions. So please raise your hand, introduce yourself and make -- and say the question. Alan, please.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALAN RAMSEY WEBBORN, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: You're talking about the sort of omnichannel branches and/or system. And you've mentioned a new branch sort of strategy. And you've talked actually more certainly than probably last year about the linkage between online and branches. And why is that now? Is it because you feel that you are not maximizing the revenues from clients who are still reluctant to go fully online? I feel that there's a slight change from last year. So what's behind that thinking? And could you perhaps just expand a little bit more on what you mean about this sort of new branch sort of policy and strategy?</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: Well, first of all, we now have the opportunity to be omnichannel because without the new platform, we didn't have that opportunity. So I think this is the major change which happened this year, and it will be fully implemented next year. So the client coming to our office can continue the operation online in his mobile application or go into call center, and it will be the same kind of data that our employee will see, and he can basically have that omnichannel experience, which was the target of the Strategy 2020. So this is one.</p><p>The second one, we're obviously looking around the world, and we think that now it's sort of proven that all the technological companies, even those that started digital, decided that online to offline is the most interesting combination. So that's why you would see Amazon and others purchasing offline branches.</p><p>And for us, we just discussed it a lot in between ourselves whether we see that the offline would be as efficient as digital. And we think it will be because of several reasons. One is we want the client to come to whatever channel that is convenient because we want this last-mile relationship with the client. And once again, you know that even in developed world, there are still clients who want to go to the branch for different reasons, and we want to give him this opportunity.</p><p>Second, the next year, you will see the new product range launched into branches from the companies of our ecosystem. So if today mostly the branches are selling financial products and mostly banking, I would say, next year, it would be nonbanking financial products and also ecosystem products. So that would drive the branches' efficiency up.</p><p>And thirdly, it's the question that you were asking every year, like how many branches are you going to keep and how many people, so I just decided to put it straight away in the presentation. You know where our thinking is. Next year, we will be writing our new strategy for the next 3 years. And the usage of channel will be one of the discussions in terms of how do we build our ecosystem. You know that there are different approaches, whether to let some of the competitors be with us or some of the partners be with us, but this is the discussion for the next year.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Gabor?</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY, RESEARCH ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: It's Gabor Kemeny from Autonomous Research. A question on this AI transformation. You mentioned, I think a $1 billion additional impact in 2020. In what form shall we expect this to come through? Do you see this as additional revenues from product sales, from fee-generating businesses, potential cost savings? A little more color would be helpful.</p><p>And in your corporate lending market share, you mentioned that you lost some of the corporate lending market share recently. Do you expect this to continue?</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: Well, let me start with the first, and my friend and colleague, Alexander Vedyakhin, will definitely help me on both as the Head of Business and the Head of AI Transformation as well.</p><p>On the market share, let me be very explicit here. You can see that we started the strategy with 32% of the market, and we are here with 31%, so I wouldn't call it the loss of the market. I would call it the strategy which is -- which allows us to keep the margins. So we are not going for the loans which are -- which give us less profitability that we want to. You know that it depends on the borrower and the possibilities he has. So we are very conscious of going for good borrows with good profitability but also with good risk profile. So it's not that we are losing market, it's we are keeping the market more or less the same. We are not going after expansion based on the margin as some of our competitors do.</p><p>And in terms of the AI transformation, the effects will come both from revenues and costs. I think you know that AI usually is very interesting to give the client personalized offer and to recommend the product which will be the best in his situation because we did the modeling based on the segmentation on what we know about the client that, at this particular moment, he would be more inclined of buying this or that and suggesting it to him. So that's why here, for example, one of the figures that we were looking yesterday, it's not here today, but as I said, 25% of what we offer now to the client is personalized, and it's tailored to this client need. So it definitely increases the probability of him buying this product. So this is the revenue side.</p><p>On the cost side, chatbots, for example, are wonderful. 40% of our incoming queries are now done by chatbot, so definitely decreases the number of people we need in the call centers, for example.</p><p>And Alexander, I don't know, do you want to add anything on AI? Or you will be saying something during...</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN, FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, SENIOR VP &amp; HEAD OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICE, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: I will address that.</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: You will address?</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: Yes.</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: Okay.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. We have some time for the last question. Mikhail, please? Not using the microphone. And you can switch to Russian.</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV, EQUITIES\u00c2\u00a0ANALYST, VTB CAPITAL, RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] It's Mikhail Shlemov from VTB Capital. Yulia, when you talked about sort of the personnel, the headcount and the challenges for 2020, you mentioned that you have to address this large headcount issue because there will be a lot of employees in the ecosystem that are not typical for the bank like couriers, drivers and so on and so forth. But if you look at our -- at your operational model in terms of how you work in the ecosystem, it is based on GVs. So there is no consolidated financial reporting for the partners. Does that mean that next year, you're going to review your model of working with other partners, and you will become the managing partner there? What -- how it will impact the financial results?</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: [Interpreted] That does not mean that. We're just trying to be proactive. And even if we are not a majority shareholder, we understand that when a company has a lot of taxi drivers and couriers, that means that it affects the cost efficiency and satisfaction, and it might be a potential for us in terms of the strategic partnership with these people. But I think that you will know more about that in our new strategy.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Yulia, thank you very much for coming here and for your presentation and for the Q&amp;A. I think in a year, we're going to have a larger event when we're going to report on the results on all of implementation of 2020 Strategy and when we are going to present to you our new strategy. Thank you very much.</p><p>Yes, thank you all, and we're giving the floor to Alexander Vedyakhin, First Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: [Interpreted] Good morning, dear colleagues. It's a great pleasure to see you all here. Thank you for coming. And as far as I understand, we have people present here. The event is broadcasted. So good morning to all.</p><p>I'm going to talk about the business, the financial business -- core business of the bank that currently generates the bulk of the profits and that is paying the dividends. I'll be followed by Anatoly Popov and Natalya Alymova. Anatoly is responsible for corporate business, Natalya is responsible for the wealth management business. So you can ask questions related to these 2 businesses to me or to these 2 colleagues of mine.</p><p>Now I'm going to talk about the retail. We have some things to tell about the retail. There were some new developments. So I'm going to talk about the retail business, CIB and wealth management. So these are the 3 colleagues responsible for these businesses: Svetlana, responsible for retail business; Anatoly, CIB; and Natalya Alymova, wealth management.</p><p>We have more than 95 million retail clients, more than 2.5 million corporate clients. We deliver more than 20% ROE. Net fees and commission year-on-year are growing basically by 10%. And the net profit is RUB 633 billion. These are the profits delivered by this block.</p><p>You hear things about the retail, what's the picture? The mortgage market share is 54%. Retail loans market share, that's around 41%. And retail deposits market share is around 44%. This is a very promising figure. That means that basically every citizen of Russia, regardless of age, has a debit card issued by Sberbank. Maybe people will have even 2 debit cards, regardless of the age. But anyway, that means that we are the largest issuer of cards in Russia.</p><p>Talking about the dynamics now. It's very important that this year, we have been developing quite actively our online and distant remote channels. You see that the share of transactions went from 37% to 43%, and that's a trend. That's not it. And those who have our Sberbank Online app can select loans, interest rate, fine-tune all the parameters, just to play with it. When we launched the service, we had around 120 attempts from 1 person who was trying to get just the loan that he wanted. He was playing with all the parameters of the loan. So you can do that, too, just for fun.</p><p>Now transports acquiring, the cities with transport acquiring. This year, there will be 100 cities with transport acquiring. You can pay for your commute with your card. And the transport is equipped with the terminals so that you can pay noncash. Cash-out is our initiative that we have developed this year. And in the end of last year, it used to be 0. Now this year, it's going to be around 3,000. That's a very important thing because the availability of financial services for the population is on top of the agenda every time. And this approach helps to optimize our costs related to the opening of the new branches because opening a new branch, that's very expensive. But if you do a cash-out and pay a small fee to shop, that's okay, and that delivers -- and that caters to the needs of the customers. So we are going to develop this one, too.</p><p>Digital cards means Sberbank Online. Without going to the brick-and-mortar branch, you can get a card. And our customers have more than 1 million digital cards that you can use to pay in the Internet. Or if you have a phone with NFC, you can use this card, too. You don't need to wallet now because everything is going to be in your smartphone.</p><p>Our -- one of our favorite services that is doing great, DomClick. This slide describes its success story, RUB 4 trillion of mortgage portfolio and RUB 5 billion of annual income from new services that are delivered by DomClick. We started to develop DomClick as a mortgage platform, online platform. But now DomClick is used for the customers and by the customers to rent a flat, to buy a flat, obviously. I mean anything related to the properties, notary offices, notary services, renovation services, that's in the full -- real estate ecosystem, and we're going to develop that, and we're going to drive up the profits for this system. And as you can see, it is off to a strong story.</p><p>Product lending, POS lending, we have launched this product. Currently, it's around RUB 300 million. It's not a lot. That means lending in the point of sales. By the end of the year, we're going to double this volume, and this is one of the emerging trends in our bank. This is something we are going to actively develop with our partners. And we are now actively developing our sales network. And that means that we are going to deliver a good margin here, too.</p><p>Zero fields for our loan applications. It used to be 15% of loans, now it's 50%. We want to move this figure to 80% or 90%. That means that every person using Sberbank Online would be able to get a loan just by pushing a button, no documents, no certificates needed. So this is a very important trend. We are going to develop it even further. But now 50% of the loan applications are delivered online. And this -- when we had our own Black Friday, which is called the Green Day, Green Day of Sberbank, hundreds of thousands of requests were approved in 1 day. These were hundreds of thousands of applications for loans, and it was all delivered, thanks to the zero field technology. RUB 7.6 trillion for retail lending, that is growing from RUB 6.4 trillion. And deposits went up from RUB 12.6 trillion to RUB 13.7 trillion.</p><p>AI, Yulia has started to talk about that. Colleagues, I would like to say that AI is not some fancy tool for us. We analyze cost-to-income ratio for each initiative. We validate the profitability of each initiative. And each AI initiative, large AI initiative is verified and validated by our Department of Finance. And many of you know Mr. Morozov. And you can be quite sure that he would never -- no AI initiative would pass through him if it is not efficient enough. So we do not make these tools just to make these tools, these toys, really. We do some things that do deliver.</p><p>For instance, we have implemented -- in mass personalization, we have implemented some new things. In Sberbank Online, you have your own personalized screen. So if you compare my screen with Yulia's screen or with Morozov's screen, it will be different. The recommendations would be different. It's not only about the money and the portfolio of the instruments that we have with the recommendations. Personalized recommendations will be different. And these personalized recommendations help to boost the loyalty of the customers and to improve the consumer and other services.</p><p>In the call center, the contact center, the bulk serves about 40% of calls and chat contacts. Just for you to understand, that's a huge cost saving.</p><p>On the corporate business and the wealth management, I'm just going to breeze through a bit quicker because my colleagues are going to address those topics in greater detail. And since I've got about 10 minutes left, I'll probably leave more for handling your questions. Here's the figures, the deltas. There's a growth in the main areas, active corporate clients, the number of users and the number of users in the online channels. This thing is interesting, the 7 minutes. It used to be 1 billion. Now it's 101 billion worth of these loans. That's when corporate customer can borrow in 7 minutes, in line with -- in light of all the procedures, legal, security, underwriters, lending people and all the other businesses in the bank involved. The customer can actually get the loan in 7 minutes, dead. This is the time to money. And this portfolio is 101 billion strong, and there's a 1 and a 0 NPL.</p><p>The corporate credit portfolio has been shrinking. It has not been shrinking. That was the question. It has not been shrinking. It was rationalized. As Yulia justly said, we are maximizing our margins. Every call that we have with our analysts is, \"Hello, how are you doing on margin?\" This is the question number one. Number two and number three is does it maintain the right balance between the assets, liabilities and the margin. Well, some loans fall out. The lower part just drifted away, the lower income part of the portfolio. But look at the graphs in retail. This is how we maintain the overall margin bank-wide and how we -- this is how we drive this margin. And we went into marginal management to maintain that margin, and it has been stable. It is being stable now.</p><p>Wealth management, you see the figures, growth across the board. Natalya Alymova is going to dwell in detail on our successes.</p><p>Now on the approach to customers, this is a story where we launched. Conversion increased about 25%. And we are now giving personalized offers to everyone. That's what we did with Andrey Kurpatov, the Neurosciences Lab. And Andrey told us a lot of good things about communicating the right way with various types of people. Some people are more emotional, some more figure minded. Well, you are obviously more about numbers, but then there are a lot of people who are mostly about emotions and all kinds of things in between. And depending on the cytotype of the person, communication is tailored.</p><p>There's a new format -- there are new formats for distribution and working with the ecosystem. Again, Lev is going to do well in detail on that. But we are seeing a very simple story here. There are -- the banking products are increasingly commoditized, and this has been a trend for a while. For customers to get all the possible products in the bank, it would be the -- it would be highly useful to add ecosystem products to the offering. This is how we maintain the touch points for the customers. Okko is a great online streaming service, but bank customers buy into Okko. They certainly have the time to chat with our branch manager, who has the time to sell some banking services to that customer. And they are, at this time, much more profitable. This is the ecosystem that maintains the attention of the customer. So our job right now is to be as -- to spend as much time with the customer as possible both online and offline. And the changes to our branches are predicated mostly on that strategy. We will be trying a lot of new formats. You all will have heard about this McDonald's format, the [Coffee Office 2020], the new initiative about the agent network. We're going to try all kinds of formats of communicating with customers. It is important for us to maintain as short a distance with customer as possible and to meet -- satisfy as many of customer needs as we possibly can.</p><p>Self-service terminals, ATMs, they're all new. Next year, you're going to see newer ATMs still, new, bigger screen ATMs, AI-driven ATMs that can personalize the offering to any specific individual that approaches the ATM. There's going to be biometrics there. But the outcomes, you're going to see those next year. We're going to dwell on those next year again.</p><p>Sales agents, 3,500 that has been developing and it will develop even further. What our colleagues in the branch network are doing is selling. They are being assisted with next-best-thing prompts. And because this is pretty tedious, when all those prompts pop up, just go ahead and just do this. This customer needs to be sold this and that, this, this is the machine, obviously, and this is part of the engines of our efficiency, but this is pretty difficult. I mean psychologically, it's difficult. So we developed a kind [e-sonic ISU]. This is a smart management system of Sberbank that gives the proposals, and you can talk, you can chat with this kitten-like character. It helps to drive the sales. 128 dialogues have been recorded with [e-sonic] with this pet character.</p><p>We have this gamification lab. Our offices facing customers are doing a lot of hard work. So this helps to lower the psychological tension on the part of those customer-facing staff. And 59% MAU is again very cool.</p><p>The Teal branches, these are the branches with a lot of initiatives delegated to the employees as opposed to managers. Twice is -- the engagement is twice higher. We don't really push them. This is a very interesting format. We have been using it very actively. And gamification is, again, a major track of activity advanced at the bank.</p><p>Regional projects, a big topic. PPP, public private partnerships, we have been advancing that actively. Anatoly Popov is going to give you more flesh on that.</p><p>AI transformation, I'm going to skip certain slides. Now this is what we have been speaking about, what Yulia brought up. Again, in 2020, AI transformation is going to give us Sberbank the additional $1 billion in income, an additional $1 billion in income. That's just one figure to illustrate the efficiency, AI transformation of Sberbank, 2020, the additional $1 billion income. These are -- this is a verified figure. The finance department verified that. This is not an arbitrary off the top of my head figure. We have a very rigorous procedure around these figures driven by the finance department. AI transformation is a major effort inside the bank to drive efficiency.</p><p>Very importantly, the processes, whenever we introduce AI into any process, AI works like a magic sauce. It cuts costs. It increases customer loyalty, internal and external. And AI can transform processes beyond recognition. The 7-minutes process, the lending in 7 minutes, we just put aside the underwriters and lending people for a while, and we introduced the people who are savvy in machine learning. They drew up the 7-minute process. Then we verified it, then we honed it and polished it, but AI can change that process top to bottom. This is a new generation of processes.</p><p>And the management of processes is another priority. It's another major initiative. In the bank, the whole Executive Board is behind it, and it has been developing very actively.</p><p>Perhaps so much I can say on this. I've got 1.4 minutes. But if colleagues give me more time, I can handle more questions. Yes, let's play it by ear. Let's start with those questions. Yes.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: 95 million, that's a lot of customers. Can you discuss trends in demographics and what they mean to the growth outlook? What can the number of active customers be in 3 years, in 5 years, in 10 years from now?</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: Thank you, [Andy]. So I think the number of active customers will increase, but we are limited with the number of population. Yes, that's with some restrictions. So it will -- I hope it will increase because there are customers that are not with Sberbank yet. But the growth will be increased -- or will be limited just by the number of people living in Russia.</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: Maybe one word on demographics. We added 6 million customers in 2 years, and most of them are young people, so we are very happy about that since they're going to be long with the market.</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: Thank you, Yulia. And also, now we are trying to find out a good strategy in some niche markets. For example, working emigrants, so they're coming to Russia and working in Russia, and they would like to send money to Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan, so for countries they are coming from. And now in almost all ATMs, they can find out transfers and communication in their own language, I mean in Uzbekian language, in Tajikistan language and other languages. And this is really helpful. And this is a bundle we're selling for them. It's Sberbank (inaudible), for example, because they would like to call the parents or wives in the home countries. And also, they would like to make transfers and to have some money on the credit/debit card to be able to pay something in Russia. So this is the pool together in one bundle, selling it, and this is really successful.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. More questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] [Helena Zarabova, MKS]. My question relates to the small and medium enterprises. You didn't really address that. But how -- I mean how important is it? What are the trends there? And that used to be a good driver this year.</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: [Interpreted] Thank you, [Helena]. That is a big and very loved topic of ours. Anatoly Popov is the ambassador of the movement in the bank. So Anatoly is going to go right on the case in detail and a lot. This is the right driver, and we really hope that it's going to develop further on and the government is going to be behind this development.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay. Two more questions. Let's take those.</p><p>MIKHAIL GANELIN, SENIOR ANALYST OF FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TRANSPORT, ATON LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] Mikhail Ganelin, Aton. We appreciate there's more room to boost efficiency through AI of all things. Product sales, you speak a lot about that. More products are going to be offered by live streaming services. Do you think the capacity is there? You are selling an X number of products to a customer. Going forward 3 to 5 years, can you increase that products per customer number? And the simple part of the question, POS lending, Sberbank used to be in it. You quit it for a while, and now you are back in it. What are the plans here?</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: [Interpreted] Thank you, Mikhail. As I'm answering your first question, we are using this sales shelf in our work, this concept of sales shelf. All the touch points, they're essentially marks, they're essentially window -- shop windows. People obviously have some kind of limitation on buying, psychological, financial, temporal. There's all kinds of limitations. Now we created a financial model that allows us to rationalize sales with -- from the same shelf. I mean some products are on the same shelf. But in terms of retail, some products are just facing customers on the eye level. This is the first contact that is done by our customer relationship manager. These are mostly, obviously -- this is obviously the most profitable products. But if the customer have a special need or has the time or wish, we have a dynamic sales shelf that provides this next best section, next best offer. And it suggests the next thing to offer to this customer. This is obviously smart management system-based, and it rationalizes the sale while obviously maximizing the profit and customer lifetime value for each individual customer. But this should not be pushy because, otherwise, we're going to be pushing all the high-margin products on people, forcing people off with it without building that balance. But I think right now, we are building that balance.</p><p>This concept of sales shelf, dynamic sales shelf, that allows us to rationalize the sales, profit and maintain the length of customer relationship because you can burn out a customer, just pile on the products on them, borrow that mortgage, get some life insurance from us, the accrual type, and preferably use something more profitable from us and bolt on some kind of a derivative on that consumer loan. And the customer might be very, very disappointed in 6 months.</p><p>So our objective is to maximize not just NPV but customer lifetime value, CLTV.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Mikhail Shlemov and then another lady. I can't fail to reject that. And Mikhail Shlemov always asks the right -- the interesting questions. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Could your initiatives, like the agency network, new agents, cash points or line sales, help you go back to shrinking the branch network? And I'm not talking to 2020, I'm talking about a longer-term horizon. And I'm not talking a short shrinkage, I'm talking about considerable decrease of your footprint.</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: [Interpreted] I do not think this is the right thing to do, and this is not vindicated -- I mean the decrease of the branch network, this is not vindicated by any calculations. The branch network is our powerful advantage at this time. No one has a branch network like ours. I mean there's a bank that is close to us in scale but not the quality and not the depth of penetration. No one has that. And the bundling this strategic advantage would be shortsighted. It would not be farsighted.</p><p>We -- I mean another question is how we use that strategic advantage the right way, but this is a strategic advantage, make no mistake about it. And even the branches and remote areas are an advantage of the same kind. We have been following this active sales shelf concept, all other -- all kinds of other strategies. We need to use all those to turn the branch into a touch point, into a gravity point that would be self-recouping in terms of cost-to-income ratio. This is not easy. This is what we have been laboring hard on with our finance people, but this is what we see to be our advising, continuing strategic advantage. We have the slogan, make [VSPs], make branches great again.</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV: [Interpreted] Alexander, very interesting presentation. When you spoke about AI, you mentioned that the finance department clears all the initiatives. And how do you assess the financial efficiency of bundling ecosystem products? What is this going to mean in terms of customer returns or in maximization of customer lifetime value or NPV? How do you assess that effect?</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: [Interpreted] That's a good question, Mikhail. Thank you. We evaluate that from several standpoints. First off, we measure the CLTV, customer lifetime value, because if we start measuring ecosystem products in NPV terms or next year's profit, you won't see a lot of immediate financial outcome. But having said that, we are selling services that are frequently used, and they are for the long term. Mobile service, mobile connectivity, a frequently used long-term service; video streaming, frequently used long-term service. So we are trying to develop this custom on the part of clients, remember Sberbank much more frequently than they have the need for financial services because right now, most loans -- I mean already, most of the loans are in people's pockets. It used to be a whole big story. I mean it used to take 2 weeks to take out a cash loan. Now it takes about 3 minutes. And if it's 5 minutes, people stop borrowing. What is this about? Why are we not getting the approval in 2 minutes? So that's becoming increasingly commoditized. But a person does not need a loan every day, thankfully. They need mortgage like 2 times, lifetime deposits, not really payments, well, you put auto payments. So we need high-frequency, long-term services that we are going to use to build the good relations with the customers. And sometimes, we subsidize -- kind of subsidize some of these areas, some of these business lines, but we get the attention of the customers. And we are going to be the first choice when a customer needs our high-profit, high-yield financial service.</p><p>So yes, we target CLTV for bundles. We have NPV and CLTV evaluations that are run differently because we might have a great CLTV but then the NPV would be negative. So this is a kind of combination of factors. But Morozov is always making this a hard time for us. Literally, I love the questions, by the way.</p><p>ANDREY MIKHAILOV, RESEARCH ANALYST, SOVA CAPITAL LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] Andrey Mikhailov, Sova Capital. I would like to go back to the $1 billion of effects of the AI. And the question is in what segments do you see the most -- the major effect and perhaps some products that were the most affected by the AI transformation.</p><p>ALEXANDER A. VEDYAKHIN: [Interpreted] Thank you very much for your question. It's very simple. The more standardized transactions there are, the more AI is used. First of all, this is a retail business where you have this kind of massive story about massive standard transactions. Corporate business, they need to make quick decisions, and the actions are massive and standardized and typical. Compliance, it is a very complicated checks that is done in compliance, yet the machine intelligence does help to address these complicated compliance issues. And obviously all of our internal processes and decisions, we used to take experts to make a decision or we built some very complicated algorithms. Now AI helps us to understand what to improve in specific processes within the bank, in our back office and basically in all of our service and functions.</p><p>So basically, I think there is no large process in the bank that would not be AI-driven. But first of all, the top priority is massive typical transactions, the way we use AI. And we use AI as a magic sauce, and it's kind of improves the efficiency like by 20% or 30%. It delivers $1 billion like let's just use it everywhere.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay. Thank you very much, colleagues, for the questions. Thank you very much, Mr. Vedyakhin. And Anatoly Popov is the next speaker. Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, SENIOR VP &amp; HEAD OF THE CORPORATE BUSINESS BLOCK, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Good morning, dear friends. It's a great pleasure for me to see you all here.</p><p>When I go and talk about the corporate business and about the global markets, I think we will start with the most important things. The client base growth in the small business, it is the client base that is the generator of the profits. If you take a look at the profitable segments, the most profitable segment in the corporate lending is small business in Sberbank. So small business issues are on top of the agenda -- of our agenda. These figures that you see in terms of the customer base growth, these are good. And our bank has become the best bank or the first choice bank for the small business, a very quick very profitable bank, very affordable bank. Our fees are very attractive, and it helps to get our customers to acquiring and selling their products. These are the most profit-generating products.</p><p>And if you talk about the yields and profitability in small businesses, small businesses -- for small businesses, I mean the bank has a huge operational income and fee and commission income. And this fee income is larger than compared with the largest segment.</p><p>If you talk about the dynamics for the corporate loan portfolio, it's quite -- it's going quite okay. We do not -- we were not very aggressive here. We're not very aggressive to grow the market share. But the quality of loan portfolio and the margin is the most important things because, obviously, if we give out high-quality loans, that means that the margin is growing and our quality is higher than compared with the competitors. We like complicated and challenging projects. We do not like this routine lending stuff. We want to participate in projects with upside and just to have some challenge. But that means that our loan portfolio growth is quite -- might look quite tepid.</p><p>The appreciation of the Russian ruble also means that the growth of the portfolio was not that high. But if you look at the segments of small business and medium businesses, they are the most -- they deliver the most -- the majority of the margin, and they are growing as quickly -- quicker than everyone else. And that means that we deliver the loans that are very profitable for us.</p><p>And another thing, perhaps the currency breakdown, ruble and dollar. In 2016 and 2015, 2014, after the crisis, there was quite a lot of corporate loans denominated in foreign currency, but we have committed ourselves to implement the following rule. If a customer has a foreign-denominated revenue, they can get a foreign-denominated -- foreign currency-dominated loan. So if they're exporting something, that's okay. Obviously, there's -- for development, for instance, we do not give the developers dollar-denominated loans. So we focus and prioritize these foreign-denominated -- foreign currency-denominated loans to the exporters and other companies.</p><p>Market shares, everything is stable in small business and the large business. Talking about the deposits we're working better here. In terms of the corporate deposits, we now are able to quote the deposits in online for all customers in 1 second. And for largest companies that have short-term deposits and long-term deposits with us, and that goes for the small and medium businesses, all these tools are available online. That means that we can grow our market share in the corporate deposit market.</p><p>Now small business lending, this is SME lending, there is a registry of these companies done by the tax authority. We see that we are growing market shares 35.3% from 1.1 trillion to 1.7 trillion, we're growing. That's our growth. Without that, the SME lending would stagnate in Russia, and that means that Sberbank is driving all that market, SME lending market. And this year, we are continuing the stable growth. It was 17% of annual growth. Last year, it was 20%. That means that we are the leading bank in this market. And we are better than all the banks combined in this market.</p><p>If you're talking about the state support mechanisms Sberbank is using quite actively, we are leading in all programs, in all state programs of the subsidies. This is the program of the Ministry of Agriculture that subsidize the key rate. And in line with this program, this kind of small farms have a 20% of support and 80% program of the Ministry of Economic Development. And we got RUB 140 billion there from this program, benefited from this program. And we have a very positive outlook for the next year. And the Far Eastern Development Program, this is the program for support of the small towns, in all these programs, Sberbank is a leading player. And 20% of our SME portfolio was formed, thanks to using this or that state support mechanism. So 80% are -- in 80% of the cases, we're using the tools that we have created ourselves.</p><p>Now there were some questions about the ecosystems. I will try to talk about the ecosystem. Any business starts with opening a company, with starting the company. Sberbank delivered a unique tool. There are no similar tools around the world. It helps a customer, a physical person of Sberbank. They can register a business or a sole trader, to become a sole trader from the comfort of their sofa. And this is a very friendly tool that was created together with the government of the Russian Federation. You can use the electronic signature on your smartphone.</p><p>How it works? You take your smartphone with an NFC reader. And after working with 2 years, after negotiating 2 years with the Apple Corporation, it is now available on Apple smartphones. It used to be on the Android software. So you put your NFC scanner to your foreign passport, and the electronic signature is generated. So you can start a company, and you can open a settlement account at Sberbank.</p><p>Now if you look at the right-hand side of the slide, 80% of the companies are -- 8% of the companies are registering through Sberbank, and it is growing. All -- many -- the majority of companies use our personal profile. And from this 8%, the conversion to the settlement accounts is 80%. So that means that if you look at the figures, like in 2016, from 100,000 because, well, every month in Russia, around 90,000 companies are registering business -- their business. And now -- and 60% of them now select Sberbank to open a settlement account, that we have affordable products, good bundles with effective tools. The registration experience is very seamless. So you don't need to go to the tax authority or the branch. It takes less than 3 days. And obviously, the most important thing is that 52% select Sberbank as the only bank for settlement. So they have no other settlement accounts in any other bank.</p><p>That means that it helps to ensure effective settlements because the settlements between the customers of Sberbank, 80% of the payments are done in 1 minute. And we have a new type of requests from our customers. When customers want to revoke the payments and the payment has been already delivered, and we are working to make sure that the payments between companies could be done in 1 second with all KYC procedures and anti-fraud procedures implemented. So instant payments, it's a very near future including for the companies.</p><p>Going to loans now. You perhaps were quite surprised in terms of the figures of the loan portfolio growth, and it is driven by the digital tools, first of all. Now first of all, the first major tool is RUB 10 million loan in 3 minutes. 1.3 million customers have preapproved credit limits, so they can benefit from this feature. So that's a large corporation.</p><p>You asked about AI technologies. These are AI technologies. These are the limits where we -- that we use that would calculate using the working capital, using the salaries information, using the settlement account information and transaction information. And we can use all this data to forecast the credit worthiness and preapprove a limit for a loan. And you can apply for a loan in 3 minutes. So you can see that the number of transactions is growing, and it's huge. And it helps us in 3 minutes to give these loans in the system that is called Sberbank Business Online.</p><p>Another large segment, there is a new segment, this is a self-employed segment. Last year, Russia started experiments in 4 regions of Russia. And now a physical person can register himself or herself as a self-employed person in the federal tax service. Now if you're self-employed, you are delivering services to the physical as persons. If you sell hats in Instagram, you can register yourself as self-employed. You can get -- send an invoice, and you will have a proper relations with your customers. And you pay only 4% of the customer. If you like, for instance, clean the windows for a company, a company can pay to you legally and you will pay only 6% of the taxes. And you can register as self-employed, and you can service your tax and you can receive all the needed information and generate the invoices in Sberbank Business Online system. This service has been -- was launched in March this year, and we have more than 200,000 self-employed using this solution. In 2020, we are planning the rollout of the solution to 19 regions. And I think that, very soon, all regions will benefit from this solution. And the potential for this segment, it's 15 million customers that can be employed legally and benefit, the tools delivered by Sberbank. And that will mean that they can do legal business. And the companies can have legal relations, proper relations with the contractors.</p><p>Now corporate cards. The corporate cards segment in Russia is, well, not that developed. And if you look at the American markets to compare it with, the business cards are used for the state paid -- payments and other things. Russia has a great potential for development. We have 40% of the market share, and we have tens of millions of people working in companies. Obviously, every employee of a company must have a corporate card perhaps not in the physical form, not in the plastic form but in their smartphone to pay for some things that the company needs. That goes for online payments, for some expenses, travel expenses and anything you can buy to work in the company. We can start with a debit card. We have credit card and travel card. The Banker awarded us as the best business in -- as the best banking business cards in CEE region. And you can see that, this year, the growth -- the income from business cards is RUB 17 billion. It used to be RUB 10 billion in 2017. So I'd like to thank our CFO for that effort -- who gave me coffee. That's the most expensive coffee I got, I guess in my life. Anyway, we see that the -- this business card line is off to a strong story. And I think that very soon we are going to have a profit of more than 50 billion in this segment.</p><p>Now talking about the medium and large segment and these AI-powered loans in 7 minutes. We talked about 3 minutes for loans up to RUB 10 million, and now you can have a loan up to RUB 2 billion in 7 minutes. That's the reality. It's working. When we talk about 7 minutes, the loans that we deliver, well, I mean there was this security and other things there. The legal structure is more difficult. And our robots, our AI solutions can analyze it all, can conclude, can contract and sign in electronic form these contracts. We have more than 100,000 limits approved for the companies. And it can only be signed in Sberbank Business Online.</p><p>Now going to the change of federal law at -- 214, finance in the residential construction with escrow. Sberbank delivered 7.6 -- 76% of the financing. This is a very high-margin finance. It's very efficient financing because we selected the best borrowers in the market. We were the first ones to give the first loan to the first ones to open the escrow accounts. And obviously, we are a -- the key player on this market. This year, our portfolio doubled in terms of the finance of the residential construction.</p><p>Agriculture is one of the quickest industries -- one of the quickest-growing industries in Russian Federation, and Sberbank is a leading institution that finances the industry. 35% of financing to agro is coming from Sberbank. We are supporting exporters through our trading arm in SberbankSwitzerland because every second ship that travels through Bosphorus with grain was financed by Sberbank. We actively work in that market, and we see great potential in that market.</p><p>Global markets, GM</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>We are very keen to see the mechanisms that we create, primarily of FX, used by the Russian commercial companies and financial institutions. The bank -- already this year, the bank has converted about $500 billion worth of deals, very importantly. In our platform we see both demand and supply. Internalization is about 70%. That means that all of these transactions have a dual effect for us. We see both the -- we cater to both the demand and supply. And just under 3 -- just under 1/3 of cases, we need to go anywhere to any external platform to close a deal. And that was obviously endorsed by all the international rankings and magazines. We are the best liquidity provider, according to Global Finance. We are the best FX provider, according to Global Finance, in Eastern Europe. And The Banker</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>the leading institutions work with us, financial institutions. JPMorgan is the largest provider of ruble liquidity for American investors and other international banks.</p><p>Exports support. It's no secret that banks that support exports are very important because they -- I mean those transactions ensure much better returns, I mean besides the traditional cash handling. FX, export support, commodity trade finance, all of those products that exporters use in their activity are highly lucrative. And this year, the bank brought up a new service, enhanced VAT recovery and enhanced banking guarantee.</p><p>You know -- and VAT is 20%. VAT is -- used to be recovered pretty long together with the federal tax service and the custom services. We filed for the recovery of VAT, together with them, together with the export. And now it's not 180 days. Now it's 7 days. This is gigantic support for the Russian business. We launched that service in the second half of the year, and we have accomplished 346 transactions for in excess of $100 billion</p><p>We develop all kinds of platforms for exporters. One of such platforms is BANKOFPARTNERS. We help companies find a partner and promote that product internationally, like -- in platforms like Amazon, eBay, et cetera. And we already saw 37,000 registered users, and 85% is the growth year-on-year. Our venue in London won the global accolade as the top digital innovator in banking technologies. We are not only supporting the finance of exports. We are supporting the logistics of -- I beg your pardon, we are supporting the mechanics of business in helping companies resolve their daily needs.</p><p>And as we pass over to the corporate business, I'd like you to see a brief video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: [Interpreted] As we speak about Sberbank Business Online, the important thing is not just we brought a third version to the market. The important fact is that we only had to spend about 6 months to develop it from scratch. And it's not just updating Facebook or Gmail. It was just facelift. If an accountant comes to work and can't make a payment, he's going to get a shout from the owner. It should be all intuitively understandable. And we think we managed to accomplish this transformation that will be in a way that would be intuitive to use. We rolled out everything in 3.5 months, and we never enlisted the help of any international vendors like IBM. This was all done by us.</p><p>Ecosystem now. We intend to support the entrepreneur throughout his business, especially in digital services. I'm going to dwell on several services. I mentioned business and cooperation.</p><p>Education and business. The question was what exactly it gives. Yes, we do provide free education in 2 formats. That is (foreign language), the Business Environment. There is about 700,000 participants of that. You can get registered and take our free business course about how the cycle works from inspiration to selling your business, what are the right ways to do all of those things. And the second very important effect is a threefold decrease in outflow of companies whose owners or employees got trained in Business Environment, (foreign language). This is obviously free for the users, but this is a very strong instrument of raising the loyalty of these customers. We are obviously the leading provider of trading. Sberbank AST, it was designed to match all the federal laws in procurement. A lot of business is transacted there. Evotor is a leader in digital cash registers, which is a key information source for the bank informing all those loan offerings. If the cash registry is working, happens what, the company is doing a spanking fine business and it can be loaned to. We are also a provider of broad products for the major retail chains. We help those companies to be served by the electronic document flow. And there's a lot of other services that I already covered.</p><p>And to promote all of those services, we have already 148 salesmen, specially trained salesmen. Because all the technologies are pretty difficult to grasp for sales managers, we are building this special vertical of sales that helps salesmen to talk with tech people on the side of the companies that we cooperate with, IT directors, commercial directors and all the other people who do the tech business in a company. We unite all those support elements behind those salesmen. There's obviously one number to call. We want to unify this, to standardize this customer experience. We put together a special CRM to promote that ecosystem. Our fintech API won an accolade last week from global banking awards as the best international decision, as the best international solution. You cannot just connect your service to Sberbank Online. You can manage subscriptions on 30 services. You can do all the things that you are accustomed to doing in your smartphones, but now that is available for customers and you don't have to run around with those bills. Or the accountant can do that in one system, and this is much more convenient.</p><p>And this is obviously a lot of money, RUB 4 billion that we won from scaling that, not just commercial companies. The banks are also served. They use a lot of banking products. The Russian and international financial institutions are prepared to buy the solutions that Sberbank developed, and we have several successful projects in this area.</p><p>On AI, I think I told you about. I'm probably going to skip the robots.</p><p>We work hard also on creating good-quality urban infrastructure. Our PPP project in Khanty-Mansiysk saw the construction of about 6 schools with PPP finance. We preserved quite a bit of forest because we decreased 4x the amount of paper that we got from our customers. You see the figures on the screen. That is highly useful for our customers and for ourselves. That speeds up our business, and that preserves the nature. And the green financing, obviously. We started supporting the companies that, for instance, manufacture aluminum the green way environmentally, efficiently. And from a bank to a digital transformation, I think that step is very, very soon to be made.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay. Thank you, Anatoly. Let's start handling questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANDREY PAVLOV-RUSINOV, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] Goldman Sachs, Andrey Pavlov. I've got a couple questions, if I may. On escrow accounts, you brushed on that topic very quickly, but this is a high-potential topic for the banking sector. Maybe not last year, but over a 3-year horizon, the overall potential might be over RUB 3 trillion. What is your assessment for next year for the lending volumes in this segment? How do you choose developers to lend to? Is it the largest developers? Do you also serve smaller developers? And the second question: What about corporate funding? As you mentioned, you have the potential to grow your market share, yet the competition in this segment is not that big. The Moscow Exchange has been launching services for direct funds placement by the corporates. What is your view of the competition and the potential in this segment?</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: [Interpreted] Thank you very much for those questions. Let's start with financing of residential properties. The reform was grandiose. If the portfolio of residential properties used to be under RUB 200 billion of RUB 13 trillion, I mean that's small change for Sberbank. The government is obviously unhappy with cases like Urban Group that went bust. Only Urban Group cost about RUB 100 billion to the government in the bailout. The potential is obviously huge. Next year, we expect a doubling of the market because the additions to the law that came out in April this year, they allowed most of the developers to maintain the old financing mechanisms. Those are going to be attrition-ed, and for the new projects, developers will obviously have to use escrow mechanisms. I can say that a lot of developers have realized that, and they use escrow financing in their advertising. We are building based on escrow-backed financing. This means that you're going to get your property on time, and you don't have any risks. That is very important. And we welcome and we work throughout the nation with developers because our expertise -- we used to have that expertise. It was the deepest expertise around. And we can pick -- we can cherry-pick the best projects in the market. And the fact that we have 76% of escrow speaks to the fact that we have been able to cherry-pick the best projects in the market.</p><p>Going back to funding. If you talk about major corporates, this is not that interesting. The bank has no problems with liquidity and what the exchange has been doing. On financing major corporates, that is not highly marginal. That's not very attractive for us. For us it's most important to work with current accounts and small business. That's our main function.</p><p>ANDREY PAVLOV-RUSINOV: [Interpreted] What about that escrow funding? Do you think you can have a figure for next year? I mean have you budgeted for that potential? Can you lend?</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: [Interpreted] I think the portfolio is about -- well, is going to double. I mean it's about -- I mean the question of how much money we're going to get in that escrow account, that's a subtle question. It might be RUB 100 billion or it might be 0. It depends on the attractiveness, on how attractive those flats are, those apartments are. I mean the good thing is that the mechanism of sales are untied of the financing. I mean regardless of how well you sell, the property is going to get stable financing from the bank. Developers used to dump 30% at the pit stage. And then they used to finance the next property at the expense of the previous, so-called [pot] financing. Now this is not available anymore.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible).</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: Well, perhaps there are 2 big products in financing. That's working capital financing and all the various derivatives of that and project financing. Project financing is pretty marginal for the bank because it's more risk fraught. The expected margin is about 2%, 3% here. Next question, Elena? And yes, and then your question, yes, Elena Tsareva.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You have 4 SMEs available. How do you...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: No. It's not SMEs. It's midsized corporates.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Midsized corporates, okay. So in this very rapid loan approval process, what -- is this available only to clients or also for new customers...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: Yes, it is, yes -- no, is it -- it's only -- available only at all clients which have already created history with our bank, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. And do you use any data sources beside your own data?</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: We don't disclose this. We use different site of data. Definitely, open source of data which are available in the market, we -- for sure, we use, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And what are those sources...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: All legal information which are available about court cases, about legal situation with the customers like recent reports, tax reports we use, this type of information.</p><p>ELENA TSAREVA, SENIOR BANKING ANALYST, BCS FINANCIAL GROUP, RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] Elena Tsareva, BKS (sic) [BCS] Global Markets. You had a slide with NPLs for the corporate small and medium business...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: [Interpreted] Our colleagues from the risks were going to show you that in detail. I skipped through that on purpose.</p><p>ELENA TSAREVA: [Interpreted] Yes, but you had a table between 2016 and '19. NPLs grew, whereas everywhere else that decreased. Are you looking for margins in the corporate business? Or...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: [Interpreted] No, that was just an organic situation. We -- understandably, a big bank shook off the crisis, and some legacy of the crisis remained in various portfolios. The real estate business used to be financed with foreign exchange loans. In oil and gas, NPLs grew a little bit. In smaller business, we improved the risk management, and that allowed us to get a better quality. We got -- we were able to use the data from additional sources, and that allowed us to make the quality of lending better. Okay, Simon then Olga.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS, MD AND DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: My question will be on the relative profitability of SME versus the large corporates. Can you give us a bit of color on how much more profitable SME is in terms of margin...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: It's very difficult to kind of compare what is relative per company or per whatever...</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: Per for the segment.</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: Per segment, current observation is that SME is 1.5x more profitable than large corporates.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: Even after the risk.</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: Yes.</p><p>OLGA VESELOVA, EQUITY BANKING ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] Olga Veselova, Bank of America. Two questions. One, the less-pleasant one, the transfer of loans, the defense loans. How did that affect the dynamics of the corporate loan portfolio? And can that affect the portfolio next year? And the proximate question: Under the law, transfer of loans requires transfer of capital. Have you addressed that requirements of the federal law? And do you intend to do that? And perhaps one more important detail. Are there any other segments where the economic rationale is not the only factor that guides Sberbank in managing the dynamics of the corporate loan portfolio? Is there anything else we don't know that might affect your situation?</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: [Interpreted] Yes, perhaps I'm going to start from the end. Our rationale, it is exclusively economical. We get paid over a -- over some term and with assurance of recoupment. Those are the 3 basic principles of finance. All the other -- all the changes that you mentioned, they are pretty much cosmetic. They will not affect the growth rates. They will not affect anything else. Those changes are insignificant.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Thank you. I think Alan had a question.</p><p>ALAN RAMSEY WEBBORN: Alan Webborn from SocGen. How much do your corporate clients pay for all these wonderful services that you're now able to offer them? I mean clearly it's extremely impressive what you're able to give them, but you've talked about education. You've talked about tax payments. You've talked about a huge suite of products, and yet right now your market share is falling. I mean I know you've explained why it's falling and the focus on profitability. I mean but where -- is this actually generating revenues? Or is this investment on the basis that you think it will produce more revenues than the market going forward? Because clearly it's significant, what you're doing, but you're not actually growing any more than the market. So...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: And then if you consider our loan business. We don't focus on the loan business. For us, it's a key business, it's commission business. And if you take our commission business, our rate of growth is above 15% every year, our CAGR on commission. It's much well above of the market. Our loan business, it's kind of supplementary business. We are not really like focused on to gain share on loans. That's I disagree with you about our share. We just don't -- it's our focus because we balance our portfolio as a bank. Retail and SME loans are much more profitable than large corporates. It's a decision we as a bank made to allocate our capital in the most efficient manner. If you come back to the services, you need to probably value those services from the both sides. If you look straightforward on some of the services, they are not really extremely profitable compared, but the churn side effect, they deliver on the reduction of churn rate. And on survival for customers, Sberbank customers survive on the market 30% longer than any one bank's customer. So we are able, for instance, same for whatever bank, attract a customer, but SME -- let's focus on SME. They live 2.7 -- 2 year and 7 months on average. But our customers, they live 4 years. That's a difference, and we gain those difference. In churn rate, we also observe it's much less than from different financial institution because we see all transaction of sorts, the whole market. And we understand the customer movements of the whole market. We observe this. That's really give a side effect on reduction of churn rate and penetration for banking product.</p><p>ALAN RAMSEY WEBBORN: So what you're saying is that the growth in fee income, which is clearly a big part of Sberbank's revenue growth, is directly correlated to the investments that you've been making...</p><p>ANATOLY POPOV: Yes, it's actually not all the time investment. We make investment into building fintech API, to build an infrastructure, not to invest ourselves to whatever company, because out of all services which I presented on my slides, some -- let's say there is a [like short distribution] included into our equation on partnership scheme. (inaudible) we share revenue with all services. And -- but the way you can connect to the services, single-sign-on principles and, or billing principles and all this, that will be our significant investment. But now we enable in 3 weeks' time to connect any service in the market which fit as a standard. It's, let's say, more or less like Apple don't invest on whatever services is represented on app store, but the engines created, gives them a chance to integrate any services they like. That's what our concept looks like.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much, Anatoly. Thank you very much.</p><p>We're inviting Madame Alymova.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>NATALYA ALYMOVA, SENIOR VP &amp; HEAD OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Yes. Mr. Morozov, thank you for the coffee. Colleagues, good afternoon. That is my first time that I speak in front of you.</p><p>I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Natalya Alymova. I'm head of wealth management. I have been working in Sberbank for 8 years. Before that, in retail business, I was working on loans and deposits. And from December last year, I started to head the wealth management block, so it's been a year that I've been working there. And I would like to tell you the current situation and the outlook for the next year.</p><p>Now what is wealth management? What is the volume of business?</p><p>Now there are 2 insurance companies, life and nonlife insurance and non-state pension fund and managing companies and insurance broker. Now assets under management are on the slide. You can see the general dynamics. I would like to explain you this diagram and the market share for this year. In terms of the contribution of wealth management in the operating profit of the group, this is where we stand. These are -- this is the forecast for 2019. It is RUB 128 billion. And these are the operational income from the businesses that I talked about.</p><p>We will still have a large concentration of the profits from the loan insurance. We are actively working with the loans that moved to digital. We are moving to digital too. We have more and more digital products, and everything that we have in non-loan insurance products are also growing. And it is here on the slide and I'm talking about the market position. The share of Sberbank asset management was growing this year. We remained leaders in all instruments. We saw the increased trusts. These are the trust funds and all the other assets. We have got some assets under management from non-state pension -- some non-state pension funds. So anyway, the picture is quite good, quite positive.</p><p>I'd like to say that this year was the year when we're focused on quality first in wealth management. We have improved our processes. A large-scale IT transformation of subsidiary companies was launched. These are the strategic companies that work in wealth management block. And as a managing company, we focus a lot on the quality of the management of the assets that we were interested with. Now here we have different types of assets and the -- its alignment with benchmark. In 2018, we did not deliver on the performance indicators that we expected. And this year, we wanted to become the leading company on the market, and we became the leading company. Balanced assets, balanced funds. And all the other -- in all the other indicators, we are doing good. We are doing better than the forecast.</p><p>Now life insurance. So I'm going to talk in detail what we -- what have we done with the -- our product range and what is going to be in the future year. We have maintained the market share. It is quite stable. Perhaps you will have some questions out the life insurance and other types of insurance. I'm going to talk about that in detail, but anyway, in a nutshell, we are leaders in this market. In our life market, we are also accounting for the life insurance for the consumer loans.</p><p>Now life -- this is a wrong slide. I am not very happy with this result. We have a flat growth here. We're not in the -- we're not very active on corporate market. We're not so present on the car insurance market, and this is a huge market. But anyway, we are going to, I'm going to expand on what have we done this year.</p><p>Non-state pension fund. Here you can see the reflection of the results of the 2018 campaign that we have rolled out. There was a transition campaign. Non-state pension fund of Sberbank lost some of their customers due to the transition campaign in 2018 because the only technology that we used was the single portal of these state services, public services. So the situation kind of deteriorated, but the deterioration is not that big.</p><p>Now I'd like to talk about the -- our key efforts. It is obvious that our major</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>is digitalization. Not all products of the block are available in Sberbank Online app, and we're going to focus on that. Currently, we are rolling out in Sberbank mobile app all our risk products. If you are our customers and if you use mobile app, on the main page you will see the insurance pane, insurance section. And in the nearest future, you will have this kind of a plus button. That means that you can open new products there, major categories: real estate, insurance, travel insurance, accident insurance, family insurance and so on and so forth. And everything would be delivered in digital mode online. Obviously everyone start with sales, but I'm from retail business, so I would like to say that obviously we are going to move all the supporting services like the settlement and all the other things that a customer wants to do with their policy. Everything is going to be moved online, but that's going to be next year.</p><p>Now car insurance. We have been discussing this topic quite extensively. We are going to make an aggregator because we do not quite believe in the fact that the car insurance can be offered to our customers on exclusive terms. There is a segment where customers are loyal to their insurance companies, so we would like to be an aggregator rather than an insurance company. In the nearest time, we will go and [allow and share] pilot projects for the obligatory car insurance, OSAGO for our employees. As I said before, the post-sales servicing and settlement, we made green corridors for small settlement figures. We do it online. We have remote settlement. For instance, we made the remote settlement opportunity that was available for those who suffered from the flood in Irkutsk.</p><p>The -- in terms of post-sales services, we have decreased it manifold -- the time for delivering the services manifold. It's still days, not hours, but anyway, we have made a lot of progress in terms of improving the quality of post-sale maintenance and services of insurance products. This project has been started this year. Next year, it's going to be completed. The majority of the wealth management products are now that's being serviced in the single information office. Now that means that we have one client number to consult, to get a service in terms of wealth management. So anyway, all the technologies that are -- that the bank is delivering for the core businesses are being offered for insurance and investment products too. This -- by this, I mean chats, call center and working with the request and queries of the customer. So everything is going to be digital driven.</p><p>The managing company this year was put on digital fully, and Sberbank life insurance there too. In the first quarter next year, 2 other companies are going to be put online.</p><p>Investments, now the upgraded investment products. We always saw the trend that happened on the market. And I would like to say that this life insurance was a very hot product. We [take] -- the investment products I'm talking about. We have launched 2 products with guaranteed yields and delivered some other interesting and promising project -- products.</p><p>Life insurance. This is something that we put on top of the agenda. We had around 35% growth. We'd not see that in terms of the increase of the volume because, remember -- since you're focused on the products that are serviced by installments, by regular payments. And more than half of the payments are done -- are delivered by these products. And this is a good story. This is a strong story, and it will support our sales in the next years.</p><p>And now these products are available in SBOL. Due to regulatory constraints, we cannot deliver them in more fully, but where it is possible, the end-to-end selling experience will be put in digital. Health care services like checkups, second opinion, telemedicine were integrated in insurance and investment products. As any business, we want to increase the value of our products and to increase the frequency of communicating with customers. The managing companies decided to deliver additional -- the ability to purchase additional units and the possibility to view all the situation with the investments online. Now next year, we are going to have many new insurance products. And even the range that we have right now, like the property [insurance] and other products, are going to be -- the range is going to increase. The risks -- the risk range is going to be increased. And the -- we are going to focus on our VIP customers that do not want our out of the shelf products. These products are going to be more tailored.</p><p>Now sport insurance, sport-related insurance, in Q1, is going to be available in SBOL. Our company is using Sberbank IDs, so it's a very seamless experience.</p><p>Now animal insurance; POS insurance -- because you asked about POS lending to Alexander Vedyakhin, we're going to have POS insurance; anyway, many other products that are going to be delivered offline and online too. Car insurance; now I have mentioned that we were quite silent there. OSAGO and KASKO, based on the aggregator, in the first half of next year are going to be offered to our customers by us as an aggregator. The price is going to be the same for the customers, so they can go directly to the insurance company or to us. The price will be the same. And this is a very in-demand story. This is a good story for the customers of the bank and for the (inaudible). This is a basic need that was not -- that we did not cater for. What are we going to do with the license, I don't know. Well, as for the OSAGO, not, because there are regulatory problems. As for KASKO, the voluntary car insurance, maybe. We are inviting top 10, top 12 companies. We have negotiated with everyone, so we are basically ready to launch.</p><p>Now as I have said before, my goal is 75% of servicing and supporting -- services should migrate, be migrated to Sberbank Online. We know that putting one button is not enough. This is a huge experience. I have an experience on delivering these products online. I worked in retail. And we are going to use these expertise and skills for these new markets.</p><p>Talking about the investments. Now the -- we have a lot of products. The product range is growing. It is going to be for all segments. It's going to be diverse for all segments, but we think that the long-term savings insurance is a very promising product. Now voluntary pensions, we are going to pilot it in SBOL in the nearest -- in just several days. And you have pensions, investments and insurances that are in digital. We'll be -- you will be able to register for that in SBOL. All the other services will be delivered there.</p><p>And personal finance model. This is a very interesting story, a very promising story. I tried to look at the basic stuff. They are not in Sberbank, yet the industry is full of these products right now. So we wanted to raise awareness of our customers in terms of they need to save more. So the analytics of the spending trends, customer portfolio, we want to kind of show these all to raise the awareness of our customers so that they have a full picture of their finances. And perhaps they would have more products. Now they would buy more products and they will have a kind of a helicopter view of their portfolio, of their lifestyle and their financial activities.</p><p>Now I have put this slide because it is hard to estimate the income of this business in Sberbank. These are the general figures, but to calculate it properly, you need to look at several items on the budget. Next year, we are going to be put in the segment reporting of the group, and you will be able to see that in the reports. I'm not going to dwell in detail on that. If you ask a question, I'm going to handle that in detail.</p><p>And perhaps the final slide, on the prospects on how we see the market developing. It's a pretty simple story. Right now, even the -- even versus the developing markets, all the penetration indicators wherever you look are pretty low.</p><p>Retail mass investors are only coming to the market, and we expect these people to have completely different requirements. They are used to make a deposit, manage a deposit online; and we need to be able to meet those. Advanced investors, paradoxically though it might seem, will not be as demanding. And to make this business big, it needs to change, like we are used to seeing in Sberbank, like we are used to seeing the banking business to be digital.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. And this is the last talk before the coffee break. Before we adjourn, let's ask with the questions to the speakers.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Thank you very much for the presentation. That is very important for us, yes. What about that future, actually? We've got, how much, RUB 27 trillion of deposits? People are thinking that some of those are going to go into other products. Are you discussing that tendency in Sberbank? What do you see over 3- to 5-year horizon? How much of those money, of that money might go into wealth, RUB 1 trillion, RUB 2 trillion, RUB 3 trillion? Do you think it's going to be the same margins as with deposits? Or it's going to be different deposits, it's going to be different returns for the bank.</p><p>NATALYA ALYMOVA: [Interpreted] Well, first off, I think we need to look at a customer in a wholesome way, yes. Deposits and investment products must be treated the same. Customer demands, customer readiness, investment profile might all suggest different investment tracks. Sometimes Sberbank, we have a lot of aging customers. We've got a lot of deposits, [done] deposit types and that's what they're going to get. The wealth industry has answered the question of where that sensitivity boundary is. Developing markets, when the deposits transitioned 3.5% threshold, saw a pretty dramatic migration of customers from 3.5% deposits to wealth management, but those customers are probably going to go and diversify their portfolios at some point. It's important for us to make the investment experience good. That's why we are keenly following the residential insurance policies. That's why we are controlling rigorously, we are monitoring the cooling periods rigorously. We are verifying that the customers are actually liking, that they bought. Are we seeing an outflow? No. Are we seeing an increase? Yes. Let's going to see what happens next year.</p><p>ANDREY KLAPKO, SENIOR BANKING ANALYST, GAZPROMBANK (JOINT STOCK COMPANY), RESEARCH DIVISION: [Interpreted] Andrey Klapko from Gazprombank. You described a considerable lineup of products. Could you rank those products by margin through all the channels. Where do you see the margins in jeopardy and perhaps due to tight competition? And what lines of business do you think are going to grow next year?</p><p>NATALYA ALYMOVA: [Interpreted] Well, let's talk about margins, first. Saving life insurance is obviously a high-margin product, and credit insurance, perhaps something else. The world trend is mediation is increasingly -- is decreasingly lucrative. Agency fees are going to go down, and that will probably increase the customer value. As for growth, I expect it to be 15% to 12%, we're going to sell in digital channels. And given the fact that we are launching pretty much from 0 in most product categories, I can see sizable potential there. That is about risk, insurance, investment products and all the lineup elements that we can put into digital. Yes, that's pretty much it. Okay, more questions? I'm ready, yes, yes. I'm not biting. I'm not biting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] My question is about the product that is in particular need of private investors that are in the market for the first time, ETF, exchange-traded funds. Where are you in terms of launching that ETF products? Understandably, this is a very young product in Russia. It's probably going to take off when you wrap your heads around that in terms of great scale. And the second question, your initiative on personal financial management. How far along do you think you are in offering robo advisory to customers? But not just for investment but as broad financial management. And how much upside is there?</p><p>NATALYA ALYMOVA: Yes. Let's have the first question. We've got the first unit funds, ETF funds. And there are billions. Not that I'm entirely happy with that, but I do believe in those exchange-traded funds. We all read the [great boggle], and we know that we are all going to be there. Yes, this market is going to grow, and we're going to be heavily involved in that. We have the products, and they're all going to be in SBOL in the first quarter. Robo, we are doing this together with CIB. We are going to be offering those to our customers. As for how far we're going to go, how far we're going to depart from the investment story, probably not, but it's probably going to be about more investment. How capable are we going to be about offering certain situation-based savings? All the tools are there, and we would like to implement them. I mean the targets, the budgets, the lot.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you, Natalya. And right now, we are adjourning for 10 minutes. I suggest we spend 10 minutes on coffee, and then we reconvene for the next session. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] We are continuing with our event. And the next speaker is David Rafalovsky, the CTO of the bank. He is going to tell us about the current status of technological transformation, the development of our platform. The presentation is going to start in Russian and probably going to go into English, whatever the speaker finds more convenient. If you don't have translation sets, please tell us. We're going to help you find them.</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY, SENIOR VP, HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY BLOCK &amp; CTO, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Good morning, dear colleagues. I will try not to dwell on the things that you probably have heard of. I'm going to dwell on the newer things about our development.</p><p>We have a big technological team, over 38,000 people, 350 centralized systems. And given our customer base, it's understandable that we are daily processing a lot of transactions.</p><p>In every tech presentation, there's generally a horrible slide. This is my version of it. This actually is the architectural diagram of an insignificant part of our architecture, probably from 9 years ago. Just imagine, if this can be -- if this is to be expanded, it is pretty impossible to live in such an architecture. It might be interesting but not productive from all the viewpoints. So we decided that can't and will not live like that, and we decided to invest into our digital platform.</p><p>We pretty often use -- in public presentations, we pretty often use a slide. We call it, lovingly, the pie, the layered cake. You can see the channels, the products. I'm not going to dwell on that. But there are things that are strategic in nature in this layered cake. The first is here, #9, it's called SberWorks. That's when you leave an organization with a lot of engineers and developers, it is logical to understand how productive they are. And for the next -- and for the past 2 years, probably one of the biggest investments that we made was a single development environment. We call it the SberWorks. And we're often asked the question, \"How do you know that it's not just works and files but does it productively?\" That was one of our most important strategic investment is to achieve that.</p><p>One historic perspective to share. You have been hearing about the platform for a long time, one way or another. So we see the story of our platform, the story of our tech transformation in 3 phases. In the run-up to 2017, we went through a complex and revolutionary transformation that was about centralization. Thousands of systems we got centralized. In 2018, the new platform -- we started developing the platform earlier, but in 2018, there was a big breakthrough in the platform, we launched our private cloud. And most of our applications became cloud-ready. And as I told you, we have started investing into unified development environment that was called SberWorks. In 2019, the basic platform elements were all launched as an industrial operation. And the platform became not just a reality, it became a dependence. It became the core foundation of our business plans and operating success. And until 2020, we intend to transition 80% of customer transactions into the platform.</p><p>I drew your attention to one of the elements of the platform, SberWorks. Now I'd like to highlight the 2 other as important elements. That's what we are already operating on an industrial basis. That's UFS or unified front-end system. I'm not going to read the slides. We take great pride in what we have built. This is a cloud-native multichannel architecture. It is in production. Hopefully, you use Sberbank one way or another. And you are already, if you are using Sberbank, you already are using one of these. And 8 products, the first 8 products, some of them completely new, are already on that platform, and they are operated on an industrial basis.</p><p>Let me tell you why this outcome is important. It's not technology for the sake of technology that we invested in. We write much less code, that's important, 50% less on average than the old paradigm equivalent. And probably, the time to market is the most important metric. We always measure our success not in terms of, \"We had an idea and we implemented it.\" We measure the time to implementation. It might be an existing product or a new product. It was about how soon can we take it to the customers. We see 7x improvement on average. Sometimes it's 8x to 10x in some products.</p><p>As I've said, we have a very large tech team. The most recent statistic is, I think about 19 -- oh, it was about 1,900 squads without overlapping. They are developing in parallel on the platform. Why did we start building it? Because we were able to deploy a lot of products into industrial deployment and do that -- and that was possible in parallel.</p><p>Historically, and this is still a very frequent occurrence in the market, not just in banking, people generally plan capacity using this approach. They use the utilization of the product. They appreciate that there will be some peaks or some generated holidays, and they buy capacity licenses for that peak. Now what happens when that peak is not there? In our old paradigm, nothing used to happen. The equipment was there. It cooled -- it warmed the air, it cooled the air. But that was a good model for operating in like 1985. We don't work like this anymore. So we aggressively pushed into cloud, and we take great pride in what we accomplished. In November, 80% of all the capacity in Sberbank was granted in our private cloud. That is materially improving our utilization. Utilization has grown about 4x, not 4%, 4x. And then from the perspective of the internal customer, if the customer needs capacity, we give it in minutes and not in months as it used to be. This is not planned. This is happening. This is reality. This is our new reality.</p><p>Here's another element. We've kind of strewn the history of our platform development across multiple slides. A very interesting integration element. It's called Synapse. That is our corporate bus. I don't know what the Russian version is. That's the modern ESB, enterprise service bus. Our architectural solutions are increasingly drifting towards micro services. Communications between micro services are increasingly more important for the final product. We built our own solution. And the latency of this platform is 50x better than the commercial solutions that we used to operate.</p><p>The fundamental topic for us, we are working in the paradigm of best of both worlds. We are not willing to abandon the R&amp;D dollars that the Western companies invest into their products. Yet we do not want to be fully dependent on, I don't know, sanctions or product development pursued by other companies. We selectively use either one or the other. And very often, we have a choice inside our platform, open source solutions or proprietary solutions, commercial solutions. Achieving that is difficult because generally, when an architectural decision is made, you are taking either one path or the other. We decided that we are going to be doing it slightly differently just because we want to maximize R&amp;D -- the use of R&amp;D dollars spent in the world.</p><p>I told you about SberWorks. That is our cycle. It was drawn linearly from idea to testing, deployment and plugging into the operations and then monitoring, but this is obviously a cycle. I just wanted to tell you how we measure the success of our development cycle. But first off, everything that we write is available for reuse, 100%. There's not a component that would be developed by 1 squad of the 2,000 out there that another squad would not be able to use, reuse. And we measure the DSI or CSI of our developers. It's important because there's fight for talent worldwide, especially in the Russian market. The good engineer has a choice of where to continue his career. We want to -- we want them to want to stay in Sberbank. One of the meaningful reasons why they want to stay is that we give them a very productive, easy-to-use and developing development tool. Mr. Gref keeps saying that 84% is not 100%, but this is pretty, pretty high as an indicator. And we take, again, pride in that.</p><p>Let me tell you a little bit about the data. When I started working in Sberbank about 2 years ago -- again, this is a pretty standard story, but I'm going to share it nonetheless, we used to have these data scientists. We still have them. Pretty much any big organization has them. And I asked them, \"When you come to work, what exactly do you do? What percentage of your time do you pursue your core activity like analysis models, et cetera?\" And they said, \"When we have a lot of data, that's okay. We do something. We don't do much when the data is raw or we lack data.\" So we decided to address this problem. Address them in what way? When you entered, dear colleagues, you saw the light that was on. Has anyone asked the question, how did we get the electricity there? What was used, the heat power plant, nuclear power plant to put this lighting on? No. We come to work. We come home. There is a switcher. The light is on when you switch it. We want to have the same with data because data is our electricity. You cannot find electricity when you come to work. You need to do what you are paid for. And what we call data factory, it is our internal in-house power plant that does very challenging and complicated things related to data and that make data available and useful. In the fourth quarter, we were able to get 4 hours to get the subscription for data. An analyst has an idea. He wants to test some hypothesis to develop a model. He needs data, and he gets the data in around 2 hours irregardless of the volume of the data required.</p><p>Cloud-native. When I talked about the platform, and in 2018, I said that the majority of our applications are cloud-ready, and that is so. But cloud-ready is kind of an intermediary step in our journey to become cloud-native. I wanted to explain to you why is that important. For instance, you -- imagine you have a team. 10,000 people. All are very talented engineers. You pay them huge salaries, and they go to work and make decisions. They make decisions on how to scale, how to monitor, how to implement scalability. It's not important whether the decisions are wrong or not. Maybe they would be wrong. Maybe all of them would be wrong. But since it is 10,000 of them, it kind of -- you kind of have analogy to anarchy. And cloud-native, why we have underlined the word auto here, automatic. We want the cloud to make this decision automatically once and for all and the engineers not to make all the decisions every day. They should concentrate on the business logic and other things. And why is that important for us? Because availability and monitoring and scalability are great -- are things that we do great. But we want to do it once, to make the decisions related to these things once. So cloud-native, for us, is a target architecture structure and strategy irregardless of the domain we're working them out -- we're working in.</p><p>AI cloud and Kristofari. I think many of you have heard that we have launched the most powerful supercomputer in Russia. It is the 29th supercomputer in the world. We were not trying to position ourselves to be like on the 29th place or 31st place. That was not important. But if you have resolved the problem with data, you have to make some applications on that. And our resolution of the problem with the data was, for us, to most efficiently use the AI algorithms. So data, that's important. And compute, that's the second pillar. We need a lot of compute. And Kristofari is our main ingredient in this journey. This is some background information. We took one standard model that we developed for ourselves, what is in the following mode. We built our own infrastructure, and we taught the model -- trained the model in 2 weeks. We can use some popular cloud provider, Russian providers or international providers, so that's going to be 1 day to train a model. And for Kristofari, you see it's even lower than that. It dramatically changes the time to train the model.</p><p>Now I'm going to the end of my presentation. I would say there is no plan B. There is no plan B that -- like there is a digital platform and plan B with some other platform. No. All our business plans across the bank and across the ecosystem as well are based on 1 state-of-the-art and thought-through digital platform. And it would be quite strange for us to use this product only for ourselves and to offer to the market some other things. No. Obviously, that is not so. We suggest -- we offer to the market the same platform that we use ourselves. So you come to my family, I would give you the same food that I give to my family. The same situation is here. For the bank, for the members of the ecosystem, for our customers, for our partners, it is going to be one platform.</p><p>And in conclusion, I'd like to share our aspiration or goal. We compare ourselves with others quite often, and there are good reasons for that. We compare ourselves with Google, Amazon and Microsoft because they do great and useful and user-friendly products. And we obviously want it to be like Sber, like Sberbank. Google is great, but we want people to say like Sber. And there are more and more high-tech products that are appearing in our ecosystem. And this like Sber means that this is the best product in Russia and perhaps in the world. And we are very proud of that. So thank you very much.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] And a small Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much, David. Now your questions, colleagues.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Olga, please.</p><p>OLGA VESELOVA: [Interpreted] Olga Veselova, Bank of America. Very good and useful part of the presentation. Several years ago, Sberbank disclosed the following figures in terms of IT costs in the structure of all costs and maintenance, new and disruptive breakdown of the costs related to IT. I know it's very hard to calculate that, but perhaps you have some updated figures on that. And secondly, your expectations in terms of IT costs growth for the next year.</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: [Interpreted] Well, I don't have it. I think we have it in our financial presentation, yes. So I mean we have technology ambitions. Unfortunately, our developers do not want to come to us to work for free, although we have a great platform. The IT costs are going to increase, but it is going to be proportionate to our ambitions. I won't expect some dramatic growth that would be inadequate to the growth of our business.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. [Andrey], please. Not using the microphone. Still not using the microphone, but the interpreters will try to interpret something, maybe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] What else do you need apart from Kristofari? Or are you going to use the same scale and in terms of -- you have resolved all your technology issues.</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: [Interpreted] Well, I would say there are 2 areas for development, for improvement. First of all, it's not a technology problem but the use of technologies. We have very aggressive and challenging plans to migrate our core business to this platform. We started it. We have a platform. It's working in production mode. But it's a Ferrari. And you need to change the engine in this Ferrari, yet this Ferrari is still going. You're driving it. So it's not the problem of the -- whether the engine is good or not. No, I cannot just stop the bank and say, \"Okay. Guys, can we just stop everything, and I would just migrate it quickly? Everything will be great afterwards.\" So no. We're continuing to develop the business and we're still migrating to the platform.</p><p>You remember Y2K. There were 2 different approaches to Y2K. So there were 2 organizations. One -- types of organizations. Some organizations said that, \"The world is changing. We're stopping the business to cater for Y2K.\" There were other organizations who said, \"Yes, there is a problem. But since a patient is already on my operating table, I won't be able to migrate right now. So I will continue to operate and migrate at the same time.\" And we're for the second category.</p><p>I would like to say 3 products -- I mean 3 products are totally new that are on this platform. So we don't have any technical challenges in our platform. It's not our problem. It's our opportunity. The challenge, though, is to migrate to this platform as quickly as possible. And the bulk of our business will be migrated to this platform by 2021. And another thing that I wanted to say, and the underlying -- this is an important part of our strategy, something that we do for ourselves, we sell it for the market. And I think this is an untapped potential that we want to develop. Platform business, cloud business are good opportunities, are great opportunities.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. More questions. Simon?</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: You said that 80% is going to migrate to the new platform. So what isn't going to migrate? And will it migrate at some point? I mean what kind of businesses just won't migrate?</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: Remaining 20%?</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: What kind of businesses aren't able to migrate at this point of time?</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: This is not -- we're -- it's not 80-20 in terms of businesses will or will not migrate. Everybody will migrate. But there are a priority of migrations based on scale. So this is a cheaper platform to run. As you would expect, we'll take the most expensive transactional old platforms and migrate them first. So whatever will be left, it's the whatever is not as expensive operationally as the, comparatively speaking, other products. But everything will migrate. We're just not creating a forced march. Every -- the Earth will continue to rotate in the same direction if we migrate a little later. But what's important to us is to migrate what's the expensive transactional operation to a new, cheaper, more efficient platform.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: So can you give us an example of what doesn't need to be migrated right away? Or...</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: Is Herman Gref up to you? No. I'm not prepared to share our detailed plans for 2023. Just not -- we're not at that level. It might be better. The hint, it might be better than 80%.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Any more questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Osman, Wood Research.] What's your edge on hiring IT talent, which I understand is key to your development? What are -- I assume this is more than about offering high salaries for your IT people. What's your wedding proposition?</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: Thank you for your question, very near and dear to my heart. We want people to want to be here. And the #1 reason people join Sberbank and Group Sber is because of the size of the problem they have an opportunity to solve. Very infrequent an engineer has an opportunity to work on problems of this magnitude. It's just interesting. So that's one. Two, our investment in SberWorks, our investment in the environment for developers, investment in boot camp for new -- kind of new hires, that's why they come to us. And the last ingredient, and I wish I can take credit for it, it's not just my -- although I believe in it, this is kind of a DNA of the entire organization. We believe in studying. We believe in investment in your personal development. And it's bidirectional investment. So we need to give you, as an employee, an opportunity to study. You have to actually do something and take on this opportunity. So as a developer, as an engineer, with ever-increasing pace of technology innovation, it's even more critical. We invest, I bet more than anybody in financial industry, in giving employees ability to continue to advance themselves from our corporate university, to books we translate, to classes, courses. So that's our edge.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Thank you. Next question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: This is [Jan] with Wood &amp; Company. So I don't come from an engineering or IT background, a note of caution. And I'm just trying to visualize what you can do with 38,000 IT people that other Eastern European banks cannot do. Because 38,000 people is probably bigger than a couple of big Eastern European banks combined. So could you explain to us what can you do that, let's say, Garanti in Turkey cannot do or MONETA or Pekao? I mean just help us visualize what exactly gives you the edge over regional banks?</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: Oh, it's not so much an edge. It's a reality of this market and our position in this market. We have almost 100 million clients. Most of them rather actively use our digital channels. Actually, if you look at DAU of our digital channels, it's significantly higher comparably to even larger banks. So that infrastructure, the product infrastructure, the IT infrastructure, the support infrastructure of that concurrent load takes that many people, and that's sophisticated with a system to support. That's one. Two -- to support and develop. Two, we are -- I mean we did not build this platform only for banking services. That's, I think, also rather unusual. Very few Eastern European banks, as far as I know, declare their strategy to be not only in banking but in other platforms. Our data model is not limited, for example, to financial products. I can model anything. I can add anything. It's designed this way. So if we look at the number of people, it's proportional, I believe, to our investment in IT and how many products based on having significant IT [quotient] in their DNA, I would say we don't have enough.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Thank you. We'll take our next question from [Mikhail], you, again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. I wanted to ask a question. When you actually approached, let's say, the new technological advance, the new system or whatever the new feature which you wanted to roll out, how you assess the economic impact of it on whatever actually makes sense to actually to build the new systems to migrate, what are the key metrics which you -- or perhaps the IRR thresholds, which you have in mind when you calculate the economic effect of all this technological transformation?</p><p>DAVID RAFALOVSKY: We don't operate on that level, I'm afraid. Let me explain what it means. We're not building a system and then calculate ROI and creating a system. We don't believe in technology for technology's sake. We do it for product. We do it for product or customer. So either customer has a problem, which we need to solve, and where as kind of LTV-related benefit, where IT is a cost of increasing LTV, lifetime value of the client; or whereas a business opportunity. It's a product question, not IT question. It's not system question. The whole how much system costs, I don't know what system is anymore. We're going to world of micro services and cloud where it's a question of product creation, not IT or run costs of that. So we're -- it's LTV or product-related. This is what we typically use to make the investment decision.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Any more questions? So we are wrapping up. David, thank you very much.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] And we are welcoming our next speaker, Lev Khasis, First Deputy Chairman of the Board. He's going to open a session of presentations about the ecosystem of Sberbank.</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH, FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; COO, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Good afternoon, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. It is my great pleasure to welcome you here and to share with you our developments in the ecosystem. And I'll be happy to answer your questions. So I will start.</p><p>We think that many years ago, when Gref became -- began starting to use the word business ecosystem, it was a totally new notion in Russia. No one knew what it was. Russia is no exception, you know. The term ecosystem appeared several years, several decades ago, but for many years, it was only used by researchers and economists. And only recently, the interest of this notion and term has been growing. If you now go to Google and enter \"business ecosystem\" in the search pane, you will find 150 million articles and discussions that discuss this issue. There are several concepts and visions. Dozens of thousands of companies around the world announced that they were building an ecosystem. And Russia is no exception. This hype can be felt in Russia, too. Yet there is a difference, a small difference in the overwhelming majority of the countries. They were not able to build their own ecosystems because they were invaded by the ecosystems that came from China or the U.S. For instance, in Europe, I really cannot remember one European-based ecosystem. So that market is dominated by American ecosystem.</p><p>So if you talk about Russia, this is kind of a house race of the ecosystems has only started. These are just some companies that either publicly announced that they are building an ecosystem, or perhaps they have not announced that, but de facto, you can see some new elements of the ecosystem that are being built by them. I put them in alphabetic order. And it is really hard to understand who is going to be more successful or less successful, but we can see that after -- like yesterday and the day before yesterday, we saw 2 -- our competing banks announce about the creation of their super apps. There was a hot debate started, like who is the first one. After that, Yandex and Mail. Ru came out saying, \"What exactly are you talking about? We have had super apps for a long while now.\" I think this dialogue is meaningless because Facebook wasn't the first social network, nor was Instagram, and the outcome of this competition is probably too early to sum up. I think we should do that in a couple of years.</p><p>Let's talk about the philosophy that underpins that. Any big organization will probably have a certain set of advantages, strong suits, targets, and it has its own logic, its own philosophy, its own goal-setting methods in building the ecosystem. All the goals will be different. When Sberbank announced its strategy of building an ecosystem at the Investor Day in 2017, we set out in great detail what our rationale was, why we intend to do that. I'm not trying to reconstruct, reenact that presentation again here. Just to mention the key points. In light of our competitive positioning in the market and the long-term vision for our shareholders, we think we should not be defensive. We should not wait while all the applicants and pretty much everyone wishes to bite a certain piece of the turf that we are in, where we are earning money, where we are serving our customers. We want to go forward. And instead of being on the defensive, we would like to go on the offensive and find new markets and services that we would offer to our customers. That was the rationale.</p><p>We want -- we must use our strong sales. That's our brand. That's the #1 brand in Russia. And certainly, by a large margin, this is the brand trusted the most by the people more than any other brand. We need to use our tech capability, our relationship with individuals and companies alike. And at the end of the day, we need to use our branch network that, in our view, has great value. We already see that this branch network can advance us in a big way in terms of selling our nonbanking products because our experience of promoting our own banking products tells us that they began to dominate the market, became the most attractive in the market because we were able to educate our customers in using those digital products. We were able to help upload those products and use those products. So our offline network is one of the very important drivers in advancing our digital products. And naturally, all the analysts fell into 2 camps. One camp said that, \"You are right in doing that.\" They were great supporters. The other camp said, \"You are going crazy. Why exactly do you need that? Your proposition that tech giants are going to encourage in your turf is complete rubbish. No one is willing to go into the domain of the regulated business, the heavily regulated business that banking is.\" So I would like to thank the analysts that do understand our rationale and support us.</p><p>And here's a couple of points addressed to the other camp. Now first off, we see that big companies, big tech companies are increasingly experimenting and running pilot projects with regulated businesses, the other things that include regulated businesses. They are encroaching on this turf. Also, the regulated business, the things that are within this regulatory pail, is increasingly commoditized. Marketplaces emerge. Commercial marketplaces emerge. The initiative of the Russian Central Bank is to create this marketplace. Everyone is trying to become the intermediary between the regulated banks and their customers. So the main money is not the money within this pail of regulated turf. They are the hard money. The margins are going to fall there, and those margins are going to fall not just due to macro indicators but due to the cost of access to customers through nonbanking solutions, lifestyle solutions, service solutions. That is going to increase, but continuously. So if we think of our future, even over the midterm and hopefully over the long term, we must think about how we can earn the money, how we can serve our customers not inside this regulatory pail, but we need to go beyond into the adjacent territories.</p><p>I could say a few words about the rationale that drives us into non-banking businesses. We are not building brick factories. We are not producing sausages. We would like to establish businesses that are either aggregators or marketplaces. Those will allow us not only to not compete with our mass customers, but they will allow us to cooperate and help in developing the small and medium enterprises. We see the importance of those services for people and companies alike. We see the ability of these businesses to digitize right now and right here. Some of these businesses are telecoms. They are already digital. And further digitization is not as fast as it used to be happening 10 or 20 years ago. And when we are looking at the businesses like e-commerce and food, those markets are huge. That's what we could see. And the speed of digitization is really, really huge. And this is what sets us our priorities. But then again, this is one of the examples to illustrate our rationale. We are not trying to be exhaustive in describing the entire picture of the ecosystem that we're building with this example.</p><p>Now in our view, there's a material difference between the multi-industrial holding that owns a lot of companies across various industries and an ecosystem. We think the most important difference is in that an ecosystem creates a seamless customer experience. The ecosystem uses certain uniting technological marketing and other elements, and these elements rationalize the cost of customer acquisition. The lifetime value of relating to customers is increased in that, and this is the strength of the ecosystem. Importantly, very importantly, the ecosystem is not something built near Sberbank. Sberbank is an inherent and integral part of the ecosystem. And ecosystem is essentially our new business model that allows us to expand considerably what you would call a total addressable market. We are offering not just banking products but non-banking products as well to our customers, and not necessarily do these products have to be offered by companies that we own. We think we have a great potential to relate to pretty much the entire market in offering the best products to our customers.</p><p>Why are we sometimes buying a second of those businesses? Well, again, to create additional value for our shareholders. If you imagine our customer base and our capabilities, you can easily understand that any business that can, together with us, promote our services for our customer base, that business will, by definition, become a unicorn. And if we don't have any upside -- any equity upside, that's going to be charity, a charitable effort to enrich the shareholders of those businesses or target businesses. We have shareholders of our own, so we think about those first.</p><p>And very importantly, this approach is about partnership. We pretty much never buy 100% ownership of companies. We do have certain greenfield developments, but they are the minority. The absolute majority of our deals are the deals of partnership. And this is our philosophy: We do not wish to have a scorched earth. We wish to have a great multitude of partners that work with us. And even on the list of companies that are one way or another part of the construction ecosystem, there's a lot of companies either in a JV with us, in a joint activity with us, or we are talking about that in one way or another. Mail.ru and Alexander Mamut, that is our partner with Mamut; AFK Sistema; Yandex; even Gazprombank, we have joint businesses with; even Tinkoff, that became the first bank that got connected to our P2P transfer system. Now this shows the openness of our approach for everyone to be able to work with us. Very importantly, a lot of our subsidiaries also have the ability, just at the drop of a hat, to start relating not just with us but with other financial institutions, for instance, this very successful subsidiary of ours, Evotor. It's actively working with about 80% of the 20 largest banks in Russia. And this is wonderful because this significantly expands their ability to develop their own business.</p><p>Let me give you a summary of what we have accomplished already over the past couple of years. Despite the ecosystem's strategy having been adopted in 2017, the preconditions were in existence pretty much since 2012. And since then, we invested in 25 companies. Most of those companies were created as a greenfield. We did not buy those. We created them from scratch. You will see that in net assets, the share of funds earmarked on that is pretty much a margin of error despite being a sizable figure in absolute terms. Now please note that we only note -- only mention here non-financial companies. We have a lot of financial companies. They are not in these figures.</p><p>Now let me tell you several things about our approach to M&amp;A. Again, there is this myth in the market. I actually tried that test. I put this question to people, \"How many companies do you think Sberbank bought?\" The first answer off the top of that had -- people say, in light of the overall noise, 200 companies, maybe 300. That is obviously a myth. Since 2012, the total of companies that we bought, excluding the venture investments via the venture fund, the accelerator, the total we bought -- we invested in 10 companies. And that includes financial and nonfinancial companies alike. Yandex. Money was the investment of 2012. That said, in 2019, we entered 4 new industries. That was an eventful year. Importantly, to make those 4 decisions, we had analyzed over 200 various targets, and we approached the M&amp;A through -- with great discipline. And then in the absolute majority of ideas, we adopt a negative decision. Four out of 200, that is a good indicator, showing that we are pretty open to looking at a lot of opportunities while deciding only on the opportunities that meet all of our criteria, and you see those on your slide.</p><p>That is a lot of a difference. That sets us apart from international examples. We're not trying to chase those other benchmarks. I'd like to draw your attention that a lot of other ecosystems that is on everyone's lips, they'd buy companies by the hundreds, sometimes a company a week. And we are quite far from them. We're not trying to chase them, to be sure. I think that if you talk about large industries, we formed the perimeter that we are interested in. Yes, there might be some reorganizations and attempts to order. We might think that some businesses are not growing. We might think there's some business that aren't growing fast enough. We might sell something, and we might enter something else. But I do not think that some new -- major new industry is going to come up that I would like to enter with some huge investments to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. And if that is under $100 million or under $150 million, those cases are possible. But in light of the scale of our activity, that is entirely possible.</p><p>We will certainly be focusing, in particular, on the projects that we already have. And that we are going to dwell on a bit later but still today. Very importantly, our M&amp;A strategy mandates us to be a partner in a leading player right away and has a whole number of advantages. But in many cases, we are trying to enter the industry via the #2 or #3 player because we think that certain technological improvements multiplied by the capability that we are contributing will achieve us the leadership for a lot less as opposed to paying this enormous premium for the #1 leader in the market. And here are some non-leaders in the Russian market that we think might vie for the pole position over the next 2 to 3 years, maybe 5. They are here, but we'll be working actively on that.</p><p>Very importantly, and I mentioned that before, an ecosystem is only possible when all those businesses are not disjointed and disunited, but united into something: seamless customer experience; single standards of, say, cybersecurity; and many other things. For us, we identified 25, maybe 26 uniting elements of the ecosystem. In some subsidiaries, they all got introduced 100%. Some are only beginning to introduce them. But in the 2020, we are aiming to make all these ecosystem companies to use those uniting elements that will boost the growth that we are aiming for.</p><p>This is an incomplete brand list of our companies and services. A lot of names here are not matching the names of the service. Sometimes a company owns more than one brand, but then you are getting an idea from the slide of the very broad gamut of brands and other recognizable services in various domains of life of both our individual private customers and corporate customers that are, again, our clients.</p><p>Let me talk a few -- say a few words about the priorities of ours for 2020. As we think about our customers, we simply have to pay attention to the most important customer segment that are state or municipal outfits. And here, our very important priority is to enter that market. And we understand this market to be the various services for the state and municipal enterprises and the services for individuals and entities -- providing the public services to individuals and entities, services that used to be provided by the government. So we're liaising actively with all levels of government. We have a very interesting lineup for them: IT services, cloud services, what David mentioned, the IT platform. There's some back-office functions, accounting, bookkeeping, various other business administration services, cybersecurity, AI, public procurement, biometrics. All of those services we would like to actively promote among the companies that operate for the organizations that operate in this segment.</p><p>And also, we are keen to remember that the Digital Economy government program designated Sberbank as the center of competence in 2 critically important areas. That's AI and cybersecurity. We are paying particular attention to that. David mentioned the public cloud of artificial intelligence that's going to be available for the entire nation. And we are looking at this as a major financial function and a business. Now here, I would like to say a few words about our individual customers. I tried to make it as simple as possible. And the most important area of working with this customer segment can be described with these 4 things: breadth, circuses, mobility and assurance and security -- safety and security. That does not mean that there are no other areas that are important for our retail customers, but these are the pillars really.</p><p>So let's talk about this breadth. This industry is radically changing. I made an experiment once. Let's -- let me make this experiment again. We have the majority of men here. Yet there are some women, too. Ladies, could you raise a hand if you wear something that you sewed yourself? No hands risen. You sewed yourself? Are you wearing something? I think that 50 or 60 years ago, if I asked this question, there would be a lot of women who would raise their hands. That means that the clothing industry in this 50, 60 years has changed radically. And I know that -- well, I mean, obviously, there are some amateurs. But if I ask some men, do -- can you use a bow and arrows? Some men say, \"Yes, I can do that. I can hunt with bow and arrows.\"</p><p>But anyway, everything has changed. Sewing at home is a hobby really. The majority of people buy ready-made clothes in the shops. We think that the same trend might happen in everything related to food. And if I ask you how many of you can cook? Well, men and women would raise their hands, and I would raise my hand. I know how to cook, but this is going to change. And we see how this food services and delivery services are growing. They're growing rapidly. So we could not ignore this industry that is soaring. Entertainment, people are more and more dependent on their mobile devices. It is hard to get their attention outside of their smartphones. So we need to make sure that people who spend all this time on entertainment can use our services, too.</p><p>Mobility, that's a very promising industry. We are actively participating in this area. We have great services for public transport. For public transport, you can pay for your commute on -- with a card. So Sberbank is one of the major players on the mobility market. But if you look at other mobility services like travel, with Spasibo loyalty points program you can enter the Spasibo portal, and you can buy air tickets or train tickets. And this is much more beneficial than to be a member of some loyalty programs for -- provided by some hotels and carriers.</p><p>Now I'm not going to talk about the Russian companies. I had miles of some American company -- air company, and they said, \"You can use these points to go to this specific city on Thursday, but you cannot buy the tickets for tomorrow.\" You can use these Spasibo loyalty points to pay for any hotel and any ticket. You know that we're actively working to close our deal with Mail.ru Group. I say that we have an ambition to close it by the end of the year. We're in final stages now. And after the deal is sealed, we will have absolutely new services, Citymobil taxi and YouDrive car sharing service, that is going to be actually development, and that is delivering this mobility service. That is very important. Now the figures that I showed you, just to make sure everyone is on the same page, these figures are the forecast for the end of the year. So our investments in the joint ventures with Mail.ru are there.</p><p>Now safety and security. That's insurance services, health care services, biometric services that helps to protect people from cyber fraud, cybersecurity. And a major problem and challenge many people face is how to find a proper job. According to surveys, 80% of employed people think of moving to another place. That means that every 3 or 4 people present here would consider another place, another employer. So these services should provide this opportunity. And if you talk about our potential clients, corporate clients of our ecosystems, what businesses need?</p><p>Businesses need 3 major elements: how to increase sales, how to cut costs and how to mitigate risks. And we are targeting these 3 major business needs, and we want to offer very good tools to promote their business. As I said before, the majority of the services in our ecosystems are aggregators or marketplaces that try to make sure that you can grow your sales as a company. Cost cutting, well, obviously, Sberbank offers services -- affordable services with good value. And this is -- this would help you to optimize costs. As for risk mitigation, we deliver the services here, too. And all that means that we span across the major needs of the businesses and that we are attractive to our corporate customers.</p><p>Now I would like to talk about our company -- specific companies and move from this general presentation. These are the companies who are participants of our ecosystem. These are the 4 largest companies: Yandex. Market, Rambler, Citymobil and Delivery Club. Today, we are going to have a deep dive presentations about these companies. I will give the floor to the heads of these companies later. I would like to talk about some of the companies that we have not mentioned before to give you some color in terms of how they work and how they are being developed.</p><p>I'll start with SberFood. This is a service delivered with our joint venture with Mail.ru. It is based on these siloed services that we had like Plazius, Afisha. Restaurants. This service was launched on 28th of October 2019. Now we have around 500,000 monthly active users. We have thousands of bookings that is on daily, and more than 2,000 restaurants have been connected. The important thing to understand is that now restaurants move to a new model. The model used to be the following: you would be able to book a table and get some loyalty points or discounts. Now there is a better model. It gives you a kind of an Uber experience but for the restaurants.</p><p>That means that when you finish with your meal, you don't need to wait for a waiter. You just stand up and go, and all the payments will be done automatically, the tips included. This is a very in-demand service. And one of the screen shows that you can split the check at the restaurant between those -- between your friends who are with you at the restaurant. And another important thing is that, together with Mail.ru, we integrated all our services. In SberFood, you have an option. Like you have selected restaurant, but then you have thought, \"I don't want to go there.\" But you can push Delivery Club button, and the restaurant will come to your place, and you will enjoy the restaurant food from the comfort of your sofa.</p><p>Another important project of our joint venture with Mail.ru is SberMarket. It was launched on the 11th of November, just 1 month ago. It was launched based on Instamart service. November saw a radical acceleration of growth, 4.5x growth compared to the same period of the previous year. Works in 16 cities in the Moscow region, and it works in 15 largest cities of Russia. It is developing quite rapidly because this business has a great potential, and I believe that in 2020 the growth rate is going to be at least the same as we see them -- as we see right now.</p><p>David expanded on SberCloud, but we see SberCloud not only as a technical opportunity, but a business opportunity. We see a great potential in this product. We launched this product in test mode in summer this year. But in 2020, it will host 130 -- up to 150 products. And we think the B2G customers, meaning the state authority customers and the business customers will actively use this service. And we will suggest and offer bundles where SberCloud services would be bundled with our banking and nonbanking products.</p><p>Cybersecurity. We are totally obsessed with cybersecurity and security of data. We repel, touchwood, all attacks -- cyberattacks that were launched against Sberbank. But cybersecurity is not only an opportunity to protect yourself, but an opportunity to protect others. So several years ago, I think 3 years ago, we founded a company called BI. ZONE. It's -- it was started from scratch, from greenfield. We didn't acquire any other companies. This is a cybersecurity company. Now it is experiencing a radical growth, not only on the Russian market, but on international market, too. This year, around half of the revenue is accounted for by our international customers. I think that, next year, the growth rate for this business is going to accelerate, and the share of services that we deliver in Russia is going to decrease because these services are in demand across the world. And Russia is quite a small market.</p><p>Now 2 services in biometry, one is VisionLabs and the other one is CRT. I'll start with CRT. This business is our joint venture with Gazprombank. This business is actively growing. It is a leading company in terms of voice recognition, Center for Voice (sic) [of Speech] Technologies. This is how CRT -- this is what the CRT abbreviation stands for. And there are new services that we deliver for the doctors. A doctor in stand of spending huge amounts of time to read the scans or to read the information or to type the information, that is the yesterday. The machine would get the voice-to-text technology, and it will save a lot of time for our doctors, so that they spend more time with the customers or with the patients.</p><p>And VisionLabs is top 1 company in -- according to National Institute of Standards and Technology. That's an American association. So this is a company that is not only the best in Russia but the best in the world in terms of the face recognition algorithm. They got it for accuracy and speed. It is growing. The revenue is growing with more than 100% year-on-year. And you know that Sberbank went to devices market. And you know that smart devices like Evotor conquered the market. It is the most popular smart terminal across the country, and it has a great gap -- the competition is -- has a great gap lagging behind.</p><p>Now another product that I would like to show you, out-of-the-box product. Can I get the box? Can I get the box, too? So this is a device that has been produced. It is a vandal protection -- protected lab. It is a device from our -- developed from our VisionLabs and BI. ZONE, so you cannot hack it. It can work in offline and online mode. It can store up to 500,000 photos. It is an industrial product. It is for the companies. You cannot buy it freely. But for companies who want -- who need to manage access to their properties and facilities, this product will be interesting. You can look at this product in -- during the coffee break. I think that we did a great job in terms of the design, starting from the box to unbox and experience, and everything is in line with the best practices of the Silicon Valley.</p><p>Going on, SberMobile, our mobile operator. There are many discussions around it. But if you remove the emotions and focus on the figures, you see the following. We're actively growing our customer and subscriber base. At the start of the year, we started the regional expansion. And as you can see from 165,000, we moved to 850,000 subscribers. That was done in only 1 year, and our growth is done not only through marketing campaigns. And it is not done through the burning of the money spent for the ads. And if you calculate the price of 1% of the market share across the market, it's 7.5x lower for us than for the average telecom company in Russia gaining this 1% market share. So we are going to develop SberMobile, and we hope that it will be relevant for our customers.</p><p>Sber Solutions is a company that we have acquired last year. This is one of the few examples when we bought the entire company, 100%. It is a company that works for the outsourcing of business processes. This is a B2B subscription that investors love. This is when customers are stuck with the service. So this service is used as a window, as a portal. The company enters this portal. And the more user -- the better user experience the company has, the less they want to go out to abandon the service. So you can see the market share is growing. And we cater for companies working in 30 different industries. Next year, Sber Solutions are going to offer products -- various products for small businesses and for municipal and federal agencies.</p><p>I move into the end of my presentation. In 2017, when we presented our strategy, we stated that we -- our target is to make sure that in 2020, our revenue from nonbanking services would be not less than RUB 70 billion. I would like to underline that this is the revenue from nonbanking revenue. This is our revenue, revenue attributable to Sberbank only, without our partners. I think if we accounted for our partners, it'll be more than RUB 150 billion. But we said that our share would be RUB 70 billion. We're quite confident in -- on delivering on this commitment. And this does not include fee and commissions that Sberbank gets from promoting all services. This part of the income is accounted in the P&amp;L of Sberbank.</p><p>Before going to the companies' presentations, I would like to say that we understand that some companies in the ecosystem have great potential, including great potential for IPO. We understand that there are some limitations for Sberbank in terms of putting companies to the market with -- where the share of Sberbank is more than 50% due to the geopolitical and sanction situation. So the companies who are IPO candidates, we have large stakes there, but not the controlling stake. And all these companies, all these partners, have a great potential to move to IPO in 3, 5 years.</p><p>And now I would like to move back to what I promised. And I would like to give the floor to Maksim Grishakov. He's going -- he's the CEO of Yandex. Market. This is our joint venture with Yandex. After that, you'll have a deep dive delivered by CEO of Rambler, the Head of Citymobil and Delivery Club. And after that, we're going to have a Q&amp;A session. We'll try to answer your question. So Maksim, the floor is yours.</p><p>MAKSIM GRISHAKOV, CEO OF YANDEX.MARKET, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Yes, Lev. Thank you very much. Dear, ladies and gentlemen, again, good morning. Actually, it's my great privilege to address you on the performance of Yandex. Market as an inherent part of the Sberbank ecosystem. I'm going to try to be very brief because the organizers asked me to speed up, we are a bit behind schedule.</p><p>Let me speak a little bit about the market of e-commerce in Russia. The consensus is -- the consensus evaluation is that, in 2019, the market is going to have about 390 orders -- 390 million orders. And the average ticket, about RUB 4,000. Sometimes the tickets are very small in FMCG, for instance, or there are huge tickets in electronics, household appliances. But the average AOU -- AOV is about RUB 4,000. The growth of e-commerce has been continuing and has actually been accelerating. It's a pretty promising area. Generally, we see retail sales growing by several digits of percent, while e-commerce has been growing by 15% to 20%. And the promise is very, very strong for accelerated growth.</p><p>Very briefly, what Yandex. Market is. We have a 2 shareholder structure, equitable shareholders: Yandex and Sberbank. And there are several platforms, Yandex. Market as the local e-commerce market; Beru, the new platform; and there's a few experiments that are the new streams for us for the future development. The history of our development is pretty simple. And on 27th of April last year, we signed the new deal, where we got the new shareholder in the person of Sberbank. In May, we launched a beta of Beru. That was an experiment that pretty quickly went to a full-fledged operation. In October 2018, we officially launched Marketplace. I remember about a year ago I addressed the same audience of analysts of Sberbank, but that was more of a promise.</p><p>When I spoke about Beru, we spoke about the plans and the objectives. Today, I'm here to speak about the performance. And they -- and that performance is actually well above our expectations, and we have been continuing to grow. In 2019, in December, we launched our first own fulfillment center in Rostov. Then we relaunched the aggregator of last mile delivery services, Yandex. Lavka. In May 2019, we launched experiment with our automated disbursement points, the so-called post box machines. Again, later, we, in June, launched Supercheck. That's what Yandex. Market did online, but that's done for offline.</p><p>In July, we finished the integration with Sberbank ID. Right now, Sberbank clients can seamlessly log in with Beru and Yandex. Market. And in November this year, at the peak of e-commerce season, we launched our own warehouse in Sofia. That's about 38,000 square meters of storage. Again, Yandex. Market is a product that's a price comparison product platform, as we call it. There's about 30,000 online stores, about 35 million SKUs and 65 million product offerings as a whole. And the daily audience is about 3.5 million customers. Customers, the monthly audience is about 40 million. And on the peak, it's about 5 million users a day. In Beru, Beru actually did a revolutionary -- accomplished revolutionary growth from scratch. This year, we'll probably be in the top 10 of major online retailers. We've got about 1 million SKUs on the platform, our own products and the Marketplace products. Right now, we are delivering about 40,000, maybe 50,000 orders a day, about 150 goods -- 150,000 goods, products are delivered. And we accrue about 15% to 20% month-on-month.</p><p>Very interesting experiments are also done inside the ecosystem. The Yandex. Market Analytics, that is essentially the competition for companies like GfK and [SUNITSA]. That's only in online sales. We've got a lot of data. So we are doing certain analytical category views and offer those to vendors, to main brands. That is a highly relevant data, very popular. Yandex Dostavka, Yandex Delivery was relaunched on new technologies for online stores. That's an opportunity to integrate ones with Yandex Dostavka, and Yandex Dostavka is integrated with more than 20 last-mile services. Time savings and customer experience is much more streamlined.</p><p>Supercheck -- Superbill, that is a so-called scan-and-go technology. A customer can walk into a store -- brick-and-mortar store, scan a bar code on a product, just to exit and leave. The funds are going to be debited from the account. The pilot -- the first live pilot was launched 2 weeks ago in (inaudible). A couple of stores are operating like that. And then we have an agreement with a number of partners in chain, retail companies where that experiment is going to continue. As for the growth rate of revenue, we are accelerating. Last year, we grew just under 50%. This year, we're going to grow just under 3x. Versus the market, you saw that about 18% is a growth market by. That's colossal growth. That speaks to the actual popularity of the service. We are using our own technologies, the technologies of our shareholders, and we are doing everything we can to capture the leadership in this market.</p><p>Again, a few words about the Yandex. Market. This is a platform where people choose goods, compare prices and choose the online stores. This year, 26 million orders will be placed -- will have been placed using Yandex. Market. About 20 million is GMV. That's the turnover that helped Yandex -- that Yandex helped for the local e-commerce. Just as a reference note, if you talk about the internal domestic e-commerce, and we don't aggregate foreign players, this is about 25% of the market. That's the GMV created by Yandex. Market. And this is daily average usage, about 3.5 million on average for the year. We had upwards of 5 million a day.</p><p>That's just -- only several platforms and websites in Russia that have the same daily audience of 5 million people. The growth of Yandex. Market was about 30%. Again, Yandex. Market is not growing in hundreds of percent, that's a mature business. But this is still just under 200% above the average growth rate of the market in here. This is how the GMV is growing, just about 200 million is the GMV. And the orders are growing at an exceeding rate, by 30%.</p><p>What are we expecting going forward? What do we intend to do with the platform? Historically, the platform largely was about price comparison. And when people understood what product they wanted, they compared the lowest price or the most interesting store to buy it in. Right now, we are increasingly diversifying. We are setting ourselves apart from the competition. We are developing the choice of product. We want to buy exactly the product that people want, because very often, they buy the wrong product at the low price. The number of products is huge. So the huge UC content -- user-generated content, we are trying to help. People bought a lot of goods and help other people to buy the right -- to choose the right product and then find the right store to buy at end. This is one of the biggest topics that we are developing inside the Yandex. Market.</p><p>A couple of words to say on Beru, about 1 million SKUs in the platform, starting from scratch, pretty much. We are covering the length of breadth of categories, except for apparel. And some goods that are not allowed to sell online are alcohol, health. And we are not selling auto parts, and we are not doing temperature logistics goods -- temperature-specialized or goods requiring the specialist logistics. This is a trend for developing of orders -- delivered orders. There are certain seasonality elements. But versus the market, this is not really seasonal. We are mostly talking about the growth of the audience, the growth of average ticket, et cetera. To be effective and efficient, we need to control the fulfillment because our main mission is to ensure the maximum quality we want to deliver because that's the reason why we are investing in logistical capabilities.</p><p>We've got 3 fulfillment centers in Moscow region, 1 in Rostov. And we've got ambitious plans to keep covering the 1 million strong cities in Russia, where the -- all the orders are concentrated over the next couple of years. Next year, the highly ambitious plan is we are trying to bring the variety to a level of at least twice larger than now, at about 2 million SKUs, we are aiming to have. We are going to be offering the rational prices, optimal prices. We're analyzing the market. We're going to be suggesting the best price. We are obviously working on cutting deliveries short for all the buyers in Russia. Right now, we are covering about 25% of the population of Russia with the orders delivered next day. And next year, we intend to increase that percent dramatically. We are also developing the loyalty program. We are working with the loyalty programs -- our loyalty programs with our shareholders, Sberbank. We're highly -- we are operating very intensively with Spasibo. About 15% of goods on Beru are bought with Spasibo. We are very satisfied with this integration. We are highly -- we're very glad that this partnership was concluded.</p><p>As for the challenges, in 2020, it's obviously going to be infrastructure. In e-commerce, infrastructure is always short. So we are balancing between how quickly we can develop the speed of investment and the scalability of the things we already know how to do and have learned how to do. This is obviously the development of scope and scale. In 2018, people usually complained that these goods are short, those goods are short. Right now, the number of such complaints is going -- has gone down dramatically. Next year, I think we're going to cover all the main interest of our customers. And obviously, the same-day delivery or the next-day delivery is becoming the normal. And we are now catching up with competition, and we will actively fight for the leadership in this area.</p><p>As for the ecosystem -- I am running out of time, and I must speed up. We talked about the super receipt. We actually launched a true experiment with the scan-and-go technology. Great potential in the app because despite online growing at huge rates, that's only 5% to 6% of the entire sales. The remaining 94%, 95% is the rest. So the Supercheck is a product that is helping the people who are shopping offline. And if you actually walked into an offline store, we are going to help avoid the queue on the cash register and buy the good -- the product in the most convenient fashion. We're also working with a second shareholder with Yandex. We are trying to use the developments that they have been able to come up with, Alisa. That's one such development. It is integrated in Beru and Yandex. Market and users can use Alisa to order goods. That scenario is in its nascent stage. We are advancing it nonetheless.</p><p>Yandex announced recently this pilot project in robo delivery. When that test is no longer a test and goes into fully viable operation, Beru is going to benefit from that kind of delivery. As for Spasibo, we are very happy that we are having that partner. That's 15% of our GMV. 15% of our GMV is done by Spasibo. And we are working to integrate as much as we can with Sberbank partner applications, Sberbank Online. Like I said, right now, we have the full integration set up. If you have a Sberbank ID, you can seamlessly integrate into Beru without the additional passwords, without the additional accounts. This simplifies the so-called user journey and allows you to benefit from all the good things in the ecosystem. So much I have to say. I apologize for having to speed up.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Thank you, Maksim. We're going to have the general Q&amp;A for you, Lev Aronovich and all the other speakers of the ecosystem. And right now, we are passing the baton to Rafael Abramyan. That's the CEO of Rambler.</p><p>RAFAEL ABRAMYAN, CEO OF RAMBLER GROUP, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity to speak very briefly. Let me tell you what the Rambler Group is. A lot of people remember what that is, but not the actual inside of it.</p><p>What is the group? That's a media business of other things. There's a lot of media assets. I'm going to tell you about those separately. I'm also going to tell you that it's a leading group. It's a video property, the Okko live streaming platform. I'm going to dwell in detail on that. And the online to offline, they're rather popular commutation today. That's a service that allows you to organize you've live in offline with the online sophistication available on the web. The overall audience is about 60 million people. That's people, not MAU. MAU it's 125 million. That's Yandex. Radar. Yandex. Radar is actually the most precise measurement tool to gauge the Internet market. So we have 62 million people on a monthly basis. And over 1 million people actually pay Rambler Group services.</p><p>Let me tell you about our media segment. The media segment comprises pretty much the brands that you know: Lenta, Gazeta, Championat. Afisha, the billboard, that's certainly known by all in St. Petersburg and Moscow people, Women Journal, Passion, Letidor, and that's about 15 brands on all, major brands in the portfolio. If you talk about sub-brands, they are much more numerous. And all that big portfolio of brands puts us first as a media holding company. We're the #1 digital media holding in Russia. Again, that is according to Yandex. Radar. That's not the figure we counted up or even our shareholders. That is essentially the customers. This is how we are noted.</p><p>We actually won that position through those 62 million people -- audience. Those are the users of our media services. On DAU, the conversion is about 15%. That's about 9 million people. That is a highly volatile figure month-to-month. On a good month, it might be actually 10 million. And this month, we grew about 20% for media element of the business. That's a pretty good thing. The advertising market is going through less than easy times. And everything that's advertising concerned hasn't growing not that fast. Historically, we have been growing well above the market. Why? Because this setup of brands and the fame of these brands allows us to keep pretty large CPMs. CPM that's cost per mile.</p><p>The most important cost on the Internet, that's CPM, in Lenta, Gazeta, those CPM figures are pretty well above the market average. Plus, we monetize those resources in programmatic, in the tech, tools to monetize in the advertising market. We've got our own stack. It is similar to Yandex and to Mail as big data analytics and the stack of BMP, DSP and other technologies. I'm not going to dwell in detail on those. That's pretty much a triumvirate, a troika of technologies that helps us to monetize those technologies technologically as well as through other ways.</p><p>We're not just selling advertising, where our managers come to a brand and suggest buying something on Lenta.ru. This is a full sales of advertising inside the audience segments. What awaits us in 2020 as for the media element of the group? That is primarily the products. We're going to work on our products. We appreciate that some of them need renewal. There is a pretty strong amount of products that need to be renewed 2 years, every 2 years, patterns of consumption change, and we need to follow those.</p><p>The second thing to note is a lot of video tools have been coming up online. We have started working on that pretty actively. In 2017 and '18, we have been thinking about that actively. But in 2019, we adopted this rule that every new article, every piece of news should be accompanied by a certain video piece. That is not a video created especially for this article. It might be a video simply unrelated, but it must be related to the context, to the personality described in the article, et cetera. And for that end, we use a lot of partner videos. We screen our own videos. That's pretty cheap. We use iPhones. We use all kinds of other devices of our correspondents, the reporters and journalists, just to make sure that, that users use more videos.</p><p>All patterns of consumptions are skewed to video. People don't wish to read increasingly. But watching a video that's 1-minute long and get a general idea of what's happening, everyone is interested in that. The second thing is O2O, online-to-offline business. We are #1 in Russia in selling electronic tickets to cinemas through Rambler. Kassa, Rambler Cash Register. That was in 2016, it was launched, as a spin-off. It became a separate activity. It got united with Afisha, the billboard, and now it's a single project. You are obviously looking for something through Afisha, then you can buy through Yandex. Kassa. But first people actually look in Afisha, look for a performance to watch. And Yandex. Kassa is a back-end player.</p><p>40% of movie tickets are sold through Yandex. Kassa. Very importantly, not all of those 40% are sold through Afisha. Only about 1/4 of those are sold through Afisha. The rest, 3/4, are sold through partners. Rambler. Kassa is an engine in Yandex. Tickets where you can buy tickets. In Google, if you're looking for a certain ticket -- if you're looking for a certain movie and you want to buy a certain movie from -- right from the search live, that's where you can buy. Rambler. Kassa is back end for a lot of transactions on tickets in Russia. Afisha is the front end. People who live in Moscow and in other large towns, you will know what Afisha is. It has been about 20 years that this is the -- it has been the opinion leader in everything entertainment related and related to free past time. And we continue to take this brand forward in terms of strength, but we do intend to expand, federalize, go to the regions more in the region Afisha is not that strongly present as it is present in the metropolitan areas.</p><p>Talking about 2020 and onwards in terms of [Sber Kassa], so we want to go to the market of offline events. Cinema is something that is very promising. There are many users, but there are limitations in terms of the ticket price. The ticket price is quite small. The average ticket is about RUB 300, and there are no user commissions -- user fees and commissions. So Russian users do not pay commissions for the cinema tickets. Around the world, the users do pay this fee. We, in Russian market, no, for some reason, might be changed. But there are concerts and theater performances, and users are okay with the fees there. The margin there is good. And for Rambler. Kassa, for Rambler Cash Register, it is a good promising niche in terms of offline events.</p><p>Talking about Okko. For those of you who don't know, Okko was created as Yota Play. So that was kind of an R&amp;D division of Yota, a mobile operator. It was a spin-off. It was developing as a separate business, an independent service in 2014, 2017, and we became shareholders of Okko in 2018. So it was acquired by Rambler Group. Before that, Okko was showing quite good results. And that was why we acquired it. There were no tools for aggressive development, no huge traffic or audience. It was number -- the second best largest player on the market. So we took this company. We acquired this company in Rambler Group and accelerated its development.</p><p>And in 2018, the revenue went up double-fold. And in 2018, we increased the profit even more. And by the end of 2019, we forecast the revenue to grow 100% year-on-year. The paying -- the number of paying users will increase threefold year-on-year. I'm going to talk about that in detail. Today, Okko has 1 million paid users. By the end of the year, we're going to announce about this figure that we have achieved 1 million paying users. It is a very important figure for the service. We started this year with 300,000 paying users. So that's a hugely forward that we did in this year. It was obviously thanks to being united with either Rambler and Sberbank.</p><p>So what are we plan to do in Okko? We're going to improve the product. Everyone is reading the Netflix reports. So the recommendation system is at the core. How do you make sure that this 43,000 content elements that we have that I showed you in the previous slides, how do you show them properly to users, so that they actually watch them, so that they are actually interested in that? So we work a lot in -- to improve our recommendation engine. We have our in-house team. We have reco, kind of a recommendation engine, a proprietary solution. But when we connect it to Sberbank and the ecosystem of Sberbank, it will give us even more opportunities to get more data, depersonalized data. But this data is very important, and we'll have some algorithm and ML mechanisms that will be made available to us.</p><p>Cloud, another very important thing. David talked extensively about that. I'm not going to repeat the statement. This is #1 strategy, obviously, and we're now actively integrating with Sberbank cloud. I think that in 2020, the bulk of our scalable applications are going to be migrated to SberCloud. Content, for online cinema, content is everything. The same goes for other media players. We are leaders in terms of the exclusive content, and it was successfully debated in the media. We have exclusive rights for the English Premier League. We have been having this rights for 3 years now. We don't share it with anyone else. That's a huge thing. We are the only company in the world who has an exclusive right to broadcast British Premier League without having our own channel. This is an interesting case.</p><p>From the commercial standpoint, we're actually doing great. So it's not some investment. Thanks to sponsorship contracts and thanks to the interest in British Premier League, we have monetized these exclusive rights in the first year, although we do not expect that even in our most optimistic scenarios. And actually, in App Store, if you go to App Store, you would see that Okko and British Premier League is going to be on the first screen, maybe not for everyone because App Store is working on their recommendation system, too.</p><p>In terms of the content, I'd like to talk about some new alternative ways to deliver content to the users. This is Okko cinema. This is something new on the market. We announced it 3 weeks ago. We're going to make this kind of a television theater. So this theater performances that are performed in the Moscow theaters would be broadcasted through Okko. So if you cannot go to the theater, you can look at this -- at the performance from the comfort of your sofa. That's a very exciting story for online streaming.</p><p>Another thing. We're not pioneers globally, but in Russia, we are the first company to deliver TED Talks. TED Talk, if you don't know, that's kind of entertainment and educational speech. (inaudible) TV, that's some interesting thing related to classical music. So we work with majors lot. We try to make sure how to improve the deals with majors. Majors, these are large international businesses. It's kind of hard to negotiate with them. But we're showing them the raw growth rates and our -- the fact that we're quite a promising company in the Russian market. So I think that in the nearest future, we will announce some great details about our new deals with majors that would disrupt the market.</p><p>Investment strategy. Well, obviously, we're going to invest in developing the brand of Okko. Up until recently, Okko did not have an opportunity to actively invest in marketing and in the people. Now we will have this opportunity, thanks to Sberbank and other companies. Now talking about Sberbank just in a bit more detail. We have launched quite a lot of exciting initiatives with Sberbank, within the ecosystem that Sberbank has and coupled with the -- and benefiting from the banking business in the group. As with Delivery Club, Citymobil and Beru, we are launching some cross-sales promo campaigns. In terms of integration and seamless experience, Sber ID for us is a major priority.</p><p>As Maks told, we've made deep links with Sber ID in our app, so you can register in Okko or log in Okko through a Sber ID, so you can actually use it. Now in our distribution bundle that we have, you can connect to offline network of Sberbank. I think there were some questions that were put to Alexander Vedyakhin. There was a question, do you want to drive down offline -- your offline network? No, offline networks will become something new. They will reinvent themselves. And I think Okko would be the project that will drive this reinvention of the offline brick-and-mortar Sberbank branches. Maybe there will be some new things there. And this is something that we're working on at.</p><p>Now I do not know who is that? I don't know what is his name. This is some young person, young man, who put his story in Instagram. And I liked it. I decided to put it in my presentation. So he decided to reissue this Sberbank card in brick-and-mortar branch and he subscribed to Okko. So we're actively working on that. We are using the Sberbank brick-and-mortar branches to sell our services. And I think that 2020, we will -- in 2020, we will jump-start these sales. Thank you very much.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Thank you. The Q&amp;A session is going to follow later. Donmez Guvenc, the Head of Delivery Club.</p><p>G\u00c3\u00bcVEN\u00c3\u00a7 D\u00c3\u00b6NMEZ, HEAD OF DELIVERY CLUB, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Pleasure to be here. I'll speak in English. I'll cover the Delivery Club business. So first of all, I'd like to mention the overall food market in Russia. We all know that the food delivery market in Russia is still at the early stages. It's actually underdeveloped. And together with us, it's growing very fast. If you compare it versus the global benchmarks, you can see that the penetration of the food delivery still is at 32%, which has a huge further room to grow. And if you look at the overall size of the market per capita, you can still see that the Russians are not necessarily ordering enough food. And there's a big, big room to grow here. And this is where we are playing a role.</p><p>If you take the food market, which we call the out-of-home dining, which is also including both the food -- eating food outside, but also food delivery that is coming from outside, this is from 2008 numbers that overall delivery is only, what, 9% of the market. And this is where we are playing, and 91% is the regular dining or takeaway. But if you look at the future, we see that -- we expect that, that is going to grow to 14% of the market. And within that market, we believe that the aggregators are going to play a huge role because of the stickiness of the overall platforms and the new user acquisitions and simply a better experience for the customer. And we expect that today that roughly 20% of the market in terms of the food delivery in the aggregators, and we expect that it's going to be more than 50% of the market by 2022.</p><p>If you look at what happened with Delivery Club recently is, yes, overall, we are the leader in terms of the overall monthly users.</p><p>But recently, we've been accelerating that significantly, especially with the -- since we signed the term sheet with Sberbank and we have changed our marketing strategy and we have accelerated our growth. And you can see that we've been the leader in the market. And now we're extending our lead versus our competition in terms of the users.</p><p>And if you look at the numbers of the downloads, we've been challenged by competition last year, but again, here, we are taking the clear lead as we have accelerated our growth, especially in the last quarter. And I want to talk about that growth and what's really driving that growth.</p><p>The market is divided into 2 types of deliveries, right. One of them is the 1P delivery, and the other is 3P. 3P delivery is basically what we send the order to the restaurants and restaurants are doing their own deliveries. That's 3P order marketplace. 1P is where we are collecting the order for the restaurant, but we are also sending a courier to the restaurant to pick up this order and deliver. And what we're seeing is overall globally, the 1P big rollout because generally speaking, 1P is causing -- actually generating better customer retention, better experience because the whole experience is better controlled with the tech and of the user -- the food aggregators' user platforms. This is exactly what we have been rolling out recently. And as you can see versus year ago, in the past 12 months, we have basically increased our 1P deliveries 7x, and that's one of the biggest reasons of our growth.</p><p>Now while you are talking about that, you might ask the question, what's happening with 3P and what's happening to Delivery Club. Given that we have been a 3 -- originally a 3P player, we have also seen that as we are expanding to 1P, our 3P business also accelerated. Why is that happening? Because it's basically creating better traffic and better user stickiness for us because, basically, customers are being able to access not only to the restaurants who have the own delivery services, but also with us, they are accessing to the restaurants who don't have their delivery services, thanks to us. So what's happening is more and more customers seeing more and more restaurants, and that actually explains our growth, which is 1P growth is also driving the 3P growth. And Delivery Club here is uniquely positioned as a hybrid player in the market.</p><p>And this is what I'm talking about in terms of the strong network effect. So basically, what we do is we basically attract more new customers. And then with our marketing and with our initiatives, we drive more orders. As a result, we are the bigger platform. And as a result of this, more restaurants -- more and more restaurants wants to sign up with Delivery Club. We have been accelerating our sign up with restaurants. We have -- now we are working with more than 12,000 restaurants, and we believe that there's a huge room to grow. I mean, if you look at the total addressable market, there's more than 80,000 restaurants in the long term that we can play with. And [it is that] you have more restaurants, and when you have more restaurants, which means that on the app, you have more options, that leads to more new user acquisition. And this is the positive feeding cycle and the network effect that is really driving the Delivery Club growth.</p><p>In addition to this, what we want to do is we want to go beyond access to all the cities and we want to provide this food delivery service to the customers of Russia. It's not only a Moscow and St. Petersburg phenomenon, we have been already operating with more than 120 cities with a 3P service. But since we rolled out the 1P service, now we are in more than 30 cities. And actually, this is Q3 numbers, as of today, we are in 33 cities. And now we are accessing the 30% of the total Russian population. And this has been a very healthy growth because what we're doing is we're bringing a new type of eating habits to the rest of Russia, and we've been on the leading edge of it.</p><p>Now the question is, yes, we are investing and is this growth really sustainable. So I want to give you some insights about our growth. This is our cohorts. Cohorts are -- they're basically the customers that we acquired in our platform in last year, so a complicated chart. But simply, what it shows is the users that we have acquired last year, actually made more orders this year. And if you look at the history, we are activating more and more users that we acquired in the previous users. That's very important for the platform because that shows the stickiness of the platform, which is we are getting users and they are making more orders. And as you can see, we have the record acquisition, although the year is not finished. This is with the Q3 numbers. And that shows why our growth is sustainable. And at the same time, if you look at the graph on the right, you can see that the overall retention rate is also increasing on a 12-month basis, which means that we're getting more new users and we're retaining them more, and that is the underlying engine of our growth.</p><p>And of course, this is reflecting on the financials as well. So if you look at versus a year ago, we have almost tripled our revenues on a total quarter basis and most of this 1P expansion has been playing a huge role in that.</p><p>I also want to give a little bit of insight about the question, hey, are you investing more and you're buying this growth like so what's happening on the cost side, right. So actually, I'm very glad to say that in terms of the investment versus the top line proportion, actually, our investment proportionally is going down versus our top line growth, which means that we're actually growing more efficiently. Why? It's basically because of several reasons, other than changing the marketing strategy and being more efficient on marketing, we also see that in terms of our logistics cost, we have seen a significant cost decrease, and this is just to start with -- especially with the rollout of the AI. And now we are using machine learning and AI algorithms in terms of both auto assignments, but also in terms of the scheduling of our couriers, and we have seen a significant increase in terms of auto assignment. And of course, our target is to make it back 100% in the very near future.</p><p>So basically we're -- as we are getting more scale and we are rolling out our 1P, at the same time, we are investing in the technology, machine learning, and also this is making us more and more efficient. And I would say that there's still more room to go because, as you have seen, we have been really significantly rolling out the 1P in the last year.</p><p>I also want to talk a little bit about the future and our strategy. So we are not only a food delivery aggregator, we don't want only just deliver the food. But we think about ourselves is more of a solution for food needs. And together, especially with the Mail. Ru ecosystem and also the Sber ecosystem behind us and around us, this gives us a huge opportunity in terms of becoming a bigger food player. I mean these are all the different verticals that we can talk about and we can experiment that we have already started to work in.</p><p>For example, we have announced our joint venture with the Novikov Group, and we have already set our kitchens and we started to operate with them. We are doing numerous other initiatives and experiments that we will talk about later in the future.</p><p>Where we are going to expand our offering, and as Mr. Lev Khasis presented with the Sber food coming in, there's huge synergies and there's huge opportunity for us to work as part of a big ecosystem and take advantage of that and become the food solution for, especially, the -- all the Russian customers.</p><p>So with that, that's all the time that I have. I would like to hand over to my colleague from Citymobil.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: Thank you so much. Vitaly Bedarev, Citymobil.</p><p>VITALY BEDAREV, CEO OF CITYMOBIL, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Dear colleagues, my name is Vitaly Bedarev. I'm Head of Citymobil -- CEO of Citymobil. Now [brand] show and mobility. Now talking about mobility now. Now first of all, I would like to talk about the market that we operate in, and it is obvious that we're operating on the taxi market in Russia. By 2023, it is going to be -- full GMV is going to be -- this market is going to be higher than RUB 1 trillion. Now it's -- the market is growing quicker and quicker, and the number of online platforms and aggregators, the share of aggregators is growing. We're expecting that the growth is going to accelerate, the growth of aggregators is going to accelerate, including in the regions, and we're focused on the regions, too.</p><p>In midterm, we think that there will be consolidation of the market, maybe there will be like 2, 3, maybe 4 players. The share -- the market shares of the leaders are going to increase. We will see that the leaders will get better bottom line and the weak players will go out from the market.</p><p>Now in the nearest term, we will see somewhat a model experiment. We are not experimenting and working on taxi market, but the mobility market, you need to go from Point A to Point B in the quickest way, in the cheapest way or both, not -- you don't need a taxi as per se.</p><p>So our competition and ourselves are going to help people just move and maybe not just people. The first experiments are already done. We have a project with Aeroexpress. You can come from an airport to the rail station and then on taxi on a single ticket. We're the first here in Russia. But these are small things. And given the integration with Sberbank ecosystem and all these integrations in public transport, multimodal mobility is going to be a big topic. That's the market for 2030.</p><p>We're going to see integrated city mobility systems, it's not going to be 3 or 4 shoulders of mobility, it's going to be a fully integrated system. Sometimes you can see that in China, DiDi. Sometimes you are going to come to that in Russia, autonomous vehicles, obviously, keenly awaited, but that's a more distant future. That's the market we compete in.</p><p>Why is Citymobil a small player, relatively, why are we still in business? We're not that small, but even 2 years ago, we were not really known. Why do you think we can claim a big share of this market? Here are all the reasons, to compete in the Russian market and to compete in the market of taxi and transportation in general, you need to have 3 things: 2-sided marketplace, passengers, demand and supply, cab drivers, taxi parks and cars. And we need a platform, the platform meets the demand and supply, the right functioning, good experience, et cetera.</p><p>When I talk about the product, that's the part of history that is probably the key element in our history. When I talk about the product, that's not just a good, comfortable rider's app, it must be comfortable, it must be nice, it must be attractive for you to come back to it. But the most important thing is to use the technology. It might not be super obvious, but the business of aggregator is very high-tech. It is about the algorithms. It is about the machine learning, it's about the smart dispatch. The optimal number of orders for the optimal number of drivers, you don't have to give the driver that was just passing by the order that was nearby. And as the price -- pricing is the same thing. Sometimes it's actually more complicated or routing, for instance, for all those cab drivers, and that's just a part of the tech stack. There are some devices that need to be in the car to ensure their security, their reliability and the quality of the service and saturate us with the data of the cities and towns and the roads. This is a technology story.</p><p>Our technology is sufficient enough to show us the growth that I'm going to show you in the next slides. But with the 2 ecosystems, technological ecosystems behind us, we're going to add to that.</p><p>Everyone knows about what Sberbank is. In Sberbank, there are, what, 11,000 engineers. That's more in global Uber. We are pretty confident that in the -- for the tech partnerships that we have, we can succeed as we intend to.</p><p>Now here is about supply and demand. Now to make that service work, you need to get the user somewhere. In terms of access to users, we don't seem to be equal. We don't seem to have an equal in the nation. There are 2 ecosystems: Mail. Ru and Sberbank, again, the 2 partners. Mail. Ru are the 2 largest networks in the country, VK and (inaudible). Let me show you how we acquire the new users.</p><p>Sberbank is popular in terms of Dell, in finance. In finance, this is, by far, the Colusa but Sberbank online is actually used more than Yandex taxi every day. And Sberbank online is just a part of distribution, there is a branch network that are getting transformed. So in terms of access to users, the data of the users, the acquisition of those, we can't -- we are not -- no one comes close.</p><p>So here's about the supply. People who opened the app rarely think about the taxi drivers or the taxi parks, what's under the hood, that's the story. Citymobil, historically, we used to cater to the drivers, we're a driver-friendly company. We still -- we saw humans in them and we still do. Sometimes it's about the positioning of Lyft. We are not ashamed of being a similar company to Lyft, except we thought about this before Lyft. This is manifested in a lot of things we do: around-the-clock support in the taxi driver centers that we take care of the drivers, a lot of other interesting things. We win the drivers to us and we're going to lock them into our system if we build a good relationship and if we ensure the right cost for them. The cost of driving for 1 hour, leasing and fuel. I mean, these are the 2 most important costs. I'm not going to give you the details, they are sensitive. But with the data that we have, with the scoring models of Sberbank Leasing with what we can do with those models and Sberbank Leasing themselves, the proposition that we can make can be unbeatable. That is our strong suit.</p><p>Why don't we talk about the reality here? What we did was we grew regionally. Regional rollout was our main mission, and we actively pursued it. This is the exponential growth of rollout in the cities, starting from the second quarter of 2019. In the second quarter, we experimented. Towards the end of the year, we really accelerated. Not a single company didn't really roll out with that speed from such a low base. Right now, we are pretty much the quickest growing company in Russia in cab driving business.</p><p>We are going into the largest cities where we believe that ridesharing can be profitable. We know certain things that tell us that, that's going to be the case. And that is really making it tough on competition and that really drives our own profitability. So moving in strong cities first and then the cities beyond them, but they are still more profitable, but more -- but as -- less than profitable, but more interesting.</p><p>Because I have never heard about you. Well, in 2018, no one heard about us in Moscow. Yet, we are brand #3 in Moscow, we became it in under a year. And if you look at the first 2 brands, that's the same company, the same supplier, the same platform. So as a company, we are #2, and we actually overtook the fourth company here. Doing that in the regions will not be that complicated because the federal company using Sberbank resources, that's going to be even more efficient than local companies.</p><p>We did a lot with the product. I'm not going to enumerate everything. That's a pretty random assortment of features because the product is a continuous improvement. I mean every week, something has to be improved.</p><p>I'm going to tell you that the riders app came first in iOS charts in Travel section, and it stayed there for several weeks. That is probably the result of us doing a lot of interesting thing. Very importantly, we did that on the strain platform. The efficiency of dispatch pricing and routing is accounted for by better drives, better utilization of driver time and that's the root of those improvements. I'm going to talk about those a bit later. The development of the platform, you don't see it, but this is the key to how we can develop the product.</p><p>Obviously, the ecosystem is the key. As Sber ID is already there. We're already integrated. We already are going to be enriched by the data and enrich the Sberbank Online. SoC, that's already used. Okko, we are doing certain things with them. We are already starting the supply side project with Sber Leasing, that's a very promising activity. That's what I talked about on the business model slide. Pilot projects so far, soon it's going to be about rolling it out into industrial operation. That's what 2020 is going to be about.</p><p>Here's an example of what -- how we use the audience. We have the largest access to the audience, VKontakte, that's the largest network in the country. We launched VK Taxi in the platform. We did the optimal user interface. It is as good in quality as a main app. All our conversions are pretty much the same. And we see a huge growth of travel there. That growth is going to continue.</p><p>Yandex System, Yandex has Uber. We have Citymobil and VK Taxi, perhaps we can get something else. That's how we're going to use our new channels. That's a huge source of traffic, we're very satisfied with it.</p><p>The growth, 10 million rides in November, 30% growth month-on-month, 3x higher than the same period last year. I don't know about the nation, I don't think anyone grows quicker than we do. We are right now larger than the Russian Uber was at the time of the deal with Yandex. I'm 100% sure of that, despite the data not being shown for that deal. And our unit economics is probably better than Uber's economics for there. I was in Uber back then, so take me at my word here.</p><p>Now let me talk about the unit economics. All aggregators are expected by burning up cash. They buy the market share for crazy money, millions are spent. That not so. Yes, we do invest and we will invest. We will continue to invest in 2020 to grow the market share in key markets, do not doubt that, and we will affect the pricing, how the subsidies are going to look. All of that is going to happen. But we are rationally investing with the right unit economics. And I'm talking about the gross profit from every ride, that's our revenue minus subsidy for drivers and minus discounts to passengers.</p><p>Three groups of cities, all groups pre '19, the [tech] that launches pre '19, pre October of '19. Third group post-October '19 in all the economics, we are good. The more rides, the more money we get. All our technology is going to be used in all of those cities. If we invest, we must capture huge market shares in everybody because our market is about the density. A lot of orders, a lot of drivers are necessary for this market to operate well for quick service times, for good quality.</p><p>We are investing, but as G\u00c3\u00bcven\u00c3\u00a7 said, proportionally, every month, we are spending less and growing more. Our EBITDA to growth is improving.</p><p>And the last thing to say about our plans for the future. We're going to grow 5x in the first half of next year. We intend to grow, but I'm pretty sure that we aren't going to succeed in that. There are 4 main areas that we're going to be doing in 2020: regional expansion, we're going to grow where we are; we have entered new cities, all the millions from cities and only cities beyond that where we can be profitable.</p><p>We need to develop the product, the core product. We are catching up with the leaders in the market, and we're going to start integrating with the ecosystem. VK Taxi is one example, same goes for Sberbank. A strong federal brand will be built pretty much understood how we can do that. That's more of a technical issue. And we're going to start building up the potential of all those audiences. The pilot projects are showing good data. We're going to roll those out. And in supply, we're going to continue the push on driver deliveries and look for interesting news on how we work with leasing.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much, so much we have to say on the ecosystem. That's the presentations. If I may, I would like to invite all the speakers who address you on stage, and we are opening the Q&amp;A stage.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Please ask your question. Please address it to someone, and we're going to help you with that. Kate, Jana, please help with the microphones. Andrzej, (inaudible), Olga, you all have questions? Okay. Yes, let's move ahead. Okay. Those are the chairs? Right. Do you intend to sit? Do you intend to stand. Right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That RUB 70 billion of business, that is clearly not enough to make profits. So what sort of revenue base do you need to break even? And under what circumstances would you be forced to impair the value of your investments?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] Sure yes, again, RUB 70 billion is the figure, not of the revenue of the ecosystem, that's the revenue of the ecosystem as a share of Sberbank's revenue. In light of our shares, the actual revenue of the ecosystem is going to be about RUB 150 billion. It can be less, it may be more.</p><p>Certainly, many of our businesses are going through the stage of quick growth. You have seen it today, and we think that this can be below the waterline in terms of bottom line over the 3- to 5-year horizon. Yet, some of those are breaking even. As Sber Solutions, as Bedarev shared, they're going to be profitable already next year. A lot of our companies like SberCloud may be profitable starting from the first year of operation.</p><p>And giving you a firm guidance that to a certain year, by a certain year, all of them are going to be profitable. I just can't give you that guidance. But we are planning at over the 3- to 5-year horizon, most -- the absolute majority of the companies that we develop are going to be breaking even and cash flow positive. If I answered your question.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Next question, Gabor?</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY: Any idea about what's the breakdown of the ecosystem ventures within this RUB 70 billion? So which ones are the most impactful? And when we think about the growth over a 3- to 5-year time frame, where could this -- where could these revenues grow? And where would you expect the growth to come from.</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] Yes, when I answered the previous question, I can just say that Rambler, its media element of the business is profitable already. And the video streaming business, after it accumulates a sufficient customer base, it was still profitable. The unit economics are still positive. And we are looking very carefully at the unit economics of all our businesses. We think that in 2020, we're going to start giving more detailed breakdown, more detailed reporting for our key companies that are the largest contributors to this revenue.</p><p>Obviously, the 4 companies present on this stage. Because we have a joint venture with Yandex, and we have the joint venture with Mail. Ru, both of these companies, Yandex and Mail are public companies. So we're going to have to agree the manner in which we provide that information. They probably won't object. So perhaps on these 4 companies and perhaps on some other companies, major companies, we're going to give you detailed reports on a regular basis, some kind of detailed information just for you to analyze, to work with your models. We have that in our plans for 2020.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Next question?</p><p>ANDREY PAVLOV-RUSINOV: [Interpreted] Andrey Rusinov, Goldman Sachs. Lev Aronovich, you mentioned in your presentation that RUB 70 billion is the revenue of the ecosystem companies, but you also plan to get some income from this cooperation as part of your basic fees and commissions income. Could you tell us about how you cooperate, what is the setup in this cooperation? Because all these companies are going to be actively using your ecosystem, your branches, your brand, and that is pretty strong, a contribution for you to monetize it somehow.</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] Yes. If a company uses our brand, they pay us a license fee for the use of the brand. If they use our channels, they pay for the channels. You will appreciate that a lot of our employees and the branches that sell our products. They are a cost for us. If the company has used them, they pay for the cost of sale. And for our business block that's called sales network, that is obviously a profitable activity that the profit -- where the profit comes from the fees or the download once the special offer is activated. And all of that is done pretty much on the market terms. So we know very well what the cost of customer acquisition is for all the businesses. And with every business we make the agreement on the tariffs that we get from this business for the acquisition of the customer. We don't want that channel to be the most expensive channel for them. But we certainly don't do this for free because we have our costs and they wish to earn a bit on that. In every particular case, we make an agreement that's mutually beneficial for the ecosystem company and the bank.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Olga?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] The same question. At the end of the day, do you have any assessment about the commissions that the bank gets from the services on top of the RUB 70 billion in revenue from the ecosystem? And then continuation of this question, would that be fair to speak about the expense that Sberbank allocates to the services? Or is this the wrong metric because all the spending that Sberbank does is going through equity investments. I mean we're going to think about P&amp;L of the nonbanking element one way or another, so.</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] Yes, that's a good question. So it would be good to clarify. We don't subsidize any of the ecosystem companies. The only contribution we do is the equity investment. In all of the companies that sit in front of you, we already accomplished that investment. For some, that might be sufficient for the breakeven, for some, something else that must be required. But besides that, we don't have any additional subsidy way. And for the first part of the question, that was about the fees and commissions. Well, fees and commissions are shown in the P&amp;L reporting of the bank. And we obviously want the increasing share of income to be gained from the noninterest-bearing risks. So you're going to see that in the report of the bank as fees and commissions income.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Next question, [Aleksey]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] First question, in terms of the vision, Sberbank has around 60 million unique retail customers. Well, 95 million, it was the figure there, but the unique customers. Well, that's about digital retail customers, okay, 95 million, whatever. But the bulk division, what can you get from the point of view of the volume of services, number of services for one Sberbank customers have like 10 million, 5 million users that would not only use card-to-card transfer, but would order taxi, watch cinemas, use markets, Yandex markets and do some other entertainment?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] It's a very important question for us because if one of our services is not popular, that means that the service is not that good, but maybe we have made a mistake in terms of selecting an industry or we're doing something wrong or -- and the number of products for one unique customer is a very important indicator that we are going to monitor closely. And obviously, the more products there are, the better.</p><p>But there is another important thing. You talk about individual retail customers, but there are many customers that are legal entities, corporate customers. And I would remind you that we want not only to optimize their costs and mitigate risks, but we want to make sure that they have better revenues. The heads of these companies present here on the stage, they work a lot. So they work extensively with other companies in the country whom they can help.</p><p>And as for the B2B and B2C part, we have a great synergies with Sberbank as well as between the companies. Something that the guys were talking about. They did not wait for the elements to be rolled out. They started to cross-promote each other. And there are many signages there like you watch football match, you can deliver -- you can have a pizza delivery. You're going on a taxi, you can watch Okko online cinema. You can get -- you can buy a select a TV on the Yandex market and get a subscription for Okko and so on and so forth. We want to make sure that each service would drive another service. And it's a great responsibility because if a service is not that attractive, is not that high quality, would decrease the number of customers, not increase them. So we are going to monitor that. NPS, CSI, for each of these services are key indicators, the ability and capacity of the server -- of the service to speed up and drive the system, these are the things that are very important for us.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Another question? First row.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Mikael Terence] from [Serene Capital]. Mr. Khasis, sir, at the start of the presentation, you said about 20 -- more than 20 -- there are more than 25 elements that unite the ecosystem parts. What are the examples?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] For instance, Sber ID, we do not want a customer to identify himself when he locks in a service. He needs to be able to use his Sber ID, log in any service and without entering any new data, they should be able to make a transaction, make a purchase and so on and so forth.</p><p>Support service, that's another element of our ecosystem. This is Sber 247, 247 means 24/7. So these are all means of customer support. So if a person calls us with a question related to one service, we should not say, no, this is another phone for this service customer care service. No, it should be totally seamless, talking about the profile of a customer we should understand that we should leverage the knowledge that we have about our products and match them with the needs and preferences of the customers. So there are many elements like that.</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>or Sber API registry. These are the tools that help companies to connect to this or that services in a seamless manner. The majority of services are local services, I'd like to remind you that, and the goal for 2020, 2021 is to find a possibility to make sure that local service providers are able to connect to our applications to deliver services to businesses and to retail customers alike. So this is going to be this kind of a technology platform, seamless plug-and-play without loan integration efforts. So this is what we're focusing on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Two more questions about branches and the synergies. I was quite intrigued with Okko example. Where -- can there be any other examples in terms of synergy between the branches and ecosystem? And what happened with Bringly? What were the lessons learned?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] As for Bringly, I will give the floor to Maksim. As for the synergy, well, there might be many synergies really. As I said, one of the very important drivers of the popularity of our mobile apps is that in our brick-and-mortar branches, we educated people. We would raise awareness on how to use our services. And we say to these people, thank you for coming to our branch, but actually, you can come -- you can receive the same service without going to the branch, and the branch has made a great contribution in making sure that the digital services of Sberbank are in top 3 Russian apps. We are only lagging behind Instagram and WhatsApp, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of the popularity of the app. So I think that our branches can play a great role in raising awareness among our services.</p><p>We can educate people how to use our services, like e-commerce, taxi delivery, and so on and so forth. Second insight is that our branch is a physical world. We cannot ignore the physical world. We see that many Western and Chinese ecosystems start to understand that they need kind of a physical touch in the physical world, like logistics, and we have a large project -- Sber logistics has a large project together with Beru in our branches.</p><p>You will have an opportunity soon to receive an order, return it, if this piece of clothes was not your size, for instance, or do many other things, logistical things. Consulting, other services, I think that in many ways we have to reinvent the work of our brick-and-mortar branches to make sure that this tremendous network that we have is not our cost-generating liability, but an asset that will generate a great value. And if you look at the branches, [no woman] majority of our branches, a good, a great number of our branches are branches in rural net areas. And sometimes, their people work part-time, but that's the only window to this great world of opportunities, to those who live in these rural, remote areas. And we obviously want to make this world better and more exciting for these people.</p><p>As for Bringly, I would like Maksim to comment.</p><p>MAKSIM GRISHAKOV: [Interpreted] Bringly was an experiment. Now there were some products from other countries and with an average check that is higher compared with the products from China. We understood that it does not -- that the investments cannot be -- are not reasonable. We can work with these projects when we see some light in the end of the tunnel.</p><p>In Bringly, we didn't see any many promising things, was not the best idea. The competitors that are competitors already with low margins. But we decided to kind of pause this effort. But Beru is an option. There is a traffic with customers and orders. So we're going to test various things. So this chart of this year as a high-tech company, we are proud of having an opportunity to close some experiments. Some experiments would work, some not, and you have to accept the fact that some of them were not successful.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. We have a question at the last row? And another question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Yes, the question to Mr. Khasis. Question for the costs for the ecosystem, it doubled in 2019. Was 2019 the record high year in terms of the costs or we should expect the same rate of growth? And are there any threshold in terms of the expenses on the ecosystem?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: Thank you for your question. 2019 was a year that was very significant in terms of entering new industries in 2019. We entered the industries -- large industries as media and other industries. And as I have mentioned during my presentation, I said that I don't think there are new industries that would require the similar level of investments that we did in 2019. Yes, there might be some targeted investment efforts, but we do not plan to enter any new huge industries that would require huge -- that would be very capital-intensive, like private equity and other things. So I think I have answered this question during my presentation, actually.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. Another question from the first row, and there are another 2 questions. Yes, [Mikhail], please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] I have one question about Yandex market. Could you please tell about the profitability trend, the huge growth? Does the economy improve EBITDA margin? Does that improve? And what is this driven by?</p><p>MAKSIM GRISHAKOV: [Interpreted] So yes, in this year, you know that Yandex market is a profitable business. Beru is an investment business, investment-intensive business. Through this -- throughout this year, we have improved drastically the economy for one order in Beru, and it's related to 2 things. First of all, to improvement the procurement services, together with the larger scale, you can buy products with lower prices. There is an increase of the share of products that we sell as part of the marketplace, where we do not actually own the goods, but we get the fee from the -- those who sell them. So we -- that improved the margin of the business. And we decreased the logistical costs and logistical costs, we decreased it by 40% throughout the year. So the combination of these factors improved our economy and gives us a total -- an understanding that we're going to breakeven very soon, and we're going to drive the bottom line very soon.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. There was a question on the first row. [Mikhail], and a question from webcast. Yes, no, sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) from Autonomous. Regarding the investments in so many different mail companies and Yandex companies that are seemingly competitors with each other, like when you think about Citymobil, Yandex Taxi, Delivery Club, Yandex EDA, do you find any conflicts of interest in investing in such similar companies? And what's the end goal? I mean, perhaps merging both of them?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Yes, obviously, we have a great experience of working with companies with whom we cooperate within some projects, but compete in other projects. For instance, in e-commerce, we are working together with Yandex, yet in O2O, we work with Mail. Ru. Yandex, for instance, Mobility is working with Uber and competing with us. But the role of Sberbank in Russia is so huge that we cannot build this vertical monopoly because we're always accused of that, of trying to build a monopoly. But we try to be as open as possible and we cooperate with the various players of the markets. So we give an opportunity to different financial institutions and various companies of the industry to work with us.</p><p>You can pay by any option in any of the service. So that doesn't mean that we entered the system and only Sberbank payment systems can be used. No, they use any payment providers. And in this sense, it gives us a strength, actually, because we now have an opportunity to engage diverse companies and we can benefit from the strength of these companies. So as I said before, we have joint ventures with A&amp;NN Holding with -- headed by Alexander Mamut that's Rambler, and with Mail. Ru. These are the 2 businesses that we have been discussing today. And with Yandex, in terms of Yandex. Market and Yandex. Money, AFK Sistema, we have a joint venture with (inaudible) called VisionLabs. And CRT, that's our joint venture with Gazprombank. I can go on with this list. I think that this is a good approach.</p><p>The approach when we do not build the structure when there is like this 100% is Sberbank, we're not like this snow-plowing machine that we get everything. No, we want to work with the partners. We want to share the risks, share the investments, at the same time, share the benefits, the profits. And we think that by working in this large range of companies, we deliver great value for our customers, for our shareholders. And we think that this approach is a good approach for Sberbank.</p><p>That does not mean that this approach works for everyone, but for Sberbank, given our market position and our significance for the country, we think that this is the only right approach. And besides that, having partners. And being -- and our noncontrolling stake in these businesses remove the potential restriction related to making sure that these companies can go to the IPO. So this is another factor to think about.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. Next question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Maybe this question would add on the previous question. A question about regulation. It was the major page of the banking business that really driven you to the ecosystem. Now the Central Bank starts to address the possibility of banks to build ecosystems. You all know about the situation, right? I mean, how do you estimate and evaluate this risk and how can Sberbank respond to this regulation from this point of view?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Well, I think that it's not only a Russian thing, Russian character. States think more and more about how to regulate the digital environment. And in this relation, we are not an exception as a country. And I think that the regulation here is much more liberal than, for instance, in China. But in relation to that, I can say the following. We are a law-abiding company. We are always in line with all regulations and laws in every country of presence.</p><p>If there is a new regulation passed in Russia, we're going to comply with that. But we do hope that any regulation would cater for the interest of the country and the people, and everything we do is making sure that these interests are upheld. So we really hope that this -- in this regulation would not be a headwind. Might be some wins from the site, might be some problems, but we do not think that there will be some outright restrictions or some outright actions from the government that would forbid us to service our customers better.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. [Mikhail]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Now I wanted to ask a question to all panels, the panel experts. Could you ask -- raise your hand if you expect a positive unit economy from your business next year?</p><p>MAKSIM GRISHAKOV: [Interpreted] Okay. Positive unit economics isn't that you earn money for the orders except given the acquisition costs and everything else. And in figures, there are 2 elements to the platform. One is the positive and the other is investment. I mean, some businesses and some businesses invest. There are different stages of development for every city. So positive economics -- unit economics, on average, there will not be. But in some parts of the business, we will have it. Okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] And perhaps, okay, 1 and 3, we had, what about 5 years down the line? Okay, great. Then the question to Mr. Khasis. When we heard the first part presentation in the first half of the day, we understood that in the first part of the -- I mean in the ecosystem, the finance products, obviously, the most profitable even when the attendant businesses are going to hit the positive unit economics, and hopefully that will positively contribute to the bottom line. How is this going to affect the ROE for Sberbank shareholders?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] In terms of guidance for ROE, we always assumed that any investment of ours cannot give us lower ROE than the average that just came together. So we envisage about 20-plus of what's there. And if we invest in any businesses of the sort, we are supposed to increase the average ROE and not see it go down as so much as goals are concerned. And only Yandex, as we know, just Yandex is preparing the IPO of Yandex. Taxi, and you know the valuations that are expected.</p><p>I think, I mean, even if Yandex does that, other -- our businesses are going to positively contribute to the shareholder value on the Sberbank stock that is today. I think this is one of the main drivers of our interest here because it's not the category view that gets evaluated, you also factor in the assessment of the forecast.</p><p>Alexander Vladimirovich Morozov is taking the floor after me, you can address those questions to him. But on the whole, we have been saying the same things at our initial presentation in 2017. We would like the banking business to see the nonbanking business emerge on its side and investments into the nonbanking business should take a similar value over a long-term horizon. And this vision has not really changed. I mean the more successful companies we get, we -- the more we are convinced that this is positive, that this can be done.</p><p>If you compare the value of Netflix with the value of the largest U.S. banks, it's not a fact that the bank is going to win, never mind the e-commerce. Pretty much any e-commerce company in the United States or China is valued higher than the largest bank.</p><p>I'm just repeating the point that our creation of ecosystem, investment including, creates a total win situation, win, win, win. The society will win, the customers will win, the shareholders will win, I'm confident in that. Our employees are going to win. Instead of looking for another job, they will have the opportunity of just taking up something else. And I can see that this might be a good situation, a positive situation and inspiring us in our work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Yes. Mr. Khasis, one more clarification, the very important requirement set, at least 20% IRR. Am I right in saying that this IRR is going to be achieved in capital gained as opposed to bottom line contribution? So basically spending that until the businesses are taken to the public market?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] No, not necessarily. We do not intend to take more of the companies public. And even the examples that I cited, it's not a commitment on our part. To go public, several factors must come together.</p><p>The company must be ready, the market must be good, et cetera. I spoke about opportunities. If we speak about 100% ownership of the company or if a company is too strategically important for us, like SberCloud, we do not plan to take SberCloud to an IPO separately. But we think that in a lot of cases, the contribution of these companies to our investment must be ensured with the profit that they're going to earn. Many of them have much lower returns versus the banking ROE. If the cost to income in the bank is very attractive.</p><p>Sber Solutions, they will probably not work with EBITDA more than 7% or 8%, but this is a business that does not require a lot of capital. So in this sense, this business can give you very good returns to the equity invested through the profit that they generate, through the dividends that we get -- that we're going to get. There are a whole string of companies that we get the dividends already that they are profitable -- that are already profitable. So answering your questions, in the overall overwhelming minority of cases, we see the return on the investment through certain liquidity events like IPO. In the absolute majority of cases, we see the returns in the discounted cash flow, in the profit that they're going to generate.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. We need to round up this element. I'm going to take the final question here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Over 400 people are watching us worldwide, so why don't we pay respects to them? Mr. Khasis, why did Sberbank decide to buy the majority of voting shares in Mail. Ru via the joint foundation and not based on the open source -- [the speaker is not heard]. Apparently, the stake you bought is about twice more expensive than the Gazprombank looked about a year ago. And then the Mail. Ru shares fell 30% in the intervening period. Why did you have to pay that much?</p><p>KHASIS LEV ARONOVICH: [Interpreted] I answered this question already when we announced the transaction, when we announced the deal, when we said that the binding documents were signed. Let me explain that again.</p><p>Probably the previous answers either were not clear enough, so thank you again for the opportunity to give this clarification again.</p><p>The value of the deal in a market economy is always a product of willingness of the parties. We would be happy to buy it cheaper, but we were not able to buy cheaper because Gazprombank took a very simple position. This was a price at which we bought. We think that Mail. Ru is dramatically undervalued. On all the fundamental metrics, it should be valued higher. So the current market sentiment that brought down the price cannot be the basis. So we were not -- they were not able to sell below the price that we eventually bought it at. That was the pricing.</p><p>What our rationale was -- was that we are creating a huge joint venture with Mail. Ru, and it is very promising. Secondly, for us, as the ecosystem of Sberbank, it is highly interesting to interact with the ecosystem of Mail. Ru. And this is a whole ecosystem, and very successful one at that on a whole number of areas. And for us, we are much more at peace if we have a much larger stake in that. We do not assume that we want control. We have never tried to gain control. But having a person on the Board of Mail. Ru and having the ability to influence the decisions, certain strategic decisions in Mail. Ru, that was important for us, and that was the rationale. Plus, you should remember that we reached the agreement with Mail. Ru, and this is public information again, that in some time, we're going to have a choice: either we keep our stake as is and we keep it as JV or we take our O2O business public or perhaps we take certain parts of the O2O business, certain -- Delivery Club separately and Citi Mobile separately. And also, as part of that agreement, we have the option to convert our share in a JV into a certain economic stake in Mail. Ru.</p><p>So yes, we have that option. And you have to look at this deal as a whole. You don't look at it piece by piece, JV separately and everything else separately. You need to look at this as a whole. So yes, the probability is there that in several years, as the agreement stipulates, we might be interested in selling either all of it or part of it or in exchanging that stake for something -- for some stake in Mail. Ru. But we have a very positive outlook of the market prospects of Mail. Ru. We think it is very undervalued, both in terms of its potential and their performance. I think people should reappraise their performance, and we're going to help actively. We're going to help Mail. Ru to develop as a self-standing business, as I've said, and we have a lot of overlapping domains. We have a lot of potential to interact and capture a lot of synergies that's going to benefit all our shareholders and all our customers, obviously. So thank you.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Unfortunately, we are very much off the schedule. You can ask a lot of questions off the record in the lobby. We are bringing up this part of the session. Thank you, speakers, for handling a lot of questions.</p><p>Now the program is this: since we are off schedule, I suggest we adjourn very briefly, 15 minutes for lunch, and then we can continue. And after that -- and then we can have a long lunch with an off-the-record discussion for whoever is interested, okay? Okay, 15-minute break.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>LEV KHASIS, FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, SUBSIDIARY BANK SBERBANK OF RUSSIA JOINT-STOCK COMPANY: (technical difficulty)</p><p>[Interpreted] We have the right. It's not a derivative. It's a right for us to put it to the Board of Mail. Ru. And if the mechanism emerges as beneficial to both of us, that is not an unconditional option because I could have been -- I was -- it was possible to interpret me differently.</p><p>So thank you very much. You can obviously clarify all the questions through IR. Thank you very much for talking with you, for the opportunity.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Yes, Lev, thanks very much for participating, and I would suggest that Dzhangir, given that we are badly off schedule, I would suggest that he cut short his presentation just to keep some time for the Q&amp;A.</p><p>On risk, Dzhangir?</p><p>DZHANGIR DZHANGIROV, SENIOR VP &amp; HEAD OF RISK, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Good afternoon, dear colleagues, and we presented the end of third quarter figures at the call summing up the Q3 so I'll probably skip the main messages since we discussed them. We saw those. Stage 3 loans are 7.9%. The cost of risk this year for the 3 years is 0.72%. These are pretty decent figures. We look at them as the figures that are better than the market, especially on cost of risk.</p><p>On COR, we are assisted this year by the unwinding of the provisions for Agrokor. If that was not the case, COR would have been a bit higher. After the sale of DenizBank, 95% of the risk is on the balance sheet. Of course, Sberbank, we're the main risk-taker. As for the risk metrics on the portfolio, you're going to see that they are pretty much stable. Some things are noteworthy: Stage 3 loans coverage is 73%.</p><p>We often pre-provision, not when the loan hits 90 plus or when certain other visible impairment happens, we provision in advance. We generally follow a weighted conservative line. And so the dynamic of cost of risk, for the end of the year, our guidance was about 100, maybe 110 basis points. At the end of the year, it might be actually a bit lower than that.</p><p>As for retail, the cost of risk was a bit higher. That is explained by a change in accounting. We are now applying IFRS 9 methodology. This is also explained by the fact that the risk in this market, in the unsecured lending market, went a bit higher. The corporate lending, quite obviously, the shrinkage of cost of risk is a decrease explained by one-off unwinding of Agrokor provisions. For the next year, our guidance is going to be 100, maybe 110 bps. We think that this corridor is a stable band for us for this year and the next.</p><p>As for RWA density, there are always a lot of questions on that. This year, perhaps the most important one-off that affected it, those were the macro prudential cushions introduced by the Central Bank. We decided to reflect those in our IFRS capital adequacy report that already led to the increase of RWA density this year. In the fourth quarter, there will be a slight growth as well. And next year, we expect the macroprudential cushions will continue to negatively affect RWA density because the loans are going to be amortizing and the new loans are going to be coming in with new weights.</p><p>Also, as an IRB bank, we see those cushions a bit less than the rest of the banking system for -- so for similar banks, RWA is actually higher. This is the estimate we see for the end of the year: 97%. Yet, I have to say, I have to add that right now we filed several things with the Central Bank for the retail and the corporate business segments. And we had a rather positive discussion with the Central Bank already this year. We expect the approvals on those requests, and there's even a scenario we're under -- already this year, we're going to get the approval, the final approval, for using new models. In this case, we will materially improve RWA density, but because there's very little time left until the end of the year, there is a strong chance that that's going to happen next year in the first quarter.</p><p>Also next year, we will continue transitioning to IRB, transitioning other segments to IRB. In light of certain specificity of the segments, I don't expect any material unwinding of RWA. The effect is probably going to be neutral. Having said that, we are discussing a transition to Basel 3.5 with the Central Bank. And SMA on operating risk, that is also on the cards. If you factor all that in, the already existing requests, Basel 3.5 and the potential transition to SMA, I expect our RWA density to be around 93%.</p><p>Now as for the corporate loan portfolio, you saw those dynamics. The absolute volume of the portfolio in foreign exchange fell since 2016. If you look at the share of foreign exchange versus the rest of the portfolio, it actually fell deeper. In the credit policy, we designated quite clearly that foreign exchange lending is only subject to the existence of actual foreign exchange revenue, so I don't really expect that share to grow. As for the retail portfolio, it has been growing at a rather quick pace. And we are seeing that the risk that is formed in our portfolio that is materially and sometimes several multiples better than the risk in the rest of the banking system.</p><p>We have not -- we did not show that before, but this shows the dynamic on the digital metrics in the retail lending process. The white tables, that's the things that we do in digital channels. The light blue, that's the loans approved on the 0/11 fields technology, either no questionnaire at all or a very brief questionnaire. And the deep blue, that's the share of the loans that we decide in real time. That's about 2 minutes. In 2014, we did not use to have those technologies. At this time, all these metrics are pretty high up. The share of loans in digital channel at 71%, that's customer channels -- that's customer choice. 71% of customers come to the digital channels. So those metrics -- this metric is going to depend on customer behavior.</p><p>As for the other 2 metrics, this is our technology that allows us to make decisions, on one hand, close to real time, 90% of the traffic, and 80% of the customers don't fill in any fields in the questionnaire. And the target is obviously make it 100%, but that will probably be never achieved. There are always certain exceptions, some more complicated loans to make. I don't think both of these metrics are going to go way above 90%. And the goal is to move closer to 100% level.</p><p>As for the PTI, as the question that is quite often asked, we see the growth of the PTI for our portfolio. Recently, the Central Bank has issued an analytical report on the loan lending burden for the retail customers, so they see that the burden is going nearer to the levels of 2014. We think that the PTI is not the only metric that shows you the creditworthiness of a customer, and we see some new opportunities in retail. Given the risk that we have, given the fact that we use multiple models, not only the PTI metric, we see huge opportunities, quite large opportunities on this market.</p><p>I'll skip some of the slides to save time. This is the mortgage portfolio, the LTV for mortgage portfolio. And an interesting thing here is NPL90+ on the 12th payment installment, depending on the LTV at the issuance. Thanks to strategy, we maintain and manage the risk, and the risk for LTV that's higher than 80% is sometimes even lower than compared with other categories of LTV.</p><p>Talking about the collection, quite stable metrics here. They're quite high, still quite high. And as for the retail lending, we see the growth of hazards in NPL90+ for the entire portfolio. This metric is growing across the banking system. It is growing, and across the banking sector, it is 2x higher.</p><p>Now I'd like to talk about our lending opportunities and capacity. This year, we have made a record-high number of loans approved. 403,000 applications were reviewed. That is 2x higher than the previous record. It's not only about -- the thing is not about the capacity. The thing is about the fact that we are using a totally new architecture that helps us to process a lot of transactional data online. And these are heavy data, and we can use complicated models. And this technology is scalable. So we do not rule out the opportunity, the possibility of our capacity would grow double-fold. Actually, we're not even -- we even target the double-fold growth here.</p><p>We use various models and strategies and approaches. In risk management, we're not only working with data and models, we're applying different strategies. We use different models for interest rate and limit determination. There are the entire cascades of models that are used that help us to ensure the good combination of risk and yields. The use of all of these models and approaches helped us to drive down the manual labor. And this 90% of near-real-time decisions for 400,000 applications is basically, of course, the result of the working model and working strategy and has helped us to reduce the headcount three- or fourfold, 3 or 4x yet.</p><p>We have a new role: fraud analyst. So in the loan portfolio, we don't look at the application, the specific application. We look at the level of fraud, and we analyze the incoming flow. So this figure is going to go down, and this figure is going to go up. As for the corporate lending process for small and micro businesses, we have -- we implemented last year an approach that we called the digital Evergreen limits. This is a technology that helps to determine limits for customers. 2 million SME companies in Russia have these limits. And basically, businesses can select the customers with whom they want to work from a huge pool of customers. The pool of customers with whom you can work is 2 million. And the share of automated decisions within this process is quite high. Currently, it's 15%, and it is going to grow further. That's it for me, and I'm ready for questions. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Just 3 questions. I think we'll have time for 3 questions. Okay. Andrey has a question, Olga and Mikhail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] If you look at the performance of cost of risk for the first 9 months, as you put it correctly, there were 2 major one-offs, first of all, due to Agrokor reprovisioning and, at the same time, the provisions related to the oil refinery. But there is a kind of an underlying of cost of risk of about 70 basis points. Your guidance is 100, 110 basis points for the next year. It looks like a very ultraconservative guidance. What should happen again, some refinery problem again or some retail boom or -- because the PTI is doing okay. I mean what do you -- why do you have such a high conservative guidance?</p><p>DZHANGIR DZHANGIROV: [Interpreted] Well, I perhaps would not comment on the cases, on these specific cases. We're using the portfolio approach in our analysis, and these metrics are done by the calculation. So the idea behind that is the following: We know what is our portfolio right now. We have been giving rankings to the customers. So we have been rating customers for quite a long time so we have a probability of default and we might predict how the portfolio will look like in the next year.</p><p>At the same time, we calculate the loans that we can deliver next year. And we have the ratings of this lending, and this is how we get the metrics for the provisions. This is what we do. A priori, we do not think that there will be some major deterioration for the large loans. So this is the portfolio approach that we are using here. And actually, for last year, cost of risk was about 118 basis points. If it was not for Agrokor, it will be like these one-off effects of the previous period. The cost of risk will be -- would not be at 0.72%. I think that during the year, it will be higher than 0.72% though.</p><p>So I really cannot say that given the Agrokor situation and given the fact that in Q4 -- I don't have the presentation working. But in Q4, our cost of risk, when this decrease happened due to Agrokor, it is growing. It has been growing in Q4. It is going to grow further because this is the analyzed metric that factors in the Agrokor situation. So I expect the cost of risk to be higher.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Dzhangir, you can show the diagram.</p><p>DZHANGIR DZHANGIROV: [Interpreted] Here it is. You see, it was a decrease, steep decrease, and then it went up, and it is going to go up a bit.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay, thank you. Next question?</p><p>ANDREY MIKHAILOV: [Interpreted] Andrey Mikhailov from Sova Capital. I have the question about the loans to the military. I know that there is a discussion to write off them. And the Vice Premier who is supervising that is pushing for writing off half of them and the restructuring of the other loans, the interest rate of 2% for the next 5 years. What would be the P&amp;L effect if such an arrangement is materialized? And is it in the guidance in terms of the cost of risk for the next year?</p><p>DZHANGIR DZHANGIROV: [Interpreted] Now you're talking about the military? Okay. We have quite high-quality portfolio. I do not expect these write-offs. Something that you're talking about is kind of a dramatically dramatic situation. We do not think this scenario would materialize. Any pass-through of the assets will be based on the market price, and the market price does not mean that you had that -- you said that half of them would be written off and half of them would be what?</p><p>ANDREY MIKHAILOV: [Interpreted] Would have an interest rate of 2%.</p><p>DZHANGIR DZHANGIROV: [Interpreted] No, we do not expect that, for sure. We have a high-quality portfolio. And write-off in 2% seems some incredible, fantastic figures. I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. Next question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] A question about PTI. On the chart, there is a growth of -- dynamic growth, 7 percentage points in 2 quarters. And your comment that you're comfortable with the growth of the PTI, does that mean that you continue to see a higher growth dynamic for the unsecured consumer loans? Do you have some expectations about this dynamic for 2020? And the same slide had a cost of risk in retail. Do you think the cost of risk -- will it change only in retail in 2020 against 2019 or in some other areas?</p><p>DZHANGIR DZHANGIROV: [Interpreted] No, I do not expect our PTI to grow that steeply. You need to understand that PTI in this period in 2015, 2016 and even 2017 was decreasing quite steeply in -- for us and for the banking system. In 2014, there was a devaluation of the ruble, interest rate hike, and all banks made their credit policies much stricter. And then they were much more conservative in terms of giving out loans. So this deterioration in 2015, 2016, this plummeting related to the stricter policies and the PTI in the system would be higher than this 40%.</p><p>I do not expect this figure to be -- to grow significantly. It will not grow significantly because we are nearing the record-high levels. That's the first reason. Second reason is that new macroprudential buffers impose great fines related to the capital. And for us, these are -- these effects are significant. And as for the other banking system, these effects are even more significant. So I expect the banks to make their policies stricter in relation to the high PTIs. As for the forecast for the growth of the portfolio for the next year, the Central Bank announced that next year, it is expecting it to grow by 10%. We have the same expectations: 10%.</p><p>As for cost of risk this year in our policies, we have implemented some amendments. We not only look at the level of loans with the burden, but we look at the growth of the burden. If we see that some customers have more and more loans, we limit the lending for those customers who have higher burden, and this burden is growing very quickly. I think that the retail growth, the growth in retail here will be on the level of previous year.</p><p>As for the slowing down, the slowdown might have double effect. So if the slowdown is -- there is a slowdown in -- the major slowdown in the growth of consumer lending, the cost of risk might actually increase. I mean there might be an opposite effect. So -- but I think that the level will be, in 2020, will be the same as the level of 2019.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you very much. I think that this was it about the risks. We'll have a large Q&amp;A session. The Director of Integrated Risks, Alexey Bogatov, will stay with you for the large Q&amp;A session, and he will be able to answer your questions related to risks. Thank you very much, and have a good day.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted]So we have 2 more presentations, and then we're going to have a large Q&amp;A session: Oleg Zamulin, the Head of Macroeconomic Research Center, and then we are going to have Alexander Morozov in Q&amp;A session.</p><p>OLEG ZAMULIN, HEAD &amp; SENIOR MD OF MACROECONOMIC RESEARCH CENTRE, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted]Good afternoon, dear colleagues. Well, given the fact that we are moving -- that we are not within the time schedule, I'm going to be very quick in terms of how macroeconomic trends, understanding that we are going to look at the global economy and the Russian economy, and this is the data that we put in our business plan.</p><p>So first of all, how can you characterize 2019 compared to 2018? Well, we know that the economic growth has slowed down significantly after the unexpected high growth of 2.3%. This year, we expect it to be just a little bit more than 1%. And the surprise is that the inflation that was -- the Central Bank expected at a level of 5% in the start of the year will be a little bit more than 3%. I would say that this year, especially the mid part of this year, was characterized by quite pessimistic expectations. It was related to the big situation in the global economy that slowed down. It was related to world trade wars and with the expectations of the global recession for 2020, now these expectations were somewhat mitigated. There's less and less debate and talk about that yet. So the global growth by the end of the year will be lower than that compared with the previous year. But for our economy, the other things were very -- were different and significant.</p><p>First, monetary policy and budget policy were tightened. There was a VAT hike combined with the tax collection. That means that a lot of money were taken from the economy. And this effort started in the start of the year. There was the lag in terms of state expenses and high interest rates that were put by the Central Bank at the start of the year. So this tight monetary policy led to the slowdown of the economy and then, therefore, slowdown of the inflation. Nevertheless, these negative trends by the end of the year started to materialize and go reverse. So we saw a growth by 1.7% of GDP. We even saw the increase of the growth in retail. That means that the consumers started to spend money, so that means kind of a revival of the economy.</p><p>The inflation, at the same time, did not respond. It is much lower than the target of the Central Bank. So year-on-year, in November, the inflation was 3.5%, but which is -- the thing that is more important that if we look at the current inflation, the average inflation level in the last 3 years, seasonally adjust -- 3 months seasonally adjusted, we'll see that the inflation is around 1% and the basic inflation is around 2%. So this is one of the major arguments in favor of the expectation of a further interest rate reduction by the Central Bank, which is expected by many analysts. But I'm going to talk about that later.</p><p>Now the budget policy. As I have mentioned before, the major blow for the economy this year was the VAT hike and increase of the collection of the tax. In 9 months of this year, the budget surplus consolidated was more than 5% of GDP compared to 4.6% last year. But last year, there were higher oil prices so if the surplus this year is higher than the previous year, given that the oil prices went down, it is a signal that the monetary policy's very tight. That was primarily explained by the higher income to the budget, and to a lesser degree, that was explained by expenses. Expenses grew, but to a lesser degree than income.</p><p>However, we also see positive dynamics here. If you look at the monthly spending of the federal budget, that spending was the lowest at the middle of the year between May and July. And starting from August, there was a considerable acceleration that only picked up the pace with every passing month. That is explained by the fact that most of the spending in the national projects, I mean there was a lot of gearing up to do. So now all those national projects are catching up, and the government is simply catching up on the spending that was underdone in the beginning and the middle of the year.</p><p>If you look at the regional budgets, this is a distribution of the surplus and deficit regional budgets, and most of the budgets are in the plus. But we see the number of regions in the surplus is about the same as in 2018 so there's no lagging behind the previous years. So we expect that by the end of the year, most of this budgetary driven -- budget-driven surplus is going to go away. And a lot of budget funds will hit the economy, which will also mean a certain acceleration, an acceleration of inflation within the next couple of months.</p><p>In response to this slowing inflation, the Central Bank, as was to be expected, responded with a really quick decrease of the key rate, 4 times consecutively. The most recent time was by 0.5%. And again, as I said, inflation is very low. And that's why a lot -- most of the analysts expect 1 or 2 further decreases, including a decrease on the next Friday. The argument in favor of lower rates has weakened considerably in light of the data that I've cited, the data on retail trade and on public spending. Very likely is a situation when the Central Bank simply takes a pause. Since expense has grown, it's legitimate to take a pause and see how that affects inflation.</p><p>Yet in our projection, we factor in another 2 decreases of the key rate, this Friday and in the first quarter of next. Yes, let's see what decision is going to be on Friday. I think it's going to be a completely unpredictable meeting. It's very difficult to project what the Central Bank is going to do. This is our baseline scenario. Perhaps the main charts are on the right-hand side. This year, it's going to be a 1% growth. It's going to accelerate to 1.7% next year; and in 2021 and '22, the economy is going to be on a more stable trajectory at over 2% growth. Inflation is going to be just under the target next year because it is pretty low these days. Yes, in the next couple of years, we expect it to be on the target of the Central Bank. The key rate, we expect it to fall down to 6.25% by the end of the first quarter -- sorry, by the end of this week, and to 6% by the end of the second -- in the first quarter where it's going to stay.</p><p>I'm going to keep this slide as a background, and I'm prepared to field the questions now. I think Alexander Morozov is going to follow. And then the Q&amp;A session is going to be a joint one after that. Alexander, please?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Good afternoon, colleagues. I hope we have not bored you to death completely. I'm going to have very few pictures but a lot of figures, so hopefully, you have missed those.</p><p>Very quickly, the first slide, this is how we see the sector growth. This is how we see Sberbank. On retail and on deposits -- on retail lending and on deposits, we see ourselves to be in line with the sector. The only aspect where we see ourselves a bit better is in mortgages and corporate loans as a whole. We think that next year, we might be -- we have a good chance to be just above the banking system as a whole and materially better than this year.</p><p>If you look at the structure of our balance sheet, you will see that the proportion of retail loans is increasing, which is great. The proportion of small business loans is also increasing, which is again very good because it's a high-margin product. On the liability side, we see the increase of current accounts in retail deposits without contractual maturities, which is the cheapest source of deposits, the cheapest source of liabilities. That is what gives us the best idea of our margin, interest rate margin.</p><p>And perhaps this is a key slide of my entire presentation. This is our guidance between 5.1% and 5.3% for the next year. This slide merits a bit more attention. Now throughout this year, we have been working on maintaining and rebuilding our margin. A whole number of factors that we analyzed in great detail at the conference calls contributed to a lot of pressure that the margin came under in the beginning of the year. The introduction of the IFRS 9 slightly muted the figures that we gave in the outset of the year. And the whole number of effects that we have been mentioning already, sometimes, the unwinding of the provisions -- provisioning in some assets. And those are big assets, they are quite big; interest income and expense was quite considerable.</p><p>But just to explain this swing here. If you take off the one-off effects, the margin should have been like this. Sorry, I do apologize. So if you look at what has been happening right now, since the beginning of the year, actually since the second quarter, we have been having visibility of this since mid-year and especially in August reporting, we have been rebuilding the interest margin. This will continue. It continued in November. It will continue in December, and we expect the peak of the margin -- interest margin to be hit at the beginning of next year. This is a very important statement. We are going to the level -- actually above the level that we've started this year with, despite everything that's been going on in the market.</p><p>If you look at the slide, next year, the income on loan portfolio, the corporate portfolio and the retail portfolio with respect to the mortgages, that's going to be decreasing inevitably, but that's going to be a managed decrease. Yet, we are seeing that this decrease is the same in the liability side, both the individuals and the corporate side. And because we are transitioning to the higher-margin segment of retail lending and the higher-margin segment of ruble lending, and since we are improving the overall loan-to-deposit ratio, there's more working assets. There's more -- there's a greater share of small lending and mortgage and non-mortgage and more current accounts. All of that really contributes to a rather high net interest income or better said, net interest margin multiplied by the accelerated growth in the lending, that has been shown in line with the sector or slightly above. That's going to be a better net interest income.</p><p>So in this sense, we are pretty optimistic about the next year despite the factors will continue to pressure downward. These are the factors like slowdown in unsecured consumer loans, definitely. The overall decrease in the interest rate levels. And obviously, the lower LDR, system-wide, and specifically with respect to foreign exchange loans.</p><p>On the rubles as a whole and the overall LDR at the bank has been growing, so our job has to rebuild slightly. And we see, at the end of the last quarter, that we are able to do. We are pulling up the LDR in the foreign exchange to that marker. Also going on, very importantly, it's important to understand that -- and I've said that on conference calls, we have been and still are positively exposed to the further decrease of the interest rate. The structure of our interest rate gap is that we are gaining from a decrease in the interest rate of a 1-year horizon between RUB 25 billion and RUB 28 billion in interest income. That structure is the repricing of our assets and liabilities. In this sense, since we expect a further decrease of the rate, in this sense, we expect the next year to be, in this sense, more fortunate for us. So if you look at our average NIM again, this guidance means practically, in practical terms, a flattish picture versus the current year, the expiring year.</p><p>Now fees and commissions. Here, we have a rather good, healthy growing business, healthily growing business. It was important for me to have a double-digit figure here, 10%-plus. Next year, we expect the same double-digit growth on fees and commissions. Despite the market reaching a saturation point, this is no longer the market where we started at some point. Despite the penetration of the card business has been growing, despite pretty much every quarter, if not every month, some new initiatives come up that are already priced in by the market and by the regulator, things to regulate are increasingly few, we still expect this market to grow, and we still expect further growth in transactions with cards and growth in the fees and commissions income related to that.</p><p>We also expect an accelerated growth in documentary transactions, trade finance where we are focusing. Our share, until recently, had been at an unwarrantedly low level. We are aiming to rectify this. There's a whole number of regulatory things, regulatory headwinds. You all know them. They will all affect the downward -- they will all affect down -- a downward pressure on the interest income.</p><p>Why we are showing it here? If we factor out these articles, other things being equal, apple-to-apple, the growth of our fees and commissions income is going to -- would have been mid-teens. So a lowering from the mid-teens to a 10%-plus, that is the result of the changes that have been going on or are the changes that have been expected with respect to the regulation of the relevant businesses. It's very important for us -- having said all that, it's very important for us that our fees and commissions income is increasingly able to cover our OpEx. 69% is essentially a level that we achieved and we intend to stay at this level. We do not intend to go below that. That's a very important figure. Actually, today, very few financial institutions in the world can boast a figure even close to this, never mind a better figure than this.</p><p>And if you talk about our share of fees income in the OpEx, of operating income, that's at least 24%. This is going to be helped by the double-digit growth of fees and commissions income and the lowering of our interest income. When I spoke about the interest income, that guidance is covering the year as a whole. Again as a dynamic, it is in a quarterly -- I mean quarter-to-quarter, it's going to be a bit different. There's going to be a lowering, but on the whole, we expect this to be like this, in this range. I am stressing this in particular because I am going to have all those quarterly calls, I want you to keep this in mind as the overall direction.</p><p>Now here's a few words about our spending. As we have said today, our spending on IT has been growing considerably, R&amp;D. That spending comprises pretty much mostly the spending on people. You know that inflation in wages, on engineers and data scientists and AI engineers is pretty high. The cost of these people is internationalized. It's international. And the difference between the is there but it is still very strongly correlated, the cost of these people between various countries. And unfortunately, the market for the properly qualified HR resources in the market is not deep enough. And the growth of the business volume, the growth of the IT as our operating foundation that is leading inevitably to the more expensive talent and now fighting for talent.</p><p>Also we are migrating from legacy systems to new systems. That means that you have to run 2 things in parallel. And this is essentially a double cost. We need to appreciate that. And again, very importantly, you will remember that last year, we decided -- we made the decision that we had not envisaged in December 2017, that we need to change the accounting treatment of our software development. We transitioned into OpEx from CapEx about RUB 20 billion worth of spending, that was annual spending. Essentially, those are the money we spent on our coders that are involved in that.</p><p>Those coders used to be part of the Sberbank-Technologies (sic) [Sberbank-Technology], a subsidiary that we brought on board. And starting from the first of July, they are reflected as part of our HR spending as OpEx. In current figures, because IT developers are on a different figure, that's about 2 percentage points of our cost-to-income ratio. That's quite a bit. As of today, that's actually more than RUB 20 billion, that's actually above RUB 25 billion. That was a -- that was done on purpose so we can save on amortization and depreciation subsequently. Also we wanted to raise the accountability of the business managers. That reflected on the P&amp;L, internal P&amp;L. We now have a hard P&amp;L between the business logs. And in this sense, it's very important to note that element as we look at the spending. So comparing these expenses with 2017 is not entirely correct because part of that expense in 2017 was in CapEx.</p><p>That said, we are trying to bring down our spending on all the others expenses, all the other operating expenses. And here, we questioned ourselves, how did we calculate that RUB 1 billion additional gain from AI? There's no single area of activity that would really bring you that RUB 1 billion. These are tens and hundreds of initiatives and I can only tell you about several of them. All of those initiatives are essentially -- I mean what AI is, it is essentially a redesign of the process in a way that the machine can rationalize a process to make it quicker, cheaper and more effective and efficient.</p><p>To give you an example, over the 3 years, just the accounting office that is structurally subordinated to me as part of the finance department, they are going to have a headcount decrease by 25%. And before that, there was a 20x decrease starting from 2008. So there's always an opportunity to do something better than you had been doing before. Is that important? Yes, it is. The same goes for the shrinkage of the middle and back office function, functions that are being replaced with robots. There's about 40% of decrease in headcount on paper. On paper, there's a shrinkage of 30% to 40%. We're going to be spending less on paper.</p><p>I can also say that we have been using models to improve much better, much higher, the expected duration of our loan portfolio. That calculated a much better exposure at risk. And because we calculated better exposure at risk and since we have this PD, and this is not a single point, but a curve that is growing as the term matures, we have an improvement on 2 parameters that directly affect the provisions. And that model was validated and that is reflected in our report, financial report already. You can look at the financial report that we publish. You can always find that figure in there, just how much the model approach saved us, and that only was enabled by the analysis of a huge data set.</p><p>I gave you an example of how we cut the cost, about how we diminish -- decrease the provisions. All of those methods have been validated by our auditors and Central Bank so we are correct in doing that. And that also helps us to earn because the application of models, as Anatoly was telling you, models are helping us to be much quicker, more precise and more on target in positioning our products. We can quote better, we can get better pricing on loans and deposits. This is largely done by the machine.</p><p>Now I can say that there is no manual labor in ALM, and it has been for a while. I use this word manual. Manual gearbox was replaced. Now a part of the margin is ALM, and here, we use modeling. This is modeling for -- that uses hundreds of models that describe various classes of our assets and liabilities. This is a dynamic modeling that we're using and it delivers the best option in terms of the pricing. So dynamic balance, something that has been presented, was presented last year, is being rolled out more actively and currently, part of our algorithms, their work based on AI, and it gives us tips in terms of where we need to make a decision to amend our pricing.</p><p>As you can imagine, the banking product range is huge, the number of interest rates that have to change every day. These are thousands of interest rates for this range of products. And machine is doing that, working with such huge swathes of data, much better than a person. It finds inefficiencies, removes them and gives the recommendations on the best approach.</p><p>This year, we launched the floating rates, something that has been already mentioned. We're gradually starting to rebuild our internal algorithms that can work with the floating ruble rate. And it also gives some additional positive influence on our fee and commission income. There are many, many positive examples like that. And if we put them all together, there are -- there is a huge number of initiatives from all blocks. But I want you to understand, that means better processes, better processes to earn more money, to save money and to cut costs on provisions.</p><p>And you can see it here. So you can see that the ecosystem is currently on the investment phase. We are building it. And our key KPIs here are the commercial success metrics, commercial efficiency metrics. These are the metrics that was set by Lev that are going -- metrics that are going to be discussed in larger details during our calls. We would love to hear your feedback. You can use our Investor Relations service for that. You could say what is a priority for you? What is more interesting to you? We do not promise that we would cater for all of your needs and answer all of your questions. We know that we won't be able to do that instantly. But we are committed to making sure that we gradually increase the information that we disclose. And we know that every quarter, we have some additional disclosures in information.</p><p>And currently, one of the most important priorities for disclosing information is the gradual addition of the information about our ecosystem. And as for the headcount, headcount without IT and experts is diminishing, its share is diminishing, as you can see.</p><p>There was a question about our network. I can say that our [14,500] branches have a very low cost-to-income ratio. This regional sales network, it's not only these traditional branches. But there is a structure of sales for the entire network. But IT, back office, middle office, risk, finance and HR management and product development are not there because this is Sberbank stand-alone. And here, we see the flattish picture. That's around 2 percentage point from that is the expenses to develop IT products that are reflected in OpEx, not CapEx. If it was on CapEx, it would be 30.</p><p>And then Sberbank Group, there is a slight increase of cost-to-income ratio. It is related, first of all, to the technology transformation and the development of our ecosystem. In terms of the technology transformation, I'm sorry to reiterate that again, but it's very important to make sure that you understand my message. We are moving to the stage of migration from old system to a new system. There will be a radical change of the landscape. So the old systems, legacy systems are still going to work but the new systems are working too. So there are service and cloud but we have to maintain and support both systems. And I know no bank in the world that would work in 9 time zones. And basically closing as banking day every day and doing that with such a great amount -- number of customers. No product, no service -- in no product and in no service, our share is equivalent of the share of the 5 largest American banks in their market. It's always higher. And if you look at mobile bank indicators as well, here were figures with [65 million] to [22.5 million] so it's DAU and MAU and 40% is the ratio. That's huge, that's huge. And that is -- usually, you can see that in high-tech companies, leading high-tech companies because for that, you need a lot of redundant resources and great investments in IT and the very important and huge infrastructure.</p><p>So these expenses, we think, are going to be temporary. And this helps to ensure the reliability of the systems. And reliability is -- it's not even #1 priority. It's like 0 priority, it's like the foundation of our agenda. And this reliability needs some additional expenses, which leads to greater cost-to-income.</p><p>Now capital adequacy, we closed the deal with DenizBank, improved the CAR. We confirm our intentions, starting from the next year, to go to the dividend payout of 50% from the dividend payout for 2019. As for the dividend for the period of this strategy, trying to answer your question that you might have, question will be asked when we prepare -- answered when we prepare our strategy for the next 3 years. And the dividend policy for the next 3 years would be an integral part for our next 3-year strategy. The strategy is going to be presented in November or December next year. Before that, I would not like to comment on that, but it is quite obvious that we do not forecast this level to go lower to the level of 50%.</p><p>For the model, that's enough. And Tier 1 capital, we're going to have around 14% by the end of the year. That's realistic, given all of the suggestions and ideas and innovations that are now actively debated in terms of the changing of the risk weights. This is our best representation as of today. What factors affect this figure? This is our sensitivity. Devaluation of ruble by 10% gives a great effect of 29 basis points and the change of the curve by 100 bps, that's 21 basis points and the growth of RWA by RUB 0.5 trillion, it's another 20 basis points, so that you understand. That means that we have a great safety margin in terms of complying with all the requirements by the Central Bank, including contracyclical buffer. And that's the figures by the end of the year -- relevant for the end of the next year.</p><p>And these are -- this is a very important component that translates into the reliability of our capital, and that means that we have a good capital structure. I would like to remind you that in the world, among the largest banks, there are no banks with a leverage of more than 11%. Sberbank is the only bank with such a leverage figure.</p><p>Our guidance, given all that has been said, there is a small increase in terms of cost-to-income ratios, a small deterioration. Flat net interest margin. Fee and commission growth, 10% for year, cost of risk, 100 and 110 basis points, and (inaudible) which was quite conservative, which is quite conservative. And the most important thing, return on equity, 20% as promised. And CAR, that's the derivative from it.</p><p>Well, colleagues, I'd like to remind you that we have met for quite -- for many times. And I saw that for us, the most important indicator of our success is the following: at any point in time, we deliver superior economic value-added, which is ROE minus cost of capital. We deliver it to our investors and shareholders. We do expect that next year, including thanks to your work and to your efforts and thanks to the Russian market that has more than 1 million brokerage accounts opened on the Sberbank, the cost of capital would be reviewed with the removal of the risk -- premium risk rates. And it will even more -- increase the economic added value even more.</p><p>And we deliver -- we have been delivering this economic value for years now and I'm sure you will be content. This return on equity indicator for me, I think is the most important indicator. It's on the top of the pyramid. But another important thing is to make sure that we ensure the good yields on the capital, the superior economic value added. We want to do that today, tomorrow and then long term.</p><p>We cannot promise you that we have this 20% all the time. If the rates go down to near to 0, then the interest rate environment will dwindle and that will be it. It will go down. But the economic added value superior compared to all of our peers is our criteria and it will remain. That's for sure. Thank you very much, and now I'd like to show you the last slide. Churchill said that there is no sense to say that we do everything we can. You should do everything you need to do, that is necessary to be done. So we take into account all of the changes of nature, weather, change in the interest rate environment and other factors, but the most important factor that we count on is us and our work. Thank you very much and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. We're starting with our Q&amp;A. Have many hands, okay, starting the Q&amp;A session. Gabor, please?</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY: What a presentation. First one is on margins and growth. You talked about possibly high single-digit corporate loan growth, even double-digit retail loan growth, that would leave us somewhere around the 10-ish percent overall loan growth. And if I put this together with a flattish or very slight drop in the margins which we saw, that would leave me somewhere around the high single-digit NII growth. Is this a reasonable assumption on your guidance?</p><p>And the other question is, I mean the overall guidance, I think is pretty much in line with consensus expectations. And consensus is a bit below the RUB 1 trillion profit you initially targeted for 2020. Can you comment on how you think about that target at this stage?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Thank you for your question. We have never targeted some specific net interest income. We always target the parameters. But if you combine all these parameters together, it gives us a double-digit EPS growth. That's for sure. And I think that's enough to answer your question if you look at your entire model. As for the second part of your question, we have never targeted specifically. Even when we present the strategy in London, we have never said that it is going to be this figure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Could you please tell, RUB 1 trillion and RUB 10 billion or RUB 999 billion, is this somewhere in the other target?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] If you look at the -- at 1% of deviation, that's RUB 10 billion. On the horizon of 3 years, especially these 3 years that we're very active, there were ups and downs in dollars. Everyone was expecting it to soar, they went down when the euro rates went even further down, although they were expected it to grow. When the landscape of regulation changed so much and continuing to change, when the behavior of the customers are changing so quickly. Is it real to -- on the perspective on 3 years to move in this -- within this margin of 2%, 3%? But we think that we will be near that. Our target was ROE, more than 20% ROE. That was our target, major critical target.</p><p>If you look at another thing, the dividend payout that we have paid throughout these 3 years, given the dividends that we'll pay this year, I mean for this year, this is going to be much more than we had in -- than you had in your model and that we have even in our models. That's the cash that the bank pays out. Now I would not want to -- I mean you worked greatly and you did a lot of good job. This is why we give you a lot of figures and we give you some wiggle room, but it should not be very, very large wiggle room. Next question? I hope I answered your question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sberbank CIB. You mentioned now increasing floating-rate loans within your portfolio. I'd be interested to hear if you can tell us what kind of share of the corporate book are now floating rate loans? And do you have concerns that this is going to start having a kind of more negative impact on your loan yields and margins kind of given the kind of falling rate environment? And a kind of slight follow-up. In terms of the falling rate environment, you're basically still giving the view that this is the kind of net positive for you on an NII basis. Do you not think that at some stage next year, once a lot of the deposit and funding cost repricing has kind of come through, that there's going to be a kind of tipping point if rates keep falling, that your loan yields are going to start really adding more downward pressure to your margins?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Thank you for your question. I think currently, it's around 20%, the closing rate, I mean. If you look at the effect, it gives us the possibility to respond quicker. It will help to automatically change the interest rate. It will help to drive down the interest rate-related risk. And this is a more convenient tool for a customer and for us, too, in terms of managing this risk. And the possibility to significantly grow the loan portfolio in those segments that we consider priority segments for us in the corporate lending.</p><p>We have factored in all the effects, answering the -- your second part of the question. All the effects of the repricing in our model, we have factored them in. And this is why we're giving this guidance, not as a point, but we give a range in terms of the interest rate that I showed 5 10, 5 30.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Next question please. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] My question is about macro, those macro forecasts for GDP growth. What scenario, factors in the implementation of the national projects, what will be the effect of the implementation of national projects next year? And what is the growth of the corporate lending that you expect from the market? Do you expect to grow higher than the market in your models and expectations? So do you plan to participate in these projects?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Yes, I'm going to ask Alex to start and then pick up.</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Yes, indeed, I made -- I omitted, on purpose, mentioning national projects. Well, they have a short-term effect and a long-term effect. And the long-term effects, yes, they do increase the demand. They allow you to hire more people and to utilize more capacity that's already utilized -- underutilized. So next year, growth is going to accelerate to 1.7%. That's a short-term as we factor in. Not a lot is part of national projects here because those experience shows government spending is not a large multiple in stimulating the GDP. But over the long term, they aim to increase the potential for growth. Basically, they invest into the physical and the human capital. And that's the reason why we increased our long-term growth projection from 2% to 2.5%. That, again, is not a lot. We think that national projects will gently push the long-term growth, but not to a very great degree. Also, we need to be aware that the national projects replace and the spending that used to be on the Olympic games and then the football championship. So this is not a great net growth of spending, and this is offset by higher taxes, actually, that accompanied all those projects and that really decreases the effect of international projects. So on balance, it's not a great effect.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Yes. Colleagues, Anastasia is showing the headlines. And I think I made a point of speaking in Russian. It was a -- I made a point in using Russian, but because the Russian journalists are listening to us. They're also present here. I did not mention any figure for net profit next year. Please quote me right. If it is a quote, this is a Bloomberg. Yes. Ana, thank you. We are targeting the figure of 20% ROE. We are targeting the figure of double-digit EPS. We are targeting the figures we included in our guidance, but we never, not on a single conference call, not in a single meeting, we never specifically targeted a net profit figure because that is practically pointless. And over the long term, it is meaningless. What is important for us and the reason why I'm going back, back and back to -- there's relative measures, because it is the relative measures tell you the trends. It is the relative measures tell you what to expect not only tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow because they are much longer playing. And in this sense, I think, that for your models, for analysts, for investors, it is the parameters that we determine, and I gave you several additional parameters, but I only cited for the first time, I give you the breakdown of cost-to-income by component. And I gave you the -- around the detailed structure of our spending, what we had not done before. Since these parameters in their dynamics that define the financial stability of the company, the resilience of the company and the resilience of the financial performance over the mid and long term. So colleagues, please be correct. That is my big request to journalists. Thank you.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Yes, I've got a technical announcement to make that we just went offline and the webcast stopped. So we can continue this discussion off the record, and we can simply record it and put it on the website. So I think we can just continue. Okay. Are we recording now, colleagues? Yes. Okay, then we are continuing. Yes, all of the material information got disclosed already.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Yes, I would like to get some clarification on the spending, the higher cost-to-income ratio, do you expect it in light of the high R&amp;D and ecosystem. I'm a little confused with that comment versus the comment by Mr. Khasis that said that all the spending on ecosystem are actually not recognized as cost but as investments in equities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] We consolidate the company as if we are a controlling shareholder or if we use our equity stake. Anyway, the spending of the company does become our spending.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] But on all the joint ventures, you are a noncontrolling shareholder.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Interpreted] Yes, but there's a whole raft of companies where we are the controlling shareholder, and there, there is spending. Also, R&amp;D and ecosystem are the 2 components that Mr. Khasis mentioned, and I said that it's IT transformation, transition from the legacy to the new systems and the further increase of the system's reliability and that's not R&amp;D. That's the current business they run, but also, one, you have the number of transactions, there's 700,000 transactions, 700,000 applications, over 700,000 received in 2 days. That many applications had not been encountered by any big bank. I beg your pardon. This is a major challenge, and we must be prepared that this is an exponential growth. And next year, where I supposed to see this, we should be ready for this figure to grow several times. That means that requires us not only to develop our main capabilities, but also the backup capabilities. And the same goes for cybersecurity, the same goes for -- I mean for us, cybersecurity, the security of money and information of our customers and about our customers is security of settlements, that is part of our technological safety that is a priority #1. And this is the main investment in terms of IT spending.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Yes, one more clarification is there that I seek. When you come into the increase in cost-to-income ratio, you said that it is a temporary increase. Without running ahead into the next year's strategy, can we look at this nature a bit beyond the short-term increase? Do you think you're going to stay within inflation or go below inflation or above inflation on CIR dynamic?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] You can't migrate the systems within 1 year. As David said, it's going to take several years. And this is a natural process as for any organization of our scale, of our size, especially when we speak about the ecosystem, when we say that Sberbank is more than a bank. So I think, yes, we could be, and we'll just speak about that, but it is going to take a bit longer than 1 year. How much -- how long exactly we're going to be able to come back to this in about a year when we present a new strategy.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay. Yes. More questions? No more questions? I doubt that. We don't have any on the Internet? Well, if I'm in the no Internet and no questions, that's going to be quite boring.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Well, thank you very much for a detailed discussion, but I would like to go back to the cost-to-income ratio. First off, in terms of income, we got a very detailed explanation of what's going on, but the margin within fees and commissions income. What about the other income? Can we expect perhaps a quicker growth in there and perhaps not just single digit, perhaps a question with respect to this, on growth of income. If we have a growth and not a fall in other income, does that -- can we expect that the growth of spending is going to be at least the same as this year, although this year we were negatively affected by the transfer from CapEx to OpEx on IT and personnel?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Well, in the first half of the day, we were addressed by Natalya Alymova, and she gave, I think a very important and strong message. I hope all of you heard it. I came from the retail business block, says she. We did a conveyor belt in the retail business block. We need to do the same in wealth -- in insurance, in wealth management, in the pensions business. I have to remind you that the share of noncash payments was about 5%. But just to be 5 plus or minus years ago, now does cashless. That is the technologies that Sberbank developed. We did it at scale, Sberbank Online, the acquiring business, the massive introduction of NFC through a lot of ATM machines, and that gave the new quality and new convenience. We think that in a whole number of industries, wealth, primarily, insurance, pensions, et cetera, there's a whole -- there's a huge potential for growth, but that potential cannot be latent, cannot be tapped into, unless we propose a more convenient and more -- higher and highly efficient tool for customers to use and for banks to operate -- or the bank to operate, in terms of the process and in terms of interaction with the customer, and that also requires investment. We are saying that we are building an ecosystem. But an ecosystem, when we discuss products here, that's just the top of the iceberg. And that's just like the toys. I sometimes give this example. You can hang up certain toys on the fir tree, but then you need a fir tree. So these systemic elements, some of them Lev mentioned. David mentioned another part, the cloud, cybersecurity, API, the ID, the data mark, there's a whole string of things, all those technological elements are sometimes -- we built up some of them. And sometimes, we just need to roll them out, cascade them. Sometimes they are being tested and increased in terms of resilience. But this is the foundation that will be allowing us to extract the value, the great value that we see in our investments. And in this sense, it's just meaningless, it's pointless to calculate debt over EBITDA at the investment phase. It's just meaningless. Let's have enough patience to see the end of the investment phase, and we'll see what happens. That's just what we saw in the retail business. It bears reminding that Sberbank's retail business 15 years ago, it was pretty nonexistent. I mean its market share was considerably less, even in lending. I mean in deposits, was a big share, but in lending, that was very little. If you look at the share, if you look at the history of the growth, that is the product of the technological development. 700,000 applications in 2 days, it's unreal to make a decision on all of them. We need to make -- to do the same thing on all the other products, starting with wealth. Of course, we're going to get additional income. Of course, over 1 million of brokerage accounts, we're going to get additional income from that. Of course, trade finance is going to get small -- it all lines up. Obviously, the products Anatoly Popov introduced, those are all the bricks in the wall. If you want to set up a business, you can just come and use all those LEGO bricks to build a business, marketing, HR, the back office, tax. You put all that together and your business idea is going to be turned into cash from an idea. But all that takes a detailed development. So in parallel to the growth of income, there's going to be a growth of spending base, yet we're going to be trying to keep that inside the cost-to-income frame that is going to be marginally higher than we showed -- that we're going to show for the current year.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Thank you. And perhaps a question in the last row, then all -- perhaps we should close up. We're going to -- we are being squeezed for time by the next event, then we can continue off the record.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Interpreted] Yes. Just more clarification on that corporate lending, that question somehow hung up because of Bloomberg. How do you intend to grow above the market in corporate lending? And what, in your view, is going to be the factor, the driver for the market? Good quality demand -- [I meant] the lower rates? Or something else in light of tightening in the retail?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Well, we see a rather high positive exposure of demand amid lower rates. That's mortgages and retail and corporates. That sensitivity is there. Also we made a bet, and we have been consistently developing this since last year on the small and medium businesses, but I'm pretty happy with how this business has been developing. And we are looking forward to see this growth in SMEs accelerate.</p><p>As for the major businesses, the large and largest businesses, we also see the demand here, but this is mostly related to lower rates. But -- and our new products, especially floating rate products, the 7-minute loans that we have been actively developing and other similar products that make the process of borrowing, the process of relating to the bank -- with a bank is made much more convenient, and transactional cost is made much lower on the part of the customer. All of that gives us grounds to assume that the volume of our efforts is going to be transferred into quality, or perhaps the quality of our products is going to be reflected in the number of loans disbursed and the growth of the loan portfolio.</p><p>This year, we made a conscious effort, and Alexander Vedyakhin mentioned that, we looked and we made a pretty hard analysis of our portfolio to make the margin steady, the margin on certain customers, we wanted to keep it in line with the risk that we assume in certain cases. In some cases, the loan portfolio was seen shrink, but we never really chased the market share on major customers. And we are not prepared to buy that market share.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay. Thank you, Olga. Thank you, Alexander.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLOVTSOV, HEAD OF INVESTMENT RESEARCH, URALSIB ASSET MANAGEMENT: [Interpreted] I would like to confirm the sensitivity of the margin to the change in rates, the share of the loans that you give out with the floating rate. Could you disclose what part of those loans is tied to Russian rates and which is LIBOR? It's only in Russian rates that those floating loans are given out? Is that share growing?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Yes. So the sensitivity to the policy rate is going to be higher. The sensitivity to the policy rate is going to be, yes, increasing. We're going to be doing this in a managed mode, but it will be growing. We think that the introduction of floating rates is the right thing for the market. We think this is the development in the right way in corporate lending. And we think that this should be done on the descending curve of the rates. It is going to be much more comfortable to a transition to the new rules for the customers and the banks alike.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Yes, Elena, you had a question? Okay. We are done then. And yes, we're done after Elena.</p><p>ELENA TSAREVA: [Interpreted] My question is about the capital management. You are targeting 14% on Tier 1 ratio. That's above what you had, 12.5% in the strategy. Given the level and the strategy, you had that at 15%. It's not about the dividends. I mean that's a sensitive question. But this is a comfortable buffer in light of the risks, the new regulation, and there's a point that Dzhangir made, transition to Basel 3.5, the expectation is of a positive effect in 2020?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Well, we factored in all the effects that we could possibly account for, positive and negative, because there are all kinds of innovations, all kinds of innovations are being muted. And we factored in all the requirements of capital and cushions. And all of that was reflected in the slide that I showed. The 14% is a level. That is the minimum satisfaction of all the requirements for the bank of our size in light of the possibility of introduction to countercyclical buffer that has not been introduced yet. But if it is introduced, we will still be in line with that guidance. So the further change of the core equity Tier 1 adequacy, I would postpone that discussion until the end of the next year. But the level of 14%, we see that a more or less safe level. I think that would be resilient to any surprise in the market with flying colors.</p><p>ANASTASIA E. BELYANINA: [Interpreted] Okay. Thank you very much. I think we are at the end. Perhaps Alexander is going to say the words to sum up, and then I'm going to make a small announcement, or shall I make it right now?</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] On your seats, you had the programs and there was a feedback form inside. Please fill that in and hand it over to myself or the colleagues that are helping us. You're going to see them near the cloakroom. Yes, colleagues and -- I would like to introduce to you not Alexander, but Alexandra, that is a much more pleasant introduction to make. There's Alexandra Buriko. Please, very warm welcome to her. From the 1st of July next year, she's going to lead the finance department of Sberbank. She's going to step into my shoes. I'm going to hang around. I'm always there. I'm always nearby, and I will be. I'm really looking forward to staying as one big whole and the same productive dialogue that we have had throughout these years. And I hope that you're going to get the same relationship of trust, and by the way trust is a key word here with Alexandra. I'm grateful to you for all the trust that you displayed to me over the past 12 years. Thank you very much. We will certainly hear each other until the 12th of -- 1st of July, and we're going to meet some of you. And after that, we're going to stay good friends and colleagues in the market. So thank you. Alexandra Buriko, please, very warm welcome.</p><p>ALEXANDRA BURIKO, SENIOR VP &amp; HEAD OF THE FINANCE UNIT, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: [Interpreted] Alexander, thank you very much. Colleagues, I have nothing more to add, really. I do hope that we would work closely together. And I'll try to be in line with the benchmark that was set by Alexander that he was setting now for 12 years. So we're going to work together. Thank you, Alexander. I do hope that you would not feel any difference between Alexander and Alexandra. A very seamless transition.</p><p>ALEXANDER VLADIMIROVICH MOROZOV: [Interpreted] Anyway, thank you, dear colleagues. Have a nice rest of the day, and please fill out the feedback form. It would help us to change and to improve our event. In terms of the form, in terms of the essence of the presentation, in terms of the format, in terms of some logistical details, I'd like to thank the team of Anastasia Belyanina. I'd like to thank you for your feedback because our IR service was awarded the first prize on the Russian markets. And I know that these ladies and gentlemen are working with you 24/7, and I'd like to take this opportunity and say thank you to IR team headed by Anastasia. And let's have a round of applause for their work. I do hope that you are satisfied with that. Thank you very much. I hope that it was a great event for you, an instructive event for you.

KHASIS, FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; COO, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Good morning. Good morning, dear ladies and gentlemen. Maxim, thanks a bunch. Maxim generally does the better part of the job, the larger part. Essentially, his part of the presentation can be considered the presentation in our technologies and the ecosystem, so I've only got a few bits left, just to give you the few nuances that she -- he fell short of time for.</p><p>Now why did we decide to build our ecosystem? It's an obvious answer, isn't it? Firstly, it's a global trend. And if we are a technological company, all the big tech companies build any case system around them. Russia is a window of opportunities. Why? Because global players have either not entered the Russian market or they did enter the Russian market, but they are still extremely insignificant in the overall lay of the land. Especially in Russia, there's only 3 companies that have been trying to build an ecosystem around them, 2 of them are tech companies that were native in tech, that is Yandex and Mail, and it is Sberbankthat is essentially a tech company.</p><p>In our opinion, we are ideally positioned to use all our capabilities for building an ecosystem. Why? We've got million of clients, individuals and companies. We've got a vast access to all kinds of data. We have got the ability to offer our clients any service at all, and we do not have to be the providers of those services. When Herman Oskarovich or Maxim spoke about the need to meet the end need of a client, our role is not in providing the actual service. Our role is to become the orchestrator on the relevant ecosystem and to connect the client, be it an individual or a corporate, with the best in quality or price provider of this service. And at the central of this whole thing, when we unite the technology, clients and data and the service providers, the greatest value arises at the focal point of all that, perhaps this is even magic and not value because bringing we know everything about the client and when we can anticipate the needs of the client, that creates this inimitable client experience that in our opinion no one of our competition can reproduce.</p><p>We are focused on the end results of our clients, individuals and corporates alike. We'll look at the end goals, at the end needs and not the ways to achieve that. Maxim spoke of the real estate example, people needing the actual property and not the mortgage. These examples are numerous to cite. We'll look at the industries, at the sizing of those various industries. We'll look at the potential in all those industries, some nonexistent yet, some already in observation. We have already set out on this journey. We already have several companies that have this considerable potential. Some of those are technical, technical companies. Some are strategic. But they all create this unique client experience for our clients and unassailable competitive positions for us.</p><p>We chose 6 very simple criteria that we base our strategic investment decisions on. Here is a very simple criteria, you'll see them on the screen. And we guide ourselves with these criteria when we decide. We think that our strategic investments over the horizon of 5 years, at least in 4 industries, about a half (inaudible) of those on which we're going to focus, we'll have to help us create the leading players in the relevant segments. The material potential it plays in real estate, DomClick.</p><p>The next business that we would like to give you, in our opinion, is the most promising business that we entered as recently as yesterday and with the announcement of the final signing</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>outstanding industry in the United States and China. The leading commerce player is materially more valuable than the most expensive</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>bank. In the Russia, the conditions are ideal to build a strong company in electronic commerce. At this time, the share of e-commerce in the overall trade turnover in Russia is only about 4%. Whereas in China, that share exceeds 20%. But the speed of change that we have seen in Russia will allow electronic commerce to grow materially quicker than in many other markets. And our goal is to use the next 3, 4 years and our joint venture with Yandex to achieve the GMV of around 500 -- RUB 5 billion. That is a growth of more than 3x. And we are convinced that together with Yandex and several other companies of the partnership with which we are currently talking with those companies, we will be able to deliver on this goal.</p><p>The next project that we're also doing with Yandex is Yandex Money. We do not talk very much about Yandex Money, and many people do not know what that is. But you will have heard of what PayPal is. I think 100% of the people have heard that. That is a very famous company. Yandex Money is both PayPal and Stripe, that's the leading electronic board and a completely unique technology of making payments online that makes entrance into electronic commerce for companies just as easy as it is done by the leading company in the area called Stripe. Maxim told you that we are striving to serve our clients in the future without asking them to carry any physical items with them, credit cards or smartphones. Several months ago -- actually it was more recently than that, we invested in a company called, VisionLabs and that's a top 3 international company in face recognition. On the whole, we think that computer vision will allow us to recognize both text and do a lot of other things to create a completely unique client experience for our clients. I'm going to mention client experience many times in my presentation today because he who wins in user experience and client experience will create the competitive edge.</p><p>The next area where we're going to enter is cybersecurity. At Sberbank, I'm going to mention this in detail later, is maniacally focused on protecting its sounds systems, the systems of its clients from cyber threats. We are a recognized leader in Russia in cybersecurity. As part of the cyber digital economy program that involves the leading Russian companies, tech companies among others, Yandex.Mail, those companies voted us hands-down the national leader in cybersecurity.</p><p>This year, [Basel], a company that we created in cybersecurity will have completed its first 12 months in operation. In this year, it has strengthened quite considerably. Its revenue is relatively small in absolute numbers, only about</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>contracts. 90% of that money is external clients, and we are very glad that international companies are among those clients. Because Basel was accredited by SWIFT. It did sign the agreement with the Interpol, and we are in active contacts with many leading international companies active in cybersecurity.</p><p>I have to say a little more than a couple of words on another industry that is called digital medicine, e-health. What would be banks having in common with e-health? In actual fact, there's a lot. The first thing in common is our clients. They are all people that have to be healthy. They have to live longer because the longer they live, the more money we earn off them. Secondly is the data, and I can't pronounce this enough, data and the ability to learn from data is what sets one companies apart from other companies. Several years ago, Mr. Gref put this very important thesis, in my opinion. He said that the 21st century turns data into the new oil. Today, we see that our algorithms, the algorithms we use in banking, the solutions in artificial intelligence allow for completely different approaches to diagnosis to predictive health. When we answer e-health, it does not mean that we intend to hire doctors, that we intend to build hospitals. We want to be an orchestrator of this ecosystem. We wanted to connect the clients with doctors, doctors with health care facilities. And all of those above with pharmaceutical companies, there are huge synergies to be exploited between e-health and our main lines of business, both corporate and retail.</p><p>The wealth management has a lot of potential of integrating with e-health services. Less than a year ago, we entered this industry by buying the most promising company in the market, the leader in the e-health market in Russia, DocDoc. In less than 12 months this company, together with us has grown twice. And this year, the company has served over 500,000 clients. Its database spans tens of thousands of doctors, clinics. On the 1st of January, this company is opening a completely new blue ocean of business called telemedicine. That law kicks in, comes into force, from the 1st of January, and we think that this company has a huge potential.</p><p>Very briefly, let me tell you about other companies that we invested in and we find interest in. Avatar, the electronic cash register. Two main lines of business in Avatar. First this is the cutting edge smart terminals for small businesses. And the second, they are a fiscal data operator. Maxim mentioned the importance of knowing not just where the client shopped and how much he has spent. It's very important to know the composition of the actual receipt. And Avatar, that has only been recently in the fiscal data market with 26% of the market, that operator of the fiscal data is our window into this market. And it gives us a completely different quality of analysis of client needs. And this area has a lot of promise to its future.</p><p>Another company you may have heard little about is SberbankAST. And this is national leader in electronic auctioning. Every year, SberbankAST conducts hundreds of thousands of procurement procedures. And this year $32 billion were transacted in electronic auctions and tenders handled on this platform. Our mobile virtual operator and a platform to build end-to-end in IoT is SberbankTelecom. It allows us to save -- to have saved already RUB 1 billion by replacing the very expensive SMS messages with push notifications. And this year, we are beginning to deploy these services in a fully fledged format for the benefit of end clients that are going to be providing these services of mobile communications on a completely different level, having integrated them with the financial services.</p><p>Before we pass over to the platform proper and the technologies, I have to say a few words about another company of ours, SberbankTechnologies, SberTech. The figures are self-explanatory. Just think about it, in 10 years, we have been able to augment about 10x the share of IT development performed inside the SberbankGroup. This creates completely new opportunities because we've got the internal capabilities. We are less and less dependent on external vendors. And we can build our process, the process of developing software inside our group and do it quicker that allows us to create a completely different time-to-market frame compared to many other banks that operate in conventional modalities.</p><p>A small bridge to make from these things to our internal banking platforms. Very importantly, we create our IT platform of tomorrow that will integrate with our ecosystem. By API, we will be able to interact, not just with the ecosystem of ours, but with external ecosystems as well. Another very important element is the global profile that we are building for the residents of our ecosystem. This is Sber ID. Sber ID will be used by our clients to get access to all of our marketplaces. But besides that, we're going to be offering this to external ecosystems for a person that got himself registered with us to gain access to companies that will render their services to this client even they are -- even though those client companies are external to our ecosystem.</p><p>A couple of words on our platform. We have built this platform with the cutting edge things in technology. Everything that you have heard of about in-memory computing, about real-time decision-making, about dynamic pricing with prices defined at the point of contact for service provision, where the price dependent not on the things that the client did with us, but on the client behavior in social networks, on the client behavior in shopping, shopping history. And very importantly, this platform is going to be flexible, and it will allow for integration with both our internal and external capabilities. And this platform will allow us pretty similar time-to-market figures measured in hours that are, these days, featured by the leading tech companies.</p><p>We have significantly advanced towards finishing our projects in platform implementation. Next year, we intend to complete all the processes related to the coding of all the things on our platform. All the hardware is going to be in place. In 2019, the data and testing will be complete. And in 2020, the end of our 3 year strategy, we intend to see our platform kick into full capability including the connections with our ecosystem. This year, we were able to accomplish a very complicated project related to the transition of a material part of our IT developments to agile management principles. When our tech and business units operate together, we decided that not only we have to work together with Maxim as an agile team, as an agile pair, we thought that all our employees have to be agile, both if they develop projects, if they develop products for our clients and if they kill them. And that makes for a completely different quality of operation and that changes dramatically the timeframe for new product delivery and development. That will make sure that new products are taken to the market in the shortest time possible.</p><p>The overwhelming number of our developments are going to transition to DevOps. And we take particular pride in the fact that Sberbank's mobile application only came fourth, WhatsApp, (inaudible) Instagram in the number of downloads. We think this is a unique case when a banking application comes forth in downloads in the nation. Mr. Gref said that it has been 10 years since he assumed the helm of Sberbankand the team has launched all those transformations. We have traveled a fantastical path in those 10 years.</p><p>I'm going to switch on the next 3 years to implement our strategy. Until the strategy is implemented, we're going to shrink the number of people employed in accomplishing our operations by the number of 10 -- by a factor 10. Legacy systems are going to shrink by a factor of 1,000. And that will allow us over the horizon of 2020, maybe 2021, to make complete departure from the legacy systems so we can bring down the cost of owning of our IT infrastructure and increase dramatically the efficiency of our IT system in terms of speed and cost. Reliability is an area of other focus for us. We have achieved very big successes here. We brought down dramatically the downtime when our clients cannot use our systems. 99.99% is a very high level of reliability indeed. We increased 20x the volume of transactions that we perform. And the reliability of our IT systems is an absolute priority for our focus.</p><p>Now two words about cybersecurity. What it means for the bank. We think that we're not doing enough to protect our customers properly. We are the best, yes, but this is a focus for our attention. This is on top of the agenda all the time because the cyber threats are increasing. We are the awarded leader. Recently, we have received a award from MasterCard as the best company delivering cybersecurity. And yesterday, the U.K. Institute of Standardization gave us a certificate testifying that our security system is in line with the world's best practices.</p><p>We have created the entire ecosystem of innovations that includes, not only our internal business units that work within our functional areas, but the venture fund as well. And this venture fund not only invests in start-ups to get a good return on investments, but it also creates synergies with our bank. This is one of the tasks of this fund. And making sure that we have access to the cutting edge technologies, we have created 8 labs in the areas that you can see in the middle of the slide that are focused on resolving applicable application-related tasks, on making new technologies usable for the business. The accelerator that we are creating, internal and external ones, is going also to promote the use of creative ideas of our employees and external ideas alike to create new products and technologies.</p><p>Just one example. Our robotics lab. I'm not going to cover everything that it does. But this year, we started to test the cash delivery with drones. It's only the first step ahead, and our drone can deliver 3 kilograms of cash and go at the speed of 180 kilometers per hour at a distance of 15 or 20 kilometers. We -- it's actually -- it delivers real cash, real money. And we're doing practical testing right now. In the cash centers, we have many bladers or robots that are working instead of people increasing the productivity and speed by a factor of 3. At the same time, the precision of the processing is much higher. This is just one of the examples when the applicable down-to-earth technologies are used for our business and for our customers, but the major breakthrough we expect from the artificial intelligence.</p><p>The real maniac of AI is the Head of Risks Block, Aleksandr Vedyakhin. He's a real champion of AI. And I would like to give him the floor, the Senior Vice President of Sberbank, Head of Risks Block. He is going to cover our operations and risks and our achievements in artificial intelligence. Thank you. Aleksandr Vedyakhin.</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN, HEAD OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICE &amp; SENIOR VP, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Thank you so much, Mr. Khasis. Well, there is a lot of hype around artificial intelligence, just a lot of hype. When we understood how to crystallize hype and not hype, there are 2 stories that categorize, the data and technologies, process modeling and decision-making.</p><p>Now a few more details around that. Well, Sberbankis not a lake or a sea, it is an ocean of data. We have a myriad of data for retail customers and for corporate customers alike. And they intertwine with each other. We have all the necessary technologies to analyze these data. And I would like to say that our data, our task is to do a AAA, so data should be accurate. That should be actual and accessible to make sure that you can get them in real-time mode. And that means that we navigate through that ocean of data with a AAA rating. Well, at least for the data.</p><p>Well, just one small question. How many events happen in 1 second in terms of social media or payments for our customers, for Sberbankcustomers? Do you have any guesses, please? In 1 second, how many transactions, please, any guesses? Well, just you're analysts. 10 million, 1 second. 10 million, really?</p><p>Some other ideas? So yes, we have some room for improvement. No, it's not 10 million, unfortunately. But in any way, in 1 second, you can see 14,000 or 15,000 events that happen. And that is very important. That means that our ocean of data is replenishing all the time and we have an additional opportunity to move ahead. We have some potential to unlock. But it is very important to go along these standards. This is crisp, you know that.</p><p>Well, businesses used to argue a lot with analysts: Who is better? Who is smarter than data scientists? Well, analysts are smarter, of course. But anyway, data scientists or business leaders. But fish, fish diagram explains everything. Each person is important in his area. So data scientists and business leaders are as important as well, they are -- they are very important in their areas. Sometimes like a shepherd of cats, why, why cats? Well, because cats is -- just scientists. I sometimes feel myself as a shepherd of cats because they are behaving like cats. But how about data scientists? They like to eat</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>You can talk a lot about each of these sections. And for the most hard-core cats, we have the AI lab that satisfies all their needs. Now why do we need that? We can make it remain as is. Why do we need to move forward? We're doing great. But no, our customers get great satisfaction from what we do, and their requirements grow all the time. And without complex methods, you cannot satisfy these needs. We started with very simplest things, now we go to AI. We cannot stop because customers cannot stop. They evolve, their needs evolve.</p><p>Now a lot of methods here, now GAN, G-A-N method here, please focus your attention on that. These are the very much-hyped network that are used for AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero who won the go game competing with humans.</p><p>Now why it is -- AI transformation is real in Sberbank. It's very simple. In 2018, we have around 250 AI initiatives and data science initiatives. And 650 data science and AI projects will be delivered by 2020, will be launched by 2020. And these are the words that we like, smarter systems, chat boards, conversational agents, HR performance analytics, this is all the words you like and these are all the initiatives that we are going to launch and that we have launched already.</p><p>How will it affect the customers? The time-to-decision for retail used to be 125 fields, 2 days. Now 11 fields, 4 hours and tomorrow, it is going to be 0 fields and real-time for decision-making. Why 11 fields? Sorry, we came to Mr. Gref. And Mr. Gref checks all the products of the bank himself. So, we said, Mr. Gref, we have great news, now we have Internet online loans, 125 fields. Then the CEO said 11 will be good. We said, okay, 11 fields. And then we made the application that delivers the loan in 4 hours and we only need to have 11 fields. But we understand that Mr. Gref is going on again but so-and-so, we will need 0 fields for the application and decision in real-time. As for the corporates, number of documents 50, 30 days time to decision. Now we have 21 days, 23 fields in less than 15 days. And this is what Maxim talked about, 0 fields and less than 1 hour to decision. This is how we support the goals. Now, Mr. Khasis talked about the platform that we've built. But dear friends, this is quite challenging. And we have applied AI to understand the behavior of our grid. So we've got quite a lot of insights. We start to reprocess the (inaudible) code based on the East's insights delivered by AI. And this is the result here. If the rebuilding of the model used to take 3 or 4 weeks, now to rebuild the model, you just need 3 or 4 hours. And this is the reality. I'll just reminisce about risk management. 1 slide only for risk management and 1 or 2 figures. Well, the first figure 130 bps that we forecast for cost of risk by 2020. The cost of risk is tightly related with the GDP, the correlation of around 70%. This is how our diagram looks like.</p><p>The next 4 figures that I would like to retain related to IRB, the first bank that went to IRB approach. Now these 4 figures are the following ones: As for the Russian accounting standards in 2018, we had plus 0.7 percentage points in terms of our capital adequacy; and in 2020, that will be an additional 0.5 percentage points. Therefore, plus 1.2 percentage points in the capital adequacy ratio and something that we delivered or have delivered already. The capital adequacy ratio for IFRS plus a [4.6] percentage points in 2018 and plus 0.4 percentage points in 2020. Therefore, it makes an aggregate of plus 1 percentage points according to IFRS. Now, just 2 figures for transition to IFRS 9. RUB 107 billion of additional provisions that will have to provide when transitioning to IFRS 9 and this is only 8% of all the provisions. Now why only 8? Well, because for the banks, for globally, this -- the average is around 15.</p><p>Now Mr. Khasis talked a lot about the ecosystem. This is what we strive to achieve. But we are risk maniacs, really. And we're the first bank in Russia that made a risk management for our ecosystem and for a new economy, and one of the few banks in the world that does high-quality risk management. These are the main principles presented here that are very much like the principles that we use to manage our standard risks. Thank you so much, colleagues. And good luck.</p><p>HERMAN OSKAROVICH GREF, CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; MEMBER OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Aleksandr, sorry, go back.</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN: Yes, it's just that we are so friends with Mr. Morozov, risks and finances cannot be divided. But HR can divide us. Really HR is a very pretty woman, who knows everything about us, and I will know even more as colleagues.</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; DEPUTY CEO, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Good afternoon. I understand that you're a bit tired because my colleagues talked about the business, about the current state of the business, about the ecosystem, about the technologies, about risks. But if you ask, what is the most important part? This is obviously our team. So I will try to be as entertaining. And as -- I will try to put it in a short summary, as Aleksandr did. And I would like to talk about mostly 300,000 people that work at Sberbank.</p><p>Now what are we going to do by 2020? What are our HR targets? We're going to get art and science in combination. Because first of all, we need to understand our employees like we understand our customers. At the same time, we need to state our employees how to -- they can promote themselves, how can they develop. And this is an art because it's very difficult to change ourselves because all the top managers are changing ourselves, they start with themselves. All our employees are trying to become a better version of themselves. This is how the culture of Sberbankis defined. And obviously for that, we equip them with the cutting edge technologies and cutting edge data processing systems. Who are these people? 300,000 employees. Now obviously this is the backbone of our business and these are young and beautiful Russian women, the majority of our employees. 92% of people working in our regional network are women and are our employees. And from them, 75% are women. And the average age is 34 years old. What do they want from us? What do they expect? They want to have a good manager. They want to be free of stupid processes, to make sure that their schedule is predictable because many of them have children, or perhaps, the possibility of working 4 days a week or to work from home in some days. That will improve their quality of life, and that will result in higher productivity for us. And you ask a lot about our productivity because you know that the employee costs makes a bulk of all of the costs of our bank. Now when we focus on our girls, we need to understand that these girls are delivering the best services to our customers for those banking products that we have already and the banking products that we are going to offer</p><p>within and as a result of the implementation of our ecosystem.</p><p>If you talk about our tri-modular organization, which consists of disrupt, change and run, well, it's better on technology and our headquarters is change and disrupt, and these are the men mostly, 75% are men. IT experts, men who know how to work with data, and they expect different things from us. They want challenging tasks, exciting job. They want large-scale projects. So they want to work in the same environment as Google. They like agile, they know how to implement DevOps. So they know what engineering culture is, and this is why we have created the largest agile transitioning project in banking. We have 1,200 teams that are working there. And then, we're going to have all Sberbanktechnology and all our HQ to agile. 10,000 people who are going to work in a very different culture in terms of producing new product. The products of the same quality -- the same high quality as high-tech companies deliver.</p><p>Now you always ask the question, how do you optimize this large headcount? Well, we have 3 levers here. First of all, we have created a quite an up-to-date, good model for strategic planning for the headcount, and this is what helps us to retain the employee cost at the same level at the same time our business grows. We understand where the headcount increases, what professions come and go. And each year, we discuss this area thoroughly. The second part is related to the fact that we are changing our structure and our Maxim to all that banks are hierarchal, multi-lever structure. Now obviously, I talk about agile and agile makes the structure much flatter, and we're talking about our regional network as well. Debossing and delayering, these are the techniques that we use there to make sure that the signal from the top goes quicker to the grassroot-level employees and to make sure that the top managers are closer to the girls that meet our customers at our branches.</p><p>And the third area, the part-time that I have already mentioned when a person works 80% of the time, meaning, that it has only -- this person has only 80% of the costs. But in the Russia where, in the branches, we need more people, obviously, and when there are not a lot of customers in our branches, then these girls can take a rest. Now how do we forecast that and how it works? You can see the results here. And if you look at our tech developers in our headquarters, IT and the business units that process data, you can see that they have risen significantly. Thanks to our -- thanks to the fact that we have created our dedicated business unit for working with technologies, which is called development technologies that we have created a value-added proposition for data scientists and we are competing with Yandex and Google companies. We know that -- you know that mathematicians are quite good in Russia. And thanks to the -- using the innovations that Lev talked about, and obviously, it gives a good effect in terms of the productivity, in terms of centralization for the functions, so that are more prone to automation and robotization.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We're often asked and where do you find such a number of people that you require, and Herman already mentioned, so far, we haven't learned to fly to Mars, so we have to do 2 things. On the one hand, we became very active recruiters. We met with the most renowned Russian universities, started hiring people from abroad. All of the people that we find important to us, we are ready to invite them and create good conditions for them. But of course, for such a big employer as Sberbank, there will never be enough to limit oneself to external recruiting. So we've got an excellent corporate university, which has been acknowledged as one of the best in the world. This year, we have set up the academy of data and technology there. And our big task for the next year, to have all of our 35,000 managers go through the data and technology training course. But on the other hand, all of our 12,000 developers and more than 500 people who are currently part of the data science community, we're going to train them in the banking business. And what's not least important, we're going to teach them in soft skills because I believe, many of you know the joke, what makes IT introvert different from IT extrovert, the introvert looks at the toes of his shoes, while extrovert is looking at the toes of the shoes of his conversationalist. So it's very important for these people to know how to communicate so that the teams that they're a part of to be much more effective. And this is exactly the plan that our corporate university faces for next year.</p><p>Besides, we're certainly very busy with the career development of our people. Whenever we are asked, are you sure that everything is all right in your case with succession? Yes, we are. If you take a look at the figures in terms of our appointments, the internal appointments were 84% from the top management appointments, and 96% from -- in the mid-management layer. We're continuously searching for talent and we are creating all the necessary tool sets in order for the talent to grow within. Because of that, the corporate culture attains a much more important significance. During the past strategy, we created 3 [valets] the leader, everything for the team and for the customer. We continue that in our new strategy. We put together new competencies in 2020 that all of our employees are going to adhere to, but certainly, the top management is most accountable. 35,000 of our top management by 2020 will possess new competencies, including digital skills, emotional intelligence and many other very necessary skills right now. We have formulated very precisely that our managers must conform to our corporate culture, develop their teams, invest into their people, set very exact priorities, develop the psychological skills because we believe that this is very important for deliver productivity and the principle that we are going to follow. It's either fit or you're out.</p><p>So we're going to undertake many other things in our corporate culture, which is about communication, training and development and the great office environment that we establish for our employees. And hopefully, there will come a day when we will invite many of you to visit these offices in Moscow. But I can tell you that, sometimes, very little change produces excellent results. The best change last year in our corporate culture was deemed to be the dress code change approach. And that's exactly why, today, we thought it appropriate to come out in front of you in jeans and T-shirts. If our employees really like it, since we said that we should start out with ourselves, then, sorry, you have to keep your words.</p><p>Now a few words about science. Our employees sit from the era of customers as well, and the way we develop the leg of data and offer our customers, we do the same for our employees, today, we have already 1,000 strong database with attributes about every person, including not only his or her HR data, be it about the socio type and the way these people communicate in networks, et cetera, et cetera. And on that basis, we come up with some interesting things, and I will tell you a few words about it. So far, we have produced that through our headquarters, but by 2020, we intend to establish this database, which would encompass all of our employees and, further on, apply artificial intelligence approach that Sasha referred to, we would be producing the kind of an HR analytic, which is crazily interesting because we all would like to know what are also -- this would help us to introduce these models into all of the basic HR processes such as recruiting went, for example, out of 10 candidates, which went short</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>successful employees in your division or immediately after the period of immersion, having taken a look at the individual performance for the first 3 months, we can tell, you certainly can leave this person in your team, but we think that he might be more successful over there, et cetera, et cetera. So helping our lead managers during the development stage and in other HR processes.</p><p>So this is what we describe as the people development platform, which is going help our employees to perfect themselves, will be part of a big HR platform, which we're building in the cloud, which every quarter is being updated and, through an open API, enables us to also build the HR tech start-ups that are currently emerging, a very interesting thing as well, which will be based upon contemporary processes upon centralized HR transacting using the voice recognition, state-of-the-art call centers. So all the technologies that you previously heard from our -- that we use for our customers, we're going to use for the sake of our employees in order to make life of our employee a happier one and in order to engage them and involve them into Sberbanklife and existence to deliver our strategy and improve the service for our customers. Because you know that at the end of the day, both business and technologies and even the profit that, in a minute, you will hear about from my colleague, Sasha Morozov, that is all coming from the people. So please know that you've got an excellent team, which shares in the strategy that we've introduced to you today.</p><p>So Sasha, the floor is yours.</p><p>ALEXANDER V. MOROZOV, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; DIRECTOR OF THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT, SBERBANK OF RUSSIA: Thank you, Yulia. While, finally, the time has come for boring financials. So let me tire you a little bit with my presentation that is going to contain a lot of boring figures. Many of you, definitely you know about, so let me not highlight many of them, just a few. So if you ask me, what is one very important figure that one would like to remember from my presentation? This is to get 20. 20. 20%. This is our ROE, which we intend to produce to our shareholders in the course of the next 3 years. Preferably for a longer term, certainly. This is very difficult. Let me remind you of the words by famous Russian writer (inaudible) back in the 1920s used to say, Moscow is cooking new life. This is a boiling kettle, and this is extremely difficult because you are part of that boiling process. So how we intend to produce this 20%? Well, in the next 12 slides, I'm going to try and tell you about the 4 basic drivers, which will do it for us.</p><p>First of all, we intend to increase our net income by 40%, more even than that. And our income is made out of interest income, which, under the narrowing margins, certainly will grow, but not as much as we would like it. But most importantly, that would not fall. It will grow by 10%. This is important. Then, fees and the principal difference from what it used to be so far because we take an ambition to grow them 1.5x, 50% upwards. For the first time, we are saying that we are ready to commit ourselves to the 50% growth within the next 3 years in our fee income, and that is a very important piece of [inspiration] because this is the key driver behind the profitable growth it will demonstrate in the next 3 years.</p><p>Next, cost of risk. Obviously, very obviously that from the current levels, it is going to diminish. But similarly, it is obvious that in order to maintain our interest income, we need to take on slightly bigger risk. And I'm going to talk about why it is going down just by a mere 20% and not more than that. And finally, the cost. Seemingly, what's special about it? Just muliply it by a 1, but it means that we're taking on the commitment that our costs are not going to grow. This year, for the first time throughout many years, we gave the guidance to our investors that our costs in group will be growing slower than the inflation, and we're going to stay true to this word. This is a harder commitment these days that our cost are going to grow lower than inflation at a pace of about 0.</p><p>Now let me just dwell upon these points. So the main component that currently gives us approximately 73% in our operational income is the net and the net operational margin 73% today. This is a lot, growth by 30% in our portfolio. Some reduction of the interest margin and the growth of the present margin through a different funding structure, and I will tell you about it.</p><p>So this is our asset and liability structure. And as you can see, they're growing at a different pace. 30% upwards is our operating assets are growing through 2 components, which is mortgage. And in mortgage, we do, let's just say, colossal possible growth by almost 3-fold during these subsequent years. 3-fold within this midterm horizon, the mortgage to 6% to 7% growth, which is a possibility to grow 3x. This is colossal growth. Small business.</p><p>The second segment, that is growing at a faster pace because it's a small business, not only a good margin but also a colossal in admission fees that we are making this is our second priority and [kin cause] certainly. Now on the side of liabilities, you can see, we're in advanced growth, we see this retail business developing, retail deposits. And this is our core funding. You would ask me, why [1.3, 1.2]? The answer is there at the bottom. Loan-to-deposit ratio is nudging upwards to a very stable significant 100%. We are relieving ourselves of excessive liquidity. And what is important to highlight here that we conform to, the best possible standards in terms of the retail base. And this is the first time I'm showing this slide, net stable fund ratio and liquidity coverage ratio. With more than sufficient lag, we do need these requirements. Now how do we manage to do that? And here, a couple of words, I will deviate slightly from the figures and will philosophize somewhat.</p><p>Now whatever we are having right now is the result of the kind of actions and decisions that we made yesterday, but where we're going to have tomorrow is what we are trying to decide today. We can influence that by proper decision-making. And the proper decision-making in asset liability management are the kind of decisions which affect our interest and margin. And that is the basic margin, the driver, [73%] to date. So approximately 5 years ago, we started cooperating with what was clearly risk growth, and that was when we started to have separate risk matrices trying to calculate separate drivers and the way they affect our decisions. To date, this is a big platform and I would like to tell you that it is already an established fact that this year, in 2017, absolutely, all of the interest decisions with respect to the changing rates and structures have been made upon a model analysis, model simulation, a comprehensive simulation of all possible consequences, both for the margin, for the profit, for the risk, for the capital, et cetera. Then on, we are delivering even a more comprehensive model, which in practically the real-time mode, enables us to simulate the overall demand and make it upon the social response models with the elements of artificial intelligence and with respect to all of this, is being done on grading. So that enabled us to make these calculations extremely quickly, not just in days and weeks, just minutes and hours.</p><p>Now what does it mean? This is 14 billion transaction simulations, more than 3.5 million contracts, 290 behavioral models, a whole series of them are self-learning. So what does it give us? That gives us something. You may ask now, is it too much or not to? (inaudible) 40 or 50 basis points. I mean, 50 basis points, excuse me, they're within the 2020 horizons, there's approximately RUB 150 billion of interest income. And I can tell you that this is a very conservative estimation.</p><p>Now through what? If you take a look, we do all the same things, but we do it in a much more rational way because we're going into the kind of language which is much more profitable in terms of ForEx because this is Rubles. We are moving into the kind of transactions in our liabilities, which produce to us much more of a liability, a passive margin because this is with that conscience and maturity, the certain accounts, current accounts, et cetera. We focus upon the kind of lending, which also produces the bigger margin, retail, something that we already spoke about, and another component, which is added here, a new one which is specifically [also accretive] available for lending. We are trying to get relieved of the kind of excess liquidity that we used to have and that is another top-off, exclusively RUB 200 million, which can additionally dedicate to the working assets.</p><p>If you can take a look, the loan-to-asset ratio, you may see that it is evolving from 66% up to 71%, and this is a lot, specifically through these kinds of components that there's a whole number of them as well. A little bit here, a little bit there, but overall, we're able to maintain a margin not only under our full control, but considerably higher than the average in the market today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.</p><p>A couple of words about fees and commission income. Today, we have 73% in terms of the interest income and a little bit less than 23% in terms of the fees. But we would like this to be lower and it will become lower. The interest margin will inevitably go down to 66% by 2020, maybe even below that, and that will be fully compensated by the growth in our fee income.</p><p>And here, the main components are listed. Yes, we can see that the importance of the transactions is growing, which are noncash from 31% to 41%. And effectively, that is an enormous potential in here because if we take a look at the European markets, the cashless transaction, sometimes, they reach 70%. The American market, 63%, 64%. We are just here, mere 41%, but it means that this is a long-term source of maintaining our fee income.</p><p>There are so many customers. Yes, indeed. Right now, we've got 1.6 million, but we do expect growth, which is going to be almost 1.5x. And this is a very little figure as well because this is a long-term source of growth for our fee income and that is very important. So these are the main components, but this is not yet everything because if we take a look at the businesses where we started investing just several years ago, we also presented to you our strategy when we were saying that Sberbankis launching pension funds, brokerage and insurance. That was just the beginning. Not what we're seeing now. We see that asset management, 5-fold growth; insurance business, 2-fold growth; brokerage, 4-fold growth within this timeframe, and this is not limit because within the mid-term period, if we take a look at the European outlook, so we can see the growth potential in terms of asset management, which could be 20-fold. And sure (technical difficulty) investments. But these are the kind of investments that Lev spoke about that we're doing right now, and that will give an effect tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. And we can see that by 2020, 11x, 11x, let me underscore, ladies and gentlemen, our revenues will be growing from these businesses that Lev described to you. So if we take a look at the share in our commission (technical difficulty) the kind of the battlefield where the main battle is going to take place with the technology peers. So this is exactly the field where we ought to be the best one. Well, obviously, that we are present not only Russian, we've got 14-plus regional presences globally without counting U.K., China and other countries where we don't have a banking license. But nevertheless, in terms of all of the main location where we're present, I would like to identify 1 particular statement (technical difficulty) firstly, all of our subsidiary banks, they are self-sustainable. And you can see this through their ability to provide themselves with liquidity and earn capital. This is one thing.</p><p>Second is that we want to be a good shareholder. And (technical difficulty) we will be a good shareholder. And in cases where we can deliver value to our shareholders, we will continue doing business. We will do everything possible to optimize our business in order to deliver to our shareholders a superior economic value-added result from all the businesses from wherever we are present. And this is a very important consideration. Let me not elaborate, I will respond to it during Q&amp;A if you have any questions then.</p><p>This slide describes what I have just told you because it shows the way we are allocating our capital. You can see that 82.3% of capital in the group is allocated into the Russian banking business, which produces 20% right now, 20% tomorrow and 20% the day after tomorrow. And this is our target, where the cost-to-income ratio in the Russian business, which is below 30%.</p><p>Then on, we have a Russian nonbanking business, which is exactly the kind of insurance, pension funds, brokers, asset managers, 21% ROE, even higher than in the banking business. 30%, et cetera. In this way, this picture underscores that we're absolutely consistent in a very disciplined way we manage our capital and allocate our capital in accordance with the kind of the capital adequacy and profitability that we can derive the opportunities from wherever possible.</p><p>It is another very important component is the next one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This is the third component of our equation that I presented to you, that's the cost of risk. As I mentioned, we are entering new products, sometimes more risky, have some in lending, credit cards, other products. Obviously, the cost of risk is higher there. Now that said, you can see that our cost of risk is going down overall. That became possible, and this is again a commitment on our part.</p><p>With the models that Alexander mentioned, we are increasing the risk profile, but we are bringing down the cost of risk. Very important. And we think that we can use these tools not just to grow our market share in promising markets and market segments, but to also support our interest margin.</p><p>And finally, our spending. It would seem that this is not complicated and this is boring, spending remains at the same level, we could have ended at that. But let me draw your attention. Yes, the spending is the same, but the structure is changing and it's changing radically. The spending related to IT is growing. Systems, innovations, we change from within. That is a crucible, a melting pot, and this is a crucible where we are boiling ourselves. The revenue, our spending on personnel is the same. But if you think about it, we change our personnel, we take guys from IT, artificial intelligence, data mining, et cetera, et cetera, these are different people. And to be competitive, a competitive employer, it's a very ambitious target that we are setting to maintain the spending on personnel as we have right now. Also, obviously, as the technologies develop, our physical presence is going to be shrinking.</p><p>That said, the target to maintain the spending at the same level looks a bit more ambitious than it would seem. The CIR is going down to 30%, and the indicator that you have been perusing always, saying that your cost income is a bit wrong for you, you can't really mention that because your interest rates are high, your margin is high. Cost income, bring it down within 2 percentage points. We think that this is a decent target and an ambitious target by any measure, no matter what the margin is.</p><p>And finally, the fourth element of our equation is capital. In all honesty, giving out a return on equity in ['18 and '20] is much simpler when equity is small, honestly. The less capital we have, the better the return. We've got the limations. And our regulations are the limitations and the regulations grow year in, year out. We are mandated to augment our capital adequacy from one year to the next. It is a regulatory requirement. We have to meet those requirements at any point in time. We must make sure that we, with a probability of 99%, and this is a requirement of Basel committee over the 3-month horizon. Whatever happens, we have to meet all the regulatory requirements for capital adequacy. That's the way we see it. Let me remind you that the Basel committee requires that we calculate historical volatility for a period of 3 years. One of them is a crisis year, the year of the most recent crisis. So the buffers come up, the management buffer and the buffer that was approved by the supervisory board, the Board of Directors of the bank and the capital adequacy buffer, that takes us to a level of 12.2% -- 12.5%, which is about the European average on our scale and our size in 2020.</p><p>Sensitivity, very important figure. Let me draw your attention to it. The highest sensitivity we've got is obviously the foreign exchange risk. A RUB 10 of change gives us 60 basis points affecting capital adequacy, credit risk. Interest rate risks are quite material as well. With that said, the foreign exchange risk is the main risk and our model assumes that over the projected period, the currency risk is going to be rather stable.</p><p>And in summation of my presentation, I would like to draw your attention to the 3 traditional financial targets that we set until 2020, and until 2018 as well. We are consistent, no twists. We are consistent step-by-step, every day of improvement, every quarter, every year. Yes, you can see that we commit to the cost to income ratio. A very important statement that I'm going to make. We do commit that all the promises that we made on our guidance have been delivered on. We actually commit to further improving our cost income. Our net interest margin is going to shrink a little bit, but not lower than 5.5, this is the obvious upside risk. We do commit that our fees and commissions over the midterm are going to be in mid-teens. And in summation, this is going to give us a double-digit EPS growth, which is as important.</p><p>And finally, equity. We are going to be consistent in building our capital adequacy up. That, in no way, is going to affect our ability to consistently increase the dividend payouts, as mentioned before, and as Mr. Gref, the CEO and a Chairman of the Executive Board is going to mention in his closing remarks.</p><p>HERMAN OSKAROVICH GREF: Well, colleagues, it has been a difficult morning so far. You've had a chance to fall asleep, to wake up. We added some more oxygen here. We saw the life come back in your eyes. Let me show you 3 slides. The last of which, you're going to take away with you in your pockets. The very first thing that I would like you to take away is the 3 of our key priorities, my priorities as the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Our staff, that is a foundation on which we're going to build the entire basis of our future success. Secondly, our clients, obviously. We don't work directly with our clients. We usually work via our employees. That's our front office, our back office, that's the people who create our technologies, all of them work with our clients. The clients is at the center. But the first element in the chain of my priorities is the employees. And the third priority is technologies. And that's my personal priority because in a non-technology company, transformation can be achieved only under the untiring supervision of the CEO. As you saw, there's not a single area of our society -- of our activity where we're not using technologies. Alexander, he was very quick and breezing through his presentation, thank him, because we're very worried, he's very fond of lecturing long and hard about the artificial intelligence and he did his talk today in a record time frame indeed. But all those dozens of initiatives in artificial intelligence for the bank next year, that's a huge number. That means that the maturity of a lot of elements in our business is rather high.</p><p>Another slide for you. This is where we were fumbling in the dark. We did fumble, but we did put ourselves on the right track. At this period of time, we did pay dividends, no matter remember hard we found for ourselves, and you did a good return on your investment. It was in EPS, it was in DPS. This is what we're going to have over the next 3 years. The size of the meatball is the size of the stuff that you're going to see in your pockets.</p><p>And the last slide that I would like to wrap up this first part, that's our strategy 2020. We asked the machine to interpret our strategy. Based on the analysis of our presentation, that's what it gave out. 20%. The most important indicator for our analysts, for our investors, the return on equity. If we show 20% of return, the machine said that this is the most important thing for you. Everything else comes secondary if that is achieved.</p><p>The 2 comprising -- 2 figures. RUB 1 trillion net income in 2020 and RUB 1 trillion of dividends that we're going to show to our shareholders over the 3 years. That's RUB 2 trillion. And 0, that's our commitment. We got zero chances to not deliver on the things we promise here today. I do hope that you will believe in our commitment. And I do hope that our track record will allow you to speak a very brief turn of phrase at the exit of this room.</p><p>I trust this team they will deliver what they promised. Thank you very much for your attention.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Let's try to keep it down to 15 minutes. So if you could be back in the hall at noon, it would be absolutely great to start the Q&amp;A.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Hello. Okay. Let's get our seat. Hello, everybody. Let's get our seats and get ready for the Q&amp;A. I have a couple of rules for the Q&amp;A. I would like you to present yourself when you ask a question. If you want to point the question to a certain management team member, please say so. Otherwise, we will pick who will answer. And thirdly, if you want to answer -- ask more than one question, please still answer -- or I mean, ask them one at a time. And the fourth is that I'm the boss and I can overrule anything, except when Herman Oskarovich says so. But let's start. Alex, he's the fastest even he's getting a bit old but...</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALEXANDER KANTAROVICH, MD FOR RUSSIAN EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is to the chief executive. It's been a good fun to watch how the bank developed in the last 10 years at your command. And I guess, my question is, why the strategy going forward covers only 3 years? And related to that, and I apologize for that, if you have any succession plan?</p><p>HERMAN OSKAROVICH GREF: Thank you very much for the question. I did try why the 3 years, maybe I wasn't as articulate as I should have been. We always had the 5-year cycle of planning. Unfortunately, what we have seen does not really make that time frame possible. We cannot develop a good quality document that will hold for 5 years out. The life has started to change very quickly. Technologies have started to change so quickly. The environment has started to change so quickly that this planning is meaningless. These are wasted efforts that give no added value. We have discussed this for a very long time, and we decided that the horizon, the outlook that we assumed is 2025. We try to glean the future 5 years -- or 8 years out. All our predictions, we tried to make in 2025. But the strategy of our own actions, we only planned 3 years out. We think this is the best practice for us. We're going to see how it pans out, but it is completely meaningless to hold forth on what we're going to be doing in '21 and '25 and '22. Thank God if we have guessed right all the trends, and that's a gigantic scope of work for the 3 years out. Actually, we assumed over the 3-year horizon that jobs that have to be implemented over 5 years in normal life, under normal circumstances. As for the succession plan, what Yulia has mentioned, the commitment of every executive to have 2 successors, that is mandatory for everyone, without exception. And as of today, we have a situation where every one of us, including me, has 2 potential successors. So far, I have not been able to spot any serious problems with that. Every member of our team is pretty much replaceable. Of course, you can't say that we are tolerant to a large amount of change as any company. We are limited in the volume of talent that we can tap and we are vulnerable to a potential huge departure of top executives. But if you noticed, last year, a significant number of people left when the VEB, Vnesheconombank, problem popped up. Sergei Gorkov had to go over to assume anti-crisis management. 55 managers, senior managers, left Sberbank, 2 of Vnesheconombank. And saying that we were badly affected in our development trajectory would not be fair. It was difficult to live through, but we did live through this. And we are glad that, now, there's another strong market on the team that is performing successfully. As for me personally, my contract with you is for another 2 years. I don't think we should make any wishes. I think, if we live as long as the end of 2019, we're going to see what happens. If you wish to fire me earlier, okay. You're going to have the opportunity whether you'll want to extend the contract with me, okay. It's too early to say that. We assumed all the excessive commitments right now. And you're going to have to decide that in 2019.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: The question is for Mr. Morozov, CFO. This is about dividend payout schedule. It appears to be some mismatch because 20% -- 50% payout really relates to earnings of 2019, if I understood it correctly. So how will it develop on earnings of '17, '18 and '19 -- '19 will not, it's 50% booked. In the interim, if you can share with us?</p><p>ALEXANDER V. MOROZOV: I'm going to be brief. You didn't understand me correctly. We intend to hit a 12.5 adequacy of capital for core equity Tier 1 capital by 2020. So in 2020, while a 2019 financial year, in this case, the dividends are going to be up to 50%, not 3 years, but 2 years. In our estimation, we're going to be able to pay the 50% for the 2019 financial year. We are talking about the dividends based on the 2017 and 2018. These are the years when we're going to be moving to the figure of 50%, gradually and consistently.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Microphone, please?</p><p>SAMUEL MAGNUM GOODACRE, VP, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Sam from Morgan Stanley. I've got 2 questions. The first one is on your very broad guidance for RUB 1 trillion. If I may, I don't think many folk in this room think you can't achieve that. I would argue it's quite conservative, particularly on the NIM. I think that you are being conservative. So where do you think the risks lie? And are you effectively saying that consensus is right or that there is upside risk to consensus. That's the first question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I guess, the backdrop of lower inflation, it is obvious that expecting lower interest margin should be there. We have to compete with the banking and nonbanking sector, that will contribute to that as well. In this respect, we try to make guidance very gingerly, very carefully on interest margin, and that was a projection that we gave in this presentation. Also, by way of adding, there's another third factor that is definitive here. This factor is the sharp decrease of inflation. Such a compression of interest rates that we have seen and will continue to see has never been an observation in history. And this will lead to a powerful impact on the banking margins overall. You can treat this as an accomplished fact. So if your models have not been incorporating these factors, I recommend strongly that you change them. I also think that the factor that you failed to account for in your models is refinancing of the mortgage portfolio that is actively happening. That has not been happening in the historical observations. The interest rates have never shifted that strongly, that quickly over such a short period of time. So do adjust your model for the refinancing of the current mortgage portfolio, over 60% of the portfolio. That will give you the necessary outcome.</p><p>SAMUEL MAGNUM GOODACRE: Yes, the regulations and the authorities in Russia particularly, whether they favor fintech or banks, and whether it's possible for fintech and banks to coexist and cooperate? Or if it is a question mark that Sber remains dominant and has to stop fintech from evolving? And would the regulator and would the authorities allow a coexistence?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'm sorry. The situation is not that original or different from the situation in, let's say, U.S. or EU. The regulator is quite tolerant in terms of presence of fintechs on the non-risk market, and quite tough in terms of regulation of the entrance of the new entrants of the risk-taken related market. This is a kind of a border that categorizes the attitude to fintechs. And Russia, in this sense, is not unique. I think that in the next 3 years, the regulators will have to review their attitude in terms of the presence -- towards the presence of the fintechs within the entire banking business. Now Aleksandr Vedyakhin told about us migrating to a new advanced approach, and we now face the problem that is the whole number of models that we apply. These models work as black box. So within themselves, within these models, AI is used. And the Basel requirements, the requirements of our regulator would not expect the banking models to be built on the following principles so that when we -- we won't be able to explain the link between the reason and the consequences. But our regulator is adjusting quite quickly, we have a good team there of very highly skilled experts. And I think that in some several weeks -- well, actually, we had a question whether we need to go to IRB approach or to forego the use of the models that are based on neural networks, and as a result, we found approaches that was good for both parties. And the speed of that negotiations was great. From the 1st of January, we're going to advanced approach. And I think that will be quite the same in terms of changing the attitudes towards the presence in the banking sector of fintechs because, well, basically, banks generate so much innovations right now that the regulator would not be able to abstract from this volume of innovations that are going to be accumulated to have the skill of responding to these things. So in terms of new players, if they will be able to do that, then the fintechs will be able to enter the market. In this sense, we -- well, let's put it -- we are creating a problem for ourselves. We are creating a much harsher competition field for ourselves. But if you pause this process, if you create a bottleneck for this process and just look at that, that makes no sense. These gates will be open soon. It will be great that these gates will are open when we are leading the way and not closing the gaps.</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY, RESEARCH ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Gabor Kemeny from Autonomous Research. First question is on your dividend policy. You linked the payout, the 50% payout, to a target, to a 12.5% target. Looks like you might there reasonably quickly. You are building capital to a quite significant pace, you will benefit from the IRB switch. What would happen if you get there before 2020? Would you be willing to raise the payout? Or let's say, if you get to 2020, would you potentially consider a higher payout? That's the first question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you so much for your question. Well, actually, this is why we cannot really fully answer the question on how -- on when it is going to happen. According to our estimates, it is going to happen as of the results of the 2019. But if it happens earlier, as a key target -- well, we have discussed it extensively during our supervisory board meeting. As a key target, we set 12.5%. If it happens earlier, then I think we'll be able to discuss the parameters of increasing the payout earlier. Yes, and the very important addition that I will have to focus your attention to is that our dividend policy that has been published today, and you can find it on our website, it has 12.5%. Yes, without the contracyclical buffer. Currently, this contracyclical buffer in Russia is 0. This is the regulator decision to implement it. If this contracyclical buffer is going to be implemented, we are going to be fully compliant with the regulations of Russia and in all countries of our presence. Yes, it is very important to note that the bank must comply with all the requirements of [ICAP] and to complete all the stress tests unsuccessfully, this is a very important thing to say. Well, this is fully written in the document that we -- that is published. I hope you would be okay with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Higher than 50% if we...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, it is possible. It is possible we don't need excess of capital. Moreover, we're now facing the discussions, the debates in terms of people saying let's pay more. But we say, sorry, they are colleagues. The situation is as follows: First of all, we are interested and all the top management is interested in getting more and more profits because we have an unprecedented high share of our non-transferable payments, which is related to our profits. 2 years ago, our motivation was changed, where 40% of our income were linked to the price share -- to the price of the shares, which is not only related to the net profit but to the dividend payout. And another very important indicator is ROE. We're not interested, and Alexander talked about that, we are not interested in having an excessive capital adequacy ratio because it would generate the challenges in terms of the returns. So we are on the same boat with you. But there is a one but, however. We are discussing right now the dividend payout with the capital adequacy ratio of around 9.7%. So we are not fully capitalized compared with any other large financial institutions and banks. And another important problem, colleagues, that you don't -- you need to keep in your head, is that we cannot raise capital from abroad and we're responsible for long-term sustainability and stability of this financial institution. So everything that I've told before is based on the understanding that we are not going to go to get the funds from abroad, to get the capital from abroad because this is not possible. And we need to ensure the tolerance of this institute, this is [imminently] important institute to all the external shocks that might arise. This is the foundation, the backbone of our activity and we are morally responsible.</p><p>And fiduciary -- we're fiduciary responsible for that. And this is our job, basically. So I mean, I don't think there's anything to add here. The motivation system is aimed at us being committed to you, and we are going to give you all the excessive capital because we're interested in that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Another questioner.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And finally, over a 3-years' time frame, do you see any potential changes in your ownership structure in 3 years' time? Do you see Sberbankbeing majority owned by the Central Bank?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, colleagues, this question -- if this question, you can address to our main shareholder.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, next question. Yes, there with...</p><p>OLGA VESELOVA, EQUITY BANKING ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Olga Veselova, Bank of America. My question is about a part of presentation you targeted -- your targets, which, I assume, is in nobody's models. This is about nonfinancial consumer-oriented services. If we talk about RUB 1 trillion target of net income, could you share with us your assumed split of income between banking, financial services and nonfinancial consumer services? This is my first question.</p><p>HERMAN OSKAROVICH GREF: Well, in my presentation, I showed that the share of nonbanking business in non-interest rate-related income will be around 8%. If you talk about operational income before provisions, not less than 3.5% in full operational income. This is a nonbanking business that we are launching right now.</p><p>OLGA VESELOVA: My second question is to Alexander about net interest margin as a follow-up to the previous question. To me, actually 40, 50 bps erosion over 3 years is possibly generous. So I think my question would be, what are your underlying assumptions about erosion of asset yields and dynamics of the cost of funds for the next several years? And what margin support you would assume to come from the change in loan to deposit ratio?</p><p>ALEXANDER V. MOROZOV: We see that our net interest income, thanks to the decrease of the margin at the horizon of 3 years, is going to decline by somewhat RUB 235 billion, RUB h billion. It will be generated by SSI fields' decrease on the liability side. It is going to be offset by us by growing the accounts without the contractual maturities. The growth of assets will give us around RUB 350 billion, RUB 360 billion in net interest and interest income. So it is going, actually, to grow. The aggregate interest income is actually going to grow a little bit. If you look in my presentation, that is going to be published on our website, it contains all of the figures that you need for your analysis. And if you are going to use your model, you will end up with the results that you need. I hope I answered your question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Mikhail.</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV, EQUITIES\u00c2\u00a0ANALYST, VTB CAPITAL, RESEARCH DIVISION: Good afternoon, Mikhail Shlemov from VTB Capital. The first question is actually to both Alexanders, and that's actually on the cost of risk. Looking at your cost of risk assumption, 130 basis points, especially in the environment of much slower loan growth, which were most likely, in turn, also looking to your forecast. And actually, comparing probably to the comparable countries in the Central and Eastern Europe, the base of the cost of risk looks a little bit (inaudible) to high but peers in Central and Eastern Europe probably would be somewhere below 100 BP. Probably, if you could elaborate how the 130 basis points cost of risk is basically split between the changes, which we have either in the loan mix base but going into the riskier segments.</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>was in the delinquencies over the next 3 years or would not see the credit cycle turning at this point.</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN: So I perhaps I will answer that question. Thank you for your question, Mikhail. I think this is the favorite question of all the analysts. First of all, I'd like to say that Sberbanktraditionally adheres to conservative policy aimed at ensuring the sustainability of our guarantees that we can deliver these stable financial results that you are seeing right now. If you talk about details, there are several factors. First of all, I'd like to reiterate, we are a major proxy for the Russian economy. Therefore, the correlation of the growth of the change of the GDP growth and the cost of risk is around 70%, according to our models, just for you to understand the picture. Therefore, something that Mr. Morozov mentioned already, at part -- no, it's just that the structure of our credit portfolio changes. We have an increase of the part of the credit portfolio, which is related to higher risks and with higher income. This is something that we offset to offset the change of our margin. And if you look at the distribution of the portfolio, we took the left part of this portfolio, actually. We're focused on it more. This is the part of the portfolio, which has a lower credit rating. So if we are going to grow, if we want to grow organically, we need to grow with the customers with higher risks. We are still conservative. But nevertheless, we will have to move forward in this sense. And therefore, we have been able to achieve 1.3. Talking about IFRS 9, the onetime hit will be around RUB 107 billion. That is going to be covered by the capital as of the 1st January 2018. And then we are going to go along the path that we set for ourselves, along the targets, 1.3 of cost of risks. So perhaps, these are the major principles. Mr. Morozov, perhaps, no, I think, you have answered the question in full. If you need some other information.</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV: And then second question is actually again regarding the capital and especially the way how you calculate it. Apart from discussion of the current level, the capital adequacy, and first of all, a little bit surprised by the 9.7% capital number, which given (inaudible) gave because as far as I remember...</p><p>ALEXANDER V. MOROZOV: It's by the Russian standards. If you speak about the IFRS, it's at 10.5%, I think, yes.</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN: At the -- yes, so this is TFM at N20.1. This is our expectations. This is the Basel III level according to the Russian accounting standards calculated according to RAS. This is the most problematic bottlenecks that we have. If you talk about the IFRS 9 for the group, our estimate is around -- more than 10.5% by the end of the year</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>ALEXANDER V. MOROZOV: (technical difficulty) decisions in terms of what to do with the dividend payout, you have to look at this N20.2 rate.</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN: No, when we make a decision, we look at IFRS and Basel III, and this is the group level. It's clearly stated in written form in our dividend policy.</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV: That part of the capital question is obviously risk-weighted density. While we do appreciate that the phasing of the RB approach would gradually happen over the course of the next 3 years, whatever do you see any levers in terms of the bottom-up approach to optimize either the asset structure and asset mix, perhaps the structuring, for example, mortgage books, supersizing part of the book or basically cleaning of balance sheet commitments, if you have any and if they do wait on risk-weighted asset density.</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN: Yes, perhaps, I will start and Alexander will continue. You fully understand our commitment to go into this advanced approach. And it has a long-term goal of consistently decreasing the RWA density, which will take some time. There are some regulatory requirements, which are quite specific. You need to understand that Russia is on the brink of investment rate in which, obviously, limits the risk weights, which is in accordance with the Basel requirements. But the central bank is using foreign number of investments, including the investments in the government securities that have a risk weight of 100%. Within this, I guess, since the implementation of the full effect from this approach will be seen in a number of years. So this is not a one-off effect. And if you talk about some details, then, yes, really, thanks to the IRB approach, we have the opportunity of implementing such approaches, like (inaudible) and is going to be implemented on budget planning by -- from 2019, from 2018. It is going to be implemented as part of a monitoring project. And now we didn't have choice before, so we couldn't have get big results from standardized, but we have improved quickly. This year, we improved by 0.3%, and it was reflected in the report for Q2. And IRB gave us very a high-quality tools. And by applying these tools for the perspective of -- for 2020, the indicator that you are concerned about and we are concerned about will be around 90%.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: With your permission, I would like to mention another argument that is sometimes omitted to operation risk, where in fact, one sees a certain vicious cycle, the more we earned, the more, following the standard approach and the operational risk estimation, we need to put in our way further operational risk, which backs up to 15% from the operational income. So there is a bit of a dependency here in terms of the standard approach in operational risk. Principal -- I mean, that's with the majority of the banks and we follow that in the foreseeable future, we don't see it possible to switch to a different (inaudible) 15% from the operational income is in the operational risks area. And certainly, very important to events that we should be mindful of, switching to Basel III as of October 1 and IFRS 1st of January, which it's up 1 percentage point of our capital. So all of the work done during the previous years, thanks to our risk team and our finance team led to us being the first ones who start applying the advanced approach, which will compensate for 0.6 percentage point out of that percentage point we lost. And up to 2020, the guys promise full compensation and an additional 0.4 percentage point through bringing in new assets and further improvement in the model. This is a really great support because the capital adequacy issue is the key one for us, currently.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Middle.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) British Columbia Trade (inaudible) Investments. It's been fantastic to get very different perspective on the bank. And while your success over the past years is commendable, so this allows us to see how you are set up for the future. So now just perhaps speaking slightly out of tune from the -- to the previous questions, you are committing yourself -- yourselves to 50% dividend payout ratio, which, under certain circumstances, and as we know that the macro is a big driver for the banking system in many countries, this could be a challenging target. And you have mentioned in your presentation the various flexibility, so essentially, by doing so, you are using the flexibility of the bank. So ultimately, as a shareholder -- as shareholders, we are interested in total return on our investment, which is the share price appreciation as well as dividend. So over, I suppose, the longer term, the benefit of having capital flexibility, especially in a country where you have 6% mortgage penetration only, mortgage to GDP penetration, where the overall banking system is not well capitalized. Couldn't you see opportunities going forward to grow your loan book at a faster pace than 10%, which would be assumed by your payout calculation? So this is sort of one question. Now obviously, as the bank that is majority owned by the Central Bank of Russia, you are not immune to the overall budget discussions, et cetera, in Russia. And to what extent your decision to pay out 50% of your income is driven by the request of the -- by your sort of conversations with the Ministry of Finance? And then if this is the case, to what extent, in your view, it makes sense or it makes sense in the</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>a bank to land and leverage this capital at the multiple of 10, which would support the economic growth over long term.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. So the first question was can we grow the loan book faster than 10% per year?</p><p>ALEXANDER V. MOROZOV: Thank you very much for your question, and thank you for your position. Not often it is encountered. We've had a lengthy debate as to what might serve as a trigger, which will help us pay this very much sought-after 50%, which is the kind of figure that everybody is waltzing around, brimming of it. I should say that we have indulged very strongly, both our shareholders in the fiscal structures which are behind them. First of all, there is no problem about it because nobody is worrying about having to save us and pump capital into us. No matter hard it is and tough it is around, it's not as much as we don't asking for being saved. We're always paying dividends on top of it. And we have become, in many ways, the hostages to this situation. So you've very precisely described the kind of the debate that we've been part of recently. And the very same kind of an argument that you mentioned, I referred to in my discussions with the shareholders, including the fiscal authorities that want to get more out of us. Don't you find that the kind of choices you may face is that we currently have 9.5% asset growth? Nobody knows what kind of an asset growth there will come. So what if it's 10.5%? What if it's 12.5%? What is more important for you? To get a one-off dividend payment from us as much as possible and stop our growth and, at the same time, with the kind of ability to affect the whole of the economy. In the country where we operate, we'll end up having the whole of the GDP under shock. And you will simply destroy a very good operating machine, pushing us into a noncompetitive corner. But this is the kind of a debate which is on the surface. And in the recent letter that we have received, it was stated that the 50% approach is shared by all of the shareholders, and this is not the case. As far as I can see, you are not sharing it. We'll certainly like to get as much as possible and sell off in the peak. Long-term investors are not interested in this. We are responsible for the long-term development and the resilience and stability of the structure. And that is why we are going to search for an optimum balance, including the stations when such of such indicators, like portfolio growth might turn out to be slightly different than what we would like it to be. So long-term stability, like I've said, and the ability to be fully competitive in the market will be the core basis when this decision is being made. If I may add another figure for you to run your calculations in approximate level of sensitivity to the loan portfolio growth by 1 percentage point is within 1/10 of a percentage within capital adequacy ratio. This is important for modeling. And the second point I would like to draw attention to after the Investor Day is always -- is over to take a close look at the chart, which was shown in the final word by the banks here about the CPS and DPS. It was very important for us to be able to arrive at a compromise between the growth and the value investors. And so we believe that the proposed formula is something that really makes it happen, so we do have the necessary resilience and capacity. Yes, and another thing, this particular point took us 2 hours to heatedly discuss with our directors. One of our nonexecutive directors is here and he will vouch-safe for me. [Nadia] where are you? Yes, over there. And the result was such that every word was scrupulously considered. And there was another thing written there, not below 12.5% in the capital adequacy rate. And we've got 12.5% capital adequacy, but we also see that the sharks are looming that may lead us to reducing the dividend payment. So we would always look 12 months ahead. If the situation is</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>as we've finished 2013 accidentally and by the point of dividend payout, everything was stable. All the performance was great. But we were able to see the way situation in macroeconomics was evolving. So we were aware that sharks were coming and that had to be taken into account whenever such sharks are obvious. For example, the oil price goes down to $25 per barrel or down to $20 per barrel. So evidently, by demonstrating excellent result, but being aware of the sharks coming, we'll need to take this into account. So read attentively behind every word. There is a lot of thinking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) from SberbankCIB. My question is for Mr. Khasis. You outlined a lot of very interesting projects within the digital ecosystem. And I'm just wondering whether during the scope of this 3-year strategy, you think any of these businesses will be generating sufficient scale to think about starting thinking about exit strategies, potentially monetizing these businesses. And if that's the case, would you think about some special distributions to shareholders, such as the special dividend or a buyback?</p><p>LEV A. KHASIS: Well, as I mentioned, we've got technical investments, which help us resolve certain technical problem and strategic ones. Within the 3-year time frame, I think that our biggest project certainly will be in the e-commerce area. And our agreement with Yandex provides for both Sberbankand Yandex within the 5-year period to be entitled to go into public placement. Now whether this will be an exit strategy or when we are not going to reduce our share, but will remain a shareholder in the public entity and simply will reflect upon our books a fair market value of the subsequent assets remains an open issue. But I would tell that, that will be part of the next strategy period, which will be beyond 2020. But overall, like I've said, we hope that, at least, we will have 3 or 4 projects, which will be so compelling, so as to claim to be the reason for a whole separate IPO. And every time within any event like that, we will be making up our minds whether we would go out or not. But the majority of those projects are longer term. And we do not anticipate any quick exiting. It's a different matter that an IPO case for the purpose of the fair value, that could be definitely a real story.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Your capital structure, do you envisage the current structure of common and preferred shares still being in place at the end of this strategy period?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: The 50% of the Central Bank?</p><p>LEV A. KHASIS: I see. Do you want me to start? Well, there is a longer answer and a shorter one. The short one is that today, this is not what we see as an urgent thing. If you need a longer answer, then one will have to give a bit of an explanation. So if you're willing, then after the meeting, we can give you all the details because there are some problems related to this. All right, let's not forget, dear colleagues, that right now, we are under sanctions. And there are certain limitations related to some subjects, which we need to pay heed to whenever we hear. Otherwise, there's a possible change in our shareholdership. One situation changes, quite possibly, our attitude towards it might also change.</p><p>YULIA GERMANOVNA CHUPINA: That does not include the risk of more U.S. sanctions on sovereign debt -- extended to sovereign debt, both new and existing debt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (technical difficulty)</p><p>maybe you can clarify that? And anyway, what is the probability that you assign to that happening next year? And how would the guidance check?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Look, you'll be better off directing this question not to us, but to those who produce these sanctions because we definitely have very weak capacity in giving a precise estimation of what these sanctions might be. The probability, the variability, which can be infinite is something that one should rather not deal with. You may draw up as many fearful things as you might, but it's very unproductive. We act on an assumption of the most probable scenario. Nobody excludes any black swans or any additional sanctions appearing, which is one of the black swans. We are -- certainly are trying to predict what our response might be to such developments. But I wouldn't really waste my time on such things today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Here in front, sorry.</p><p>MIKHAIL GANELIN, SENIOR ANALYST OF FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TRANSPORT, ATON LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mikhail Ganelin, Aton financial analyst. I have a question regarding your corporate lending focus. So you forecast 6% growth -- early growth and -- which is close to what we see this year. Am I right that you -- you're quite cautious regarding thought of credit expansion regarding corporate lending despite we see falling rates on corporate lending, falling key rate, et cetera? So do you quite skeptical that we will not see investment cycle in Russia or -- but only consumer financing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you very much. Well, first, we hope that you are right, okay? And it would be great, we would all win. Is there such a probability? Yes. We are currently in the electoral cycle, and we all hope that this cycle is going to end in seeing the reforms stepped up across the economic landscape. And it is entirely possible that the corporate portfolio will grow at much higher rate. For us, this will only be a positive. How will it pan out? It is impossible to predict today. So what we assume is the consensus projections for GDP growth and the ensuing monetary and all the other macro indicators, including the indicators for our portfolio growth, there's assume some growth in our share of the market. So any other scenarios are entirely possible, but do let's leave and see. I think in 1 year, we will be able to see and make more accurate and more probable projections.</p><p>MIKHAIL GANELIN: Cooperation with Alibaba, what is kind of status there because there was rumor that you came to an agreement (inaudible)?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Our agreements with Yandex envisages that over the horizon of 12 to 18 months, you do know that there are -- not just Alibaba, there are other companies, at least 1 major player there is in China who will continue these negotiations. We will make an agreement with someone, but making any projections right now is an ungracious business. Right now, this is a status that...</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>VUGAR ALIYEV: Even if they're very willing to dance, unless you mind, I'm going to put the question in Russian. Vugar Aliyev. I'm from KPMG. I'm not an investor here. I'm just a listener, a person who would just like to listen to Sberbank's Strategy 2020. My question is not entirely connected with finance. It's more related to risks. Very interesting presentation that was. And I was really struck with a level of involvement that Sberbankhas exhibited on the implementation of AI solution -- solutions. My question is probably directed to Aleksandr Vedyakhin, risks and implementation. What areas of Sberbank's activities you see practical implementations of AI these days? What is the role? And what is the level of using AI in decision making? What are the risks related to that implementation? And how do you manage those risks? How do you tackle those?</p><p>ALEKSANDR A. VEDYAKHIN: You're not really being kind to me and I'm about to take offense. Where do you come from? KPMG? TPG? KPMG, KPMG, okay. Well, we haven't really worked with you that much. It's not just Vedyakhin that plays with AI. Lev Aronovich did say that he is maniacal about</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>but only if only Vedyakhin does these things, then Sberbankdoes not have anything AI in Sberbank. Well, firstly, I do artificial intelligence. Yulia does artificial intelligence. Lev does that. Alexander does AI. Even Aleksandr does AI because that is a problem. For financiers -- he got stuck on one slide. For financiers, this is a problem. He showed on that slide application of AI newer networks for managing asset and liability management. I got a bit nervous, but then I rejoiced because moving financiers to implement AI is not that simple, let me tell you. There's another area of great bankers that find it very, very difficult to adopt modern technologies. That's investment bankers. That's a grating (technical difficulty). We've dealt with them, so telling them, explaining it to them that they are, a, not as great as they think. Yulia uses a term self-reflection. They look at themselves in the mirror and they don't see the cats, the proverbial cats that Alexander mentioned, but they see lions, all right, Whereas they're not even the cats. And this is a major problem. I think the ice has moved, to use a Russian idiom. Alexander said that 250 projects are going to be seeing the light of day in artificial intelligence. That does mean that we have broken the ice. This year, we've got just over 150 AI projects. In every single business block in Sberbank, we have a data science engineer. That is part of the data science community that Alexander and his colleagues foster and nurture. We have a Chief Data Science Officer. We have a Chief Data Officer that is in charge of data factory. And we have a Chief of AI lab.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: These are a bit diverse tracks of activity, but what that gives you is, today, everything in cybersecurity is built based on AI. There has been some mentioning about our security operations center [by zone]. Just one company, our company did that. That was completely impossible manually if the guys had not (inaudible) launched that engine based on newer networks. And this is great news because the bad news that this year hasn't seen a qualitative shift on the part of AIs -- on the part of hackers. Hackers have gone into AI. And the viruses have become much more dangerous and much more able to self-learn to clear the various defenses. And if we had not prepared ourselves, we would have been very -- in a very bad shape. So right now, this is an endless competition. This is a competition without any end to it. We have to be one step ahead of the curve. So yes, we are fanatical. We are fanatical believers in that the future of all the companies lies in AI. And the companies will find themselves on the frontier of this funnel of tech adoption, finance. These are data-driven companies. These are out-of-shell intelligence-driven companies. (inaudible). thank you. I can tell you about the risks, all right? Well, obviously (inaudible) and that is also very important to understand. So the approach to risk that I showed you, the MIT circle, that decreases most risks. Besides aggressive modeling, the validation business unit has been growing very strongly. The internal audit business unit is growing. They ordered both the modelists and validators. And now we are implementing a very good dialogue with the Central Bank, our regulator. They also have started looking for approaches to regulate the model risk as a fourth line of defense. And in my opinion, in the shortest time frame, the finance risk is going to be migrating towards more of model risk and AI risk. But this is just (inaudible) question comes, guys, how do you control this? And this is the focus of attention constantly. The other side is not done by us. The validators are always a separate business unit. That's what Maxim has told you for a long time. This is the very first part of mass personalization. This is all based on AI. The entire mass personalization, customization is based on AI. It's not possible without that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible) there was a hand up over there.</p><p>MARIA SEMIKHATOVA, VP AND ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maria Semikhatova, Citibank. We're quite aggressive cost efficiency targets, so if you are in a position to comment what it means in terms of headcount and branch network. And second, what is the view on the market share, specifically in the growth areas, such as mortgages and CDs and credit cards? There seemed that all the initiatives you are taking will allow you to preserve the market share or you will be able to grow it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, your question, the first question really kind of triggered me to give you a prompt response. Anyway, you want the hanky-panky or you want to go? What are you worried about, the number of our people or the number of our branches?</p><p>MARIA SEMIKHATOVA: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We showed you the super ambitious targets for cost income ratio. Why the hell do you care how much headcount are we going to have? We're going to hire twice that many people and we're going to expand the branch network 3 times. If we hit the CIR, why would you care? Why do you want to show that kind of an interest to this? Because I can't really give you an answer to this because -- and I would not like to take away from this</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>And that's about 8,000 officers is rural network. That's 1 or 2 employees max. Sometimes -- actually, it's even less than 1 employee per branch. And if you look at the influence of how that affects the cost, the influence is</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>the thing that I truly hope that we're going to achieve those targets. How are we going to do this? That's the second question. As for redundancies, that is again a very sensitive issue, as you will understand. But obviously, the number of people will be going down. The amount of automation will have to see some redundancies. We do build the ecosystem. So a lot of new features of the ecosystem and new objectives in the ecosystem will require the effort of retraining factory that Yulia mentioned. We do value our people because these people went with us through very difficult times. And they were imbibed. They are imbued with our culture. We learn to give the right skills to our employees, the right financial skills, the right technological skills. The most difficult thing is the change of soft skills. And if these people are steeped in our culture, we try to preserve them</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>some locations, but we try to retain up to 100 people that do present value to us. Mr. Gref, if I may, I would like to add. I did try to take that message across in my presentation. Please, our CEO and our executives had very -- had it very difficult to get used to part-time. Part time, please get used to this, part-time will be one of the methods of managing cost. Please learn another 2 words. One is retaining, Mr. Gref mentioned that, part-time is going to be the second word. Yes, and also the second part of the question, the shrinking of cost for property maintenance, real estate. There's another transformation going on here. We set ourselves, again, very ambitious objectives to let go of the properties we don't need. But Maxim mentioned in his presentation, the intellectual -- the intelligent management system that allows us to shrink the number of management layers and the headcount involved in management purely is not that necessary. So we don't need that much properties. Last year, we offered this program called (inaudible) policies. And now we are pursuing that as a 2-pronged effort. One prong is we sell. Next year, we are supposed to sell in excess of 650,000 square meters, close to 1 million or a bit different on these figures. Well, it's between 160 -- 650,000 square meters and 1 million. Lev is responsible for this. So he's probably -- his figure is probably right. But this is a material downsizement of property portfolio. We analyzed our entire property network. We've got a full database of all our properties. Last year, we completed a complete inventory of all the properties. And we have a very ambitious plan to realize all of them -- some of them. The structure of use for properties is changing. We have to increase the volume of properties in Moscow because the headquarters was relatively understaffed as compared to other regional banks. And if we took a tech company, then a lot of people come on the disrupt element and change element. And that, as a rule, means increasing headcount in the central head office -- in the HQ. Last year, we launched 2 new offices, 2 new properties in Moscow, that's the new Agile Home in Kutuzovsky Prospect Avenue, about 250,000 square meters, a huge property, and a property in (inaudible) again about 70,000 square meters of useful area. This is essentially -- an essentially new quality of office space. This -- on Saturday, we open a new data center in Skolkovo. Instead of 2 years, we only spent 18 months in commissioning it. Over the next 6 months, it's going to gradually assume all the transactions. We're going to have a full foothold, 2 data centers, 50-50, the stand-by -- the stand-in capabilities is going to be [capped]so it can plug itself in hot. And the share of the market in mortgage, in credit cards, we have relatively high market shares. In mortgages, I don't think we're going to be able to build it quickly. We intend to maintain that share of the market at around the same level. As for the credit cards, it might actually see an increase, a slight increase.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I have to start wrapping up. But before I give the final word to our CEO, we'd just like to say from our rest of team that very much thank you for coming today. We will be on the road very actively after the New Year, so we'll hope to see you all wherever you are, in your home cities and home countries. And then after this final words, we will have lunch downstairs. And last, but not least, happy holidays.</p><p>HERMAN OSKAROVICH GREF: Dear colleagues, dear investors, our dear shareholders, first off, by way of wrapping up, I would like to express our thanks for you for coming. And the number of investors, we have an unprecedented number of participants in this strategy session, so this is a great honor for us. Thank you very much for it. Thank you very much for listening to us so graciously and attentively. We felt a very benign atmosphere. Understandably, we were very nervous. Today, we left this room about 2:30 a.m. in the morning, in the early hours because we tried to get the sense of the platform of the venue. We'd rehearsed trying to convey not just the figures, but the overall mood and the emotions that we feel while we work on what we do. The ambitious goals that we have set ourselves, you have to be a bit adventurous to set those goals. But firstly, I have said that we do believe that this is the right thing to do. And in all honesty, this is very interesting. I'm not interested in doing banking. I'm a bad banker. I do not believe in banking. And I'm going to do everything to take banking to its proper place. In the future, banking should be, at best, here on my mobile device. In the worst case, it shouldn't be everywhere or nowhere at all, and that's where it's going to be. It's inevitable. No matter what the bankers think, no matter how willing they are to grab the tail of a dragon flying off and the conviction of the inevitability of this and our interest in seeing that happen, in seeing the new way of banking, in seeing the nonbanking, but the client being the source of our entire wealth, it's understanding. And the ability to resolve the issues of the client the best way possible, that is what we find the most interesting. That -- that's what gives us a drive. That's what gives us all the ambition. And this is what really turns us on, the entire team. And we will do everything in our power to achieve success. No one knows how successful we are going to be. But the foundation that we have laid, as we think, does give us a good chance to achieve what we promise. So thank you for voting, your faith in us by buying, by spending your dollars and other units. So, a, thank you; b, greetings, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year. And on behalf of our entire team, first, do stay with us, so we can grow your wealth; and two, we would like to wish you very strong health, good luck, harmony and happiness to you and yours; and third, we prepared a video in summation. Hopefully, you can take away good spirits as you leave this room.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes U.S. President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist. While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 U.S. elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors'offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors'offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to reappear days after that complaint.</p><p>Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes U.S. President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist. While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 U.S. elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors'offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors'offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to reappear days after that complaint.</p><p>Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes U.S. President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist. While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 U.S. elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors'offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors'offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to reappear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-yearold Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.

There was just one catch: None of it was true. The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor \u2014 and sometimes President Donald Trump \u2014 to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more. Those incentives don't exist. While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly \u2014 and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads \u2014 they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner. Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads. The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections \u2014 and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation \u2014 loom. 'This is definitely concerning \u2014 definitely, it's misinformation,' said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. 'I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.' AdvertisingExperts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms. Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only. The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them. 'That allows people to do more dirty tricks,' said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program. In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them. 'These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,' company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. 'We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.' AdvertisingFacebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies. Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as 'you can get paid to go solar.' Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time. After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for 'free' solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release '$100 million solar incentives.' He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be. 'It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,' Fitzpatrick said.The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address \u2014 a mailbox in Carlsbad, California \u2014 that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company \u2014 then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough \u2014 for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records. Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.Most Read Business StoriesThough the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers. Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. 'That's how this whole process plays out.'

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p>The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p>Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine.

There was just one catch: None of it was true. The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor  and sometimes President Donald Trump  to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more. </p><p>Those incentives don't exist. While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly  and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads  they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner. Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads. The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections  and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation  loom. \"This is definitely concerning  definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\" Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms. Last year, Facebooklaunched a searchable databasethat provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its owndatabase of ads and promoted tweets. Google has anarchivefor political ads only. The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them. \"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program. In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them. \"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\" Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies. Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\" Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them. Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time. After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be. \"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said. The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address  a mailbox in Carlsbad, California  that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company  then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough  for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records. Akatiffsettled the allegationswithout admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business. Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers. Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\"</p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2019 BridgeTower Media.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p>The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor \u2014 and sometimes President Donald Trump \u2014 to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p>Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly \u2014 and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads \u2014 they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections \u2014 and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation \u2014 loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning \u2014 definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address \u2014 a mailbox in Carlsbad, California \u2014 that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company \u2014 then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough \u2014 for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings.</p><p>Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.</p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-141617624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT2-HWY1-F11P-X2TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings.</p><p>Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.</p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice-president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\"</p><p>--</p><p>Associated Press investigative researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor   and sometimes President Donald Trump   to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.Those incentives don't exist.While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly   and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads   they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. </p><p>It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections   and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation   loom.'This is definitely concerning   definitely, it's misinformation,' said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. 'I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.'Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn't make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.'That allows people to do more dirty tricks,' said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.'These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,' company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. 'We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.'Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as 'you can get paid to go solar.' Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for 'free' solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release '$100 million solar incentives.' He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.'It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,' Fitzpatrick said.The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address   a mailbox in Carlsbad, California   that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company   then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough   for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings.Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business. Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers. Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. 'That's how this whole process plays out.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121554235591015251764500046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT1-NMB1-JB5Y-N4BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><timeReceived>8:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those incentives don't exist.</p><p> While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p> The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected.</p><p> They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p> \"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p> Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p> Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p> The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p> \"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p> In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p> \"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p> Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p> Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint.</p><p>Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p> Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In this screenshot made from a Facebook page, a search result for \"solar energy governor\" in Facebook's Ad Archive shows ads that were falsely promising social media users that they could \"get paid to go solar.\" Hundreds of ads running on Facebook for more than a year promised that governors across the country had signed off on big tax breaks for U.S. homeowners who wanted to install new solar energy panels.
