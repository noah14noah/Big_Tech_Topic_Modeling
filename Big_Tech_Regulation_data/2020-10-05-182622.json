The duo has proposed a bill under which tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Twitter would be forced to inform users about the data they collect from the user and its exact value to an advertiser. Here's all about the legislation. Several companies sell your data to advertisers<br/>Data selling In case you don't know, tech/internet companies that don't sell anything directly to you employ your data as the product. They offer free services to collect user information and then sell that data to advertisers so that they could deliver targeted ads and promote various products/services. Facebook, Google, and Twitter are some of the companies that rely on this kind of business model. Companies hide data value and buyers, says Hawley<br/>Fact \"These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us,\" Hawley said. \"Tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\" What this bill would mean for these companies<br/>Impact Under the new bill, dubbed Dashboard Act, companies with over 100 million MAUs (monthly active users) would need to disclose every piece of information they collect to customers and regulators. </p><p>Plus, they would also be required to provide the users with an assessment of this data's value; the value would have to be given from time to time as data stock increases with usage. Prospects of the bill remain unclear<br/>Possibility As of now, there is no parallel legislation for the Dashboard Act, and there is no saying when or if it will come into force. However, the development comes just as members of the US Congress continue to root for a privacy law that would limit the control these tech companies have over user data, and give people the power to oversee their information.MENAFN2706201901650000ID1098692713</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098692713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-B8F1-JCNX-308W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Partly because we've got used to it all being free, partly because it's where the debates of the day are now publicly thrashed out. Social media is now part of our political and cultural furniture - exciting, raucous and noisy. Subsequently, we imagine it's neutral and apolitical. Empty \"platforms\" to be filled with our clamourings. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is nonsense, of course. Social media platforms are public in the same way that a shopping centre is. It looks and feels it until a security guard chucks you out for leaning over the railing, at which point you realise you're on someone else's private property. Take Facebook, with its 1.35bn monthly users. The company pays for and owns the hundreds of thousands of servers that host all of our inane content, not to mention the army of engineers and programmers required to keep the thing running. That's why Facebook allows companies to target adverts at us based on the things we post - it means we don't have to pay for it. </p><p>Then there's all the social and legal responsibilities. All social networks have terms and conditions which forbid illegal, violent, threatening or abusive stuff. These reasonable requests are frequently ignored and so Google et al need to hire hundreds of \"content managers\" whose job it is to watch humanity's bile ( according to a recent article in Wired, there are 100,000 of them, dotted around the world ) and remove it. Inevitably, this drags these usually American companies into uncomfortable decisions: should YouTube remove all Isil-related content? Should Twitter close down misogynistic accounts? Should Facebook proactively search out extremist material and pass it to the authorities, as the Intelligence and Security Committee has recently suggested? Important social questions, which are inevitably dealt with in the legal or policy department a company headquartered far away. </p><p>Because of the way the internet works, these companies also get to subtly influence what we encounter online: what we find, who we meet, and what we buy. Google's search algorithm is increasingly personalised to your own search history, which means you end up finding stuff online it thinks you want. According to one recent study, if you tell your friends on Facebook you've voted, they are more 0.39 per cent more likely to vote too. Given that Facebook could decide through its newsfeed algorithm who gets to see your declaration of civic duty - that power could affect change the result of an election. </p><p>This is not the fault of these companies, who I think err on the side of free expression, and generally want to create a free, public service. But thanks to market forces and expediency the result is a public space that isn't really controlled by the citizens. It's curated, controlled, monetised, and censored, often from behind closed doors. </p><p>A growing number of people are bothered by this. According to a new survey of 3,000 Europeans released this week, just 3 per cent of respondents said they trust social networks with their data. The European Commission has woken up, and starting taking an interest in the power of the big tech companies by threatening to break up Google, imposing the ridiculous \"right to be forgotten\", and is making noises about tougher data protection for citizens. </p><p>But technology is more typically changed by innovation than regulation. And among the hacker community an alternative way of running the internet is being built already: an internet where no one is in control, where no one can shut you down, where no one can manipulate your content. A decentralised internet. </p><p>It's not a new idea. In the early 2000s there was a burst of activity in \"peer-to-peer\" software designed so people could communicate online directly without going via some internet company. But the web became centralised, Joss Wright, a researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute explains, partly because it's easier to build centralised systems, and partly because it was such a good place to advertise. As a result the personal data revenue model took off, which permitted large companies to pay for the infrastructure and server space to create attractive and functional services, which we all joined. And social media platforms rely on the network effect - everyone is on Facebook is because everyone else is - so the result was a centralisation of people, data, then power. A natural monopoly forms. </p><p>But this latest wave could be different, because of a neat but little known new technology. Back in 2009, in an obscure cryptography chatforum, a mysterious man called Satoshi Nakamoto invented the crypto-currency Bitcoin. You've probably heard of this digital cash because it was, and still is, the currency of choice on the illegal online drugs markets which are growing in popularity. It turns out the real genius of Bitcoin was not the currency at all, but the way it decentralises everything. Bitcoin works because it creates an immutable, unchangeable public copy of every transaction ever made by its users, which is hosted and verified by every computer that downloads the software. This is called the \"block chain\". Pretty soon, enthusiasts figured out that this block chain could be used for anything. </p><p>This is the plan of a crack team of computer geeks currently trying to re-engineer the entire damn internet using the block chain. Armed with 30,000 Bitcoin (around $12 million dollars) of crowd funded support, the \" Ethereum \" project is 40 of the smartest people you'll ever meet, based mainly in Amsterdam, Berlin and London. They are currently hard at work building a new programming language and platform that uses the block chain and applies it to anything on the internet (and should be released early next year). Vinay Gupta, a member of this team, explains that the current internet is layered with several piecemeal systems which have accreted over the years: the fact so much internet traffic goes via the US is because it was invented there; the certificate system which allows secure sites to be accessed is driven by the interests of a few large commercial browser companies, and so on. The end result, he says, is a hacked together network that is inefficient, insecure, and subject to invisible political expediency and control. Ethereum is a system that its developers hope will change all that, heralding a revolution in the way we use the net - allowing us to do everything online directly with each other, not through the big companies that currently mediate our online interaction and whom we have little choice but to trust with our data. </p><p>Already others have applied this principle to all sorts of areas. One clever chap built a domain name system that cannot be removed called Namecoin; another an untraceable email system call Bitmessage. Later this month Eris Industries, a company that specialises this type of thing, is being launched in London along with lots of smart tech. Perhaps the most interesting of all is a social media platform called Twister, which is a bit like Twitter but because it uses block chain technology, everything can be done anonymously, and censorship is close to impossible. No one can shut it down, because no one owns it. Miguel Freitas, the Brazilian who spent three months building this tells me he was sparked into action when he read David Cameron say he'd considered shutting down Twitter after the 2011 riots: \"the internet alone won't help information flow if all the power is in the hands of a few people\". </p><p>Because of its ubiquity, it's easy to forget the internet has already changed shape several times. It started in the late sixties as a military project, morphed into an academic network through the eighties, was co-opted into a vehicle for commerce and business in the nineties, before being invaded by social media and user generated content which became dominated by a few large companies in the noughties. It's about to change again. If and when it does, that change will be gradual but significant: chipping away at the dominance of the big companies that currently rule the roost, and making it far harder, if not impossible, to censor and control what's online. Doubtless Isil propagandists will be rubbing their hands with this, but so will democratic revolutionaries in Russia.

Partly because we've got used to it all being free, partly because it's where the debates of the day are now publicly thrashed out. Social media is now part of our political and cultural furniture - exciting, raucous and noisy. Subsequently, we imagine it's neutral and apolitical. Empty \"platforms\" to be filled with our clamourings. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is nonsense, of course. Social media platforms are public in the same way that a shopping centre is. It looks and feels it until a security guard chucks you out for leaning over the railing, at which point you realise you're on someone else's private property. Take Facebook, with its 1.35bn monthly users. The company pays for and owns the hundreds of thousands of servers that host all of our inane content, not to mention the army of engineers and programmers required to keep the thing running. That's why Facebook allows companies to target adverts at us based on the things we post - it means we don't have to pay for it. </p><p>Then there's all the social and legal responsibilities. All social networks have terms and conditions which forbid illegal, violent, threatening or abusive stuff. These reasonable requests are frequently ignored and so Google et al need to hire hundreds of \"content managers\" whose job it is to watch humanity's bile ( according to a recent article in Wired, there are 100,000 of them, dotted around the world ) and remove it. Inevitably, this drags these usually American companies into uncomfortable decisions: should YouTube remove all Isil-related content? Should Twitter close down misogynistic accounts? Should Facebook proactively search out extremist material and pass it to the authorities, as the Intelligence and Security Committee has recently suggested? Important social questions, which are inevitably dealt with in the legal or policy department a company headquartered far away. </p><p>Because of the way the internet works, these companies also get to subtly influence what we encounter online: what we find, who we meet, and what we buy. Google's search algorithm is increasingly personalised to your own search history, which means you end up finding stuff online it thinks you want. According to one recent study, if you tell your friends on Facebook you've voted, they are more 0.39 per cent more likely to vote too. Given that Facebook could decide through its newsfeed algorithm who gets to see your declaration of civic duty - that power could affect change the result of an election. </p><p>This is not the fault of these companies, who I think err on the side of free expression, and generally want to create a free, public service. But thanks to market forces and expediency the result is a public space that isn't really controlled by the citizens. It's curated, controlled, monetised, and censored, often from behind closed doors. </p><p>A growing number of people are bothered by this. According to a new survey of 3,000 Europeans released this week, just 3 per cent of respondents said they trust social networks with their data. The European Commission has woken up, and starting taking an interest in the power of the big tech companies by threatening to break up Google, imposing the ridiculous \"right to be forgotten\", and is making noises about tougher data protection for citizens. </p><p>But technology is more typically changed by innovation than regulation. And among the hacker community an alternative way of running the internet is being built already: an internet where no one is in control, where no one can shut you down, where no one can manipulate your content. A decentralised internet. </p><p>It's not a new idea. In the early 2000s there was a burst of activity in \"peer-to-peer\" software designed so people could communicate online directly without going via some internet company. But the web became centralised, Joss Wright, a researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute explains, partly because it's easier to build centralised systems, and partly because it was such a good place to advertise. As a result the personal data revenue model took off, which permitted large companies to pay for the infrastructure and server space to create attractive and functional services, which we all joined. And social media platforms rely on the network effect - everyone is on Facebook is because everyone else is - so the result was a centralisation of people, data, then power. A natural monopoly forms. </p><p>But this latest wave could be different, because of a neat but little known new technology. Back in 2009, in an obscure cryptography chatforum, a mysterious man called Satoshi Nakamoto invented the crypto-currency Bitcoin. You've probably heard of this digital cash because it was, and still is, the currency of choice on the illegal online drugs markets which are growing in popularity. It turns out the real genius of Bitcoin was not the currency at all, but the way it decentralises everything. Bitcoin works because it creates an immutable, unchangeable public copy of every transaction ever made by its users, which is hosted and verified by every computer that downloads the software. This is called the \"block chain\". Pretty soon, enthusiasts figured out that this block chain could be used for anything. </p><p>This is the plan of a crack team of computer geeks currently trying to re-engineer the entire damn internet using the block chain. Armed with 30,000 Bitcoin (around $12 million dollars) of crowd funded support, the \" Ethereum \" project is 40 of the smartest people you'll ever meet, based mainly in Amsterdam, Berlin and London. They are currently hard at work building a new programming language and platform that uses the block chain and applies it to anything on the internet (and should be released early next year). Vinay Gupta, a member of this team, explains that the current internet is layered with several piecemeal systems which have accreted over the years: the fact so much internet traffic goes via the US is because it was invented there; the certificate system which allows secure sites to be accessed is driven by the interests of a few large commercial browser companies, and so on. The end result, he says, is a hacked together network that is inefficient, insecure, and subject to invisible political expediency and control. Ethereum is a system that its developers hope will change all that, heralding a revolution in the way we use the net - allowing us to do everything online directly with each other, not through the big companies that currently mediate our online interaction and whom we have little choice but to trust with our data. </p><p>Already others have applied this principle to all sorts of areas. One clever chap built a domain name system that cannot be removed called Namecoin; another an untraceable email system call Bitmessage. Later this month Eris Industries, a company that specialises this type of thing, is being launched in London along with lots of smart tech. Perhaps the most interesting of all is a social media platform called Twister, which is a bit like Twitter but because it uses block chain technology, everything can be done anonymously, and censorship is close to impossible. No one can shut it down, because no one owns it. Miguel Freitas, the Brazilian who spent three months building this tells me he was sparked into action when he read David Cameron say he'd considered shutting down Twitter after the 2011 riots: \"the internet alone won't help information flow if all the power is in the hands of a few people\". </p><p>Because of its ubiquity, it's easy to forget the internet has already changed shape several times. It started in the late sixties as a military project, morphed into an academic network through the eighties, was co-opted into a vehicle for commerce and business in the nineties, before being invaded by social media and user generated content which became dominated by a few large companies in the noughties. It's about to change again. If and when it does, that change will be gradual but significant: chipping away at the dominance of the big companies that currently rule the roost, and making it far harder, if not impossible, to censor and control what's online. Doubtless Isil propagandists will be rubbing their hands with this, but so will democratic revolutionaries in Russia. And for the rest of us, it will mean more control over our own data and digital footprints, a peer-to-peer network where no one is in charge - because everyone is. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-24383355</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DTC-3FS1-JCJY-G4SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1418\"/><timeReceived>4:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>December 10, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

One of the other organizations was also founded by controversial Women's March leader Linda Sarsour.[1]MoveOn.org, Demand Progress, Public Citizen, and the Open Markets Institute are four of the eight organizations that have banded together to urge the Federal Trade Commission to break up the so-called Facebook 'monopoly.'The website[2] for Freedom From Facebook begins by claiming, 'Facebook has too much power over our lives and democracy,' so '[i]t's time for us to take that power back.'Most of the organizations involved in the push have ties to Soros. MoveOn.org received its initial funding from Soros[3]. Demand Progress lists a $150,000 donation[4] from the Open Society Policy Center, which is interestingly listed as a part of the Open Society Foundations' Washington D.C. office[5] and as one of the offices of the Open Society Foundations[6]. The Public Citizen Foundation received a $450,000 grant[7] from the Open Society Foundations in 2011.A February 2018 Axios story[8] revealed the Open Society Foundations gave a $180,000 two-year grant to the Open Market Institutes the previous year in order to fight against big tech. </p><p>According to the website for the Open Markets Institute[9], Citizens Against Monopoly is one of its initiatives \u2014 which also had its endorsement on the Freedom From Facebook website. While Sum of Us does not explicitly say it is being funded by Soros, its funding page[10] lists the Open Society Foundations as one of its partners.In addition to having nearly half of the initial partner organizations associated with Soros, one of the organizations, MPower Change, lists Women's March organizer Sarsour as its team member.[11] Sarsour has drawn criticism for her association with Louis Farrakhan[12] and support for Sharia law[13]. MPower Change's 'about' page[14] states it is the 'largest Muslim led social and racial justice organization in the United States.'The coalition of groups demands the FTC to break up Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger into 'competing networks' that require users on one site to be able to communicate with the others.'Most of us use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. They're important ways for us to communicate and connect with each other. But Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power,' the website reads. 'Facebook unilaterally decides the news that billions of people around the world see every day. It buys up or bankrupts potential competitors to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice. It tracks us almost everywhere we go on the web and, through our smartphones, even where we go in the real world. It uses this intimate data hoard to figure out how to addict us and our children to its services. And then Facebook serves up everything about us to its true customers \u2014 virtually anyone willing to pay for the ability to convince us to buy, do, or believe something.''And it is spending millions on corporate lobbyists, academics, and think tanks to ensure no one gets in their way,' the campaign ironically notes, as Axios reports[15] the groups will be running a 'six figure digital ad offensive' that started on Monday.The advertisements, Axios noted, will be running on Facebook, as well as Facebook's competitors, such as Twitter.The campaign pleads for the FTC to break up Facebook in order to make it 'safe for our democracy.'Despite the draw of the campaign being that it calls Facebook a monopoly, a researcher for the Open Markets Institute, told Slate,[16] 'It's not quite for us to make the determination as to exactly what law or part of the law Facebook violated.'Facebook has disputed the idea that it is a monopoly. A representative told Axios, 'The average person uses eight different apps to communicate and stay connected.'The anti-Facebook movement also appears to span across religious divides. Jewish Voice for Peace, known for its anti-Israel activism, also signed on as one of the Freedom From Facebook partners. The organization has even been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League[17] for how it 'intentionally exploits Jewish culture and rituals to reassure its supporters that opposition to Israel does not contradict Jewish values.'The Content Creators Coalition, which lists musical artists such as Roseanne Cash, T Bone Burnett and Bette Midler on its advisory board, also signed on against Facebook.[18] In their statement on the matter, the Content Creators Coalition said they were 'proud'[19] to be a founding member of the Freedom From Facebook movement.

And then Facebook serves up everything about us to its true customers   virtually anyone willing to pay for the ability to convince us to buy, do, or believe something.''And it is spending millions on corporate lobbyists, academics, and think tanks to ensure no one gets in their way,' the campaign ironically notes, as Axios reports[15] the groups will be running a 'six figure digital ad offensive' that started on Monday.The advertisements, Axios noted, will be running on Facebook, as well as Facebook's competitors, such as Twitter.The campaign pleads for the FTC to break up Facebook in order to make it 'safe for our democracy.'Despite the draw of the campaign being that it calls Facebook a monopoly, a researcher for the Open Markets Institute, told Slate,[16] 'It's not quite for us to make the determination as to exactly what law or part of the law Facebook violated.'Facebook has disputed the idea that it is a monopoly. A representative told Axios, 'The average person uses eight different apps to communicate and stay connected.'The anti-Facebook movement also appears to span across religious divides. Jewish Voice for Peace, known for its anti-Israel activism, also signed on as one of the Freedom From Facebook partners. The organization has even been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League[17] for how it 'intentionally exploits Jewish culture and rituals to reassure its supporters that opposition to Israel does not contradict Jewish values.'The Content Creators Coalition, which lists musical artists such as Roseanne Cash, T Bone Burnett and Bette Midler on its advisory board, also signed on against Facebook.[18] In their statement on the matter, the Content Creators Coalition said they were 'proud'[19] to be a founding member of the Freedom From Facebook movement.

Nick Roditi, manager of the Quota Fund, another major fund in financier George Soros' investment group, will also leave his position, Soros Fund Management spokesman Shawn Pattison said. Pattison said the fund was not closing down. Later, Soros said he would retool Quantum as a lower-risk, less- speculative fund. He said his days of taking huge bets in global financial markets were over. \"We are bringing an epoch to an end,\" said Soros. \"The days of our large macro bets are over.\" Soros told a news conference that Quantum had enough liquidity to meet any investor redemptions. The announcement came just six weeks after another high-profile hedge fund, Tiger Management, shut down six funds after stock market losses prompted investors to pull out their money. Manager Since 1989 Druckenmiller has been a manager at the Quantum Fund since 1989, and over that time Quantum posted average annual returns in excess of 30%. But Quantum and Quota have been hammered by losses in high-technology stocks in the last few months. Quantum has lost 21.69% in value this year, and its assets under management shriveled to $ 8.25 billion in mid-April from $ 10.36 billion at the end of 1999. Quantum, which began 1999 on a sour note, scored big on a switch into high-technology stocks late in the year.</p><p>That enabled it to more than recoup earlier losses and end up 35% for the full year. But once highflying technology shares have been buffeted by extreme volatility, and major indexes have suffered severe declines that gained speed over the past month. The Nasdaq composite index is down around 25% from its all-time peak of 5,048.62 hit on March 10. Quota, which has lost 32% so far this year, has posted average annual returns since 1992 of 39%. Last year it had gains of 19%. The fund's one-time success reached a pinnacle in 1995, when its net asset value mushroomed by a whopping 159%. Comparisons To Tiger Fund The Quantum reorganization comes just weeks after Tiger Management chief Julian Robertson announced he was closing six hedge funds after two decades of running the firm. Tiger said it would return most of its $ 6 billion in assets to investors. Eighteen months ago, Tiger assets totaled $ 22 billion. But while the Soros funds were hit by losses in new economy technology shares, Robertson said he called it quits because he saw no end in sight to the bear market in stalwart value stocks - companies with unrecognized earnings potential. Referring to Robertson's decision to close his Tiger funds, Druckenmiller told Reuters in an interview in late March: \"A lot of disciplines that worked for many years have been out of fashion for the last 18 months. That does not mean they won't come back.\" Soros' Reputation Soros has often had a different style than Tiger, moving investments from stocks to bonds to currencies, depending on conditions, to take advantage of shifting markets. Soros, called \"the man who broke the pound\" after making a successful $ 10 billion bet against sterling, precipitating the currency's exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, has not seen all his big financial bets succeed in recent years. He failed to call the 1987 global stock market crash and in 1994 lost substantial funds on short-yen positions, with Quantum reportedly losing $ 600 million in one day in February 1994. Hedge funds are loosely regulated investment vehicles for wealthy individuals and institutions that sometimes use borrowings to boost the size of their financial bets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4090-0FX0-003M-X1R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>May 1, 2000</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>FUND MANAGEMENT SERVICES LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>QUANTUM FUND\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>\u00a0QUOTA FUND\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>FUND MANAGEMENT SERVICES LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0QUANTUM FUND\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>\u00a0QUOTA FUND\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N525910EE</classCode><className>HEDGE FUNDS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkY2N0Y5NDExMUY3NEE0NEJERkNDM0ZCNzIxRUU3OTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEZBNjUwRkEwQjJGNDgzQzlEMzMyNEE1RDAyOTY4RkE</classCode><className>Hedge Funds</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N523920MM</classCode><className>INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009WPV</classCode><className>GEORGE SOROS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>PE000A6Z9</classCode><className>STANLEY DRUCKENMILLER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

View original post here[2]. Via GEFIRA,[3] With his investments, Soros has become a billionaire.Unfortunately for many years he interferes in the political and demographic developments in Europe and financially supports the ethnic exchange.Now he turns against CSU, Facebook and Twitter because they endanger his leftist revolution. As every year, Soros gave his speech on the state of the world at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Play Video[4]The neo-liberal quasi-self-made orphan spoke and spoke, and the open, freedom-loving, society he invited sucked every word of his words like a sponge.Now hardly anyone noticed that Soros wants to take away their freedoms. </p><p>In the beginning, Soros talked about Russia, which he calls a mafia state that adopted nationalist ideology, and the US, which in his opinion was to become Trump under such a state.For the axis of evil, he now also counted on Hungary.Nothing new, because he always turned against the governments that try to protect their citizens from the consequences of open borders, the idea of \u200b\u200bopen society. What was new was that he scourged social networks.Since they grew into powerful monopolies, according to Soros, they are supposed to influence our behavior and consciousness (especially in elections) too much.'They deceive their users by manipulating their attention, targeting them to their own economic interests and () depending on their services () The platforms are similar to gambling companies () and force people to renounce their freedom (). ), to renounce what John Stuart Mill called the freedom of thought 'Is that why Facebook and Twitter are blocked in countries like China, Afghanistan, North Korea?Thanks to the Internet ban, can people think freely and leave their opinions open to all?No, Soros is not about our freedom of expression, it is about us being able to defend ourselves against his manipulations, against the propaganda of his NGO network on these communication platforms.The frontal assault Soros sounds all the more hypocritical than he has stocks of big-tech companies worth $ 113 million.That's peanuts compared to $ 14 billion he spent over the last 30 years manipulating and destabilizing in many countries, especially in eastern and central Europe, to install open societies. Soros continues to announce a war:'It's only a matter of time before the global dominance of US IT monopolists is broken.Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered.' This should be followed by regulations and taxation. Taxation, because Soros gets on the nerves that we can spread our free thoughts for free.Here he mentioned EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager as an example of how to proceed. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/2018-02-13_19-37-36.jpg?itok=YaeFUyIY\">https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/2018-02-13_19-37-36.jpg?itok=YaeFUyIY</url> The boss of the antitrust authority kicked Google on the feet and imposed the search engine group for the control of the market for product search 2,424,495,000 euros fine.In 2016, she said,'We believe that Google's behavior has harmed consumers because they only get the results Google wanted;but not the mostrelevantones. ' If you use the keyword'EU criticism' Googling for a while, then the search results and the content of the websites that they can access in this way are certainly not relevant for the European Commission, they are dangerous for them.The next bang she missed the I-Phone manufacturer Apple - the verdict?13 billion euro tax refund.Vestager is thus an important domino in the trade war between Europe and the USA.It is also a puzzle in the cultural battle on the Internet between the two continents.She will also play a crucial role as the EU's most powerful woman - she is the chief investigator, prosecutor and judge in one responsible for monopolies, mergers, cartels and state aid - in the private (?) Soros war against freedom of expression.No wonder then:The question arises: is Vestager adequately controlled by the European Parliament?Soros called in Davos a danger that American tech companies allegedly bring with it:Neither Huxley nor Orwell also never dreamt that in the age of the most advanced democracies, a private network of NGOs within sovereign states will lead and harm their hostile policies - Soros financially supports NGOs that smuggle migrants to Italy on an industrial scale. Finally, a quote from our savior:The ruler of the 'free thinking' is now facing a difficult fight against the treacherous American big-tech corporations that want to conquer Europe, against the nationalist Russian mafiosi, against the worthless Polish national-minded politicians who defend their right to self-determination within the EU, against which builds a closed society Trump Republicans, against Orban's Hungarian nationalist insurgents, these defiant fence-makers.Hopefully he will lose his dominant position in this fight.

George Soros has been a vigorous critic of Big Tech surveillance and lambasted Google and Facebook last year at Davos. This year, he returned to this theme and highlighted China's wide ranging domestic spying powers and some of its disturbing tools, like its social score. Soros depicted China's AI ambitions as a planned assault on individual freedom. </p><p>Even more remarkably, backed the Trump administration plans to take on China and encouraged it to go further, specifically by competing with China's Belt and Road program. A cognitive bias is the halo effect, the tendency to see people as all good or all bad. Even if you deplore Soros' adventurism in Ukraine, Soros also kept public universities across Eastern Europe from collapsing when the USSR broke up. Soros has become vocal about the dangers of surveillance and particularly the use of AI and machine learning to greatly increase their effectiveness. If you are as old as I am, you may recall that one of the reason the West felt so threatened by the USSR was that it had industrialized in a generation, a stunning accomplishment. The West was alarmed that a command and control society could mobilize resources more effectively than a lassiez faire economy. Soros gives a 21st century version of the fear that authoritarian societies can use surveillance technology to control and direct their populations. Soros singles out China as far and away the biggest threat. From his speech:China isn't the only authoritarian regime in the world, but it's undoubtedly the wealthiest, strongest and most developed in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society. How can open societies be protected if these new technologies give authoritarian regimes a built-in advantage? That's the question that preoccupies me. And it should also preoccupy all those who prefer to live in an open society.Wired give a good recap[1]:China's government issued a broad AI strategy in 2017, asserting that it would surpass US prowess in the technology by 2030. As in the US, much of the leading work on AI in China takes place inside a handful of large tech companies, such as search engine Baidu and retailer and payments company Alibaba. Soros argued that AI-centric tech companies like those can become enablers of authoritarianism. He pointed to China's developing 'social credit' system, aimed at tracking citizens' reputations by logging financial activity, online interactions, and even energy use, among other things. The system is still taking shape, but depends on data and cooperation from companies like payments firm Ant Financial, a spinout of Alibaba. 'The social credit system, if it became operational, would give Xi Jinping total control over the people,' Soros said. Soros argued that synergy like that between corporate and government AI projects creates a more potent threat than was posed by Cold War-era autocrats, many of whom spurned corporate innovation. 'The combination of repressive regimes with IT monopolies endows those regimes with a built-in advantage over open societies,' Soros said. 'They pose a mortal threat to open societies.'Having said that, it's not hard to see why one can wonder about Soros's 'open society' when he describes how, in the 1980s, he chose and backed scholars whose views he liked. Social engineering by a foreignerpretty fraught. In what may come as a surprise, Soros backs Trump's efforts to contain China and urges him to do more:Most importantly, the US government has now identified China as a 'strategic rival.' President Trump is notoriously unpredictable, but this decision was the result of a carefully prepared plan. Since then, the idiosyncratic behavior of Trump has been largely superseded by a China policy adopted by the agencies of the administration and overseen by Asian affairs advisor of the National Security Council Matt Pottinger and others. The policy was outlined in a seminal speech by Vice President Mike Pence on October 4th. Last year I still believed that China ought to be more deeply embedded in the institutions of global governance, but since then Xi Jinping's behavior has changed my opinion. My present view is that instead of waging a trade war with practically the whole world, the US should focus on China. Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly, it needs to crack down on them. If these companies came to dominate the 5G market, they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world.Soros also contends, giving specific examples, that China's Belt and Road program has been funding projects with loans rather than grants, that bribery is common to get the projects approved, and they are often uneconomic, putting China in a position to squeeze the borrower. As the Financial Times noted[2]:An outspoken critic of US president Donald Trump and a bogeyman for populist leaders around the world, Mr Soros said the Trump administration had developed 'a coherent policy' towards China. Mr Trump was notoriously unpredictable, he declared, but the US government had rightly identified China as a strategic rival. He called for an American response to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which he said was designed to promote the interests of Beijing rather than those of recipient countries. He singled out China's actions in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Pakistan.Now to the full text of Soros's remarks:* * *I want to use my time tonight to warn the world about an unprecedented danger that's threatening the very survival of open societies. Last year when I stood before you I spent most of my time analyzing the nefarious role of the IT monopolies. This is what I said: 'An alliance is emerging between authoritarian states and the large data rich IT monopolies that bring together nascent systems of corporate surveillance with an already developing system of state sponsored surveillance. This may well result in a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even George Orwell could have imagined.' Tonight I want to call attention to the mortal danger facing open societies from the instruments of control that machine learning and artificial intelligence can put in the hands of repressive regimes. I'll focus on China, where Xi Jinping wants a one-party state to reign supreme. A lot of things have happened since last year and I've learned a lot about the shape that totalitarian control is going to take in China. All the rapidly expanding information available about a person is going to be consolidated in a centralized database to create a 'social credit system.' Based on that data, people will be evaluated by algorithms that will determine whether they pose a threat to the one-party state. People will then be treated accordingly. The social credit system is not yet fully operational, but it's clear where it's heading. It will subordinate the fate of the individual to the interests of the one-party state in ways unprecedented in history. I find the social credit system frightening and abhorrent. Unfortunately, some Chinese find it rather attractive because it provides information and services that aren't currently available and can also protect law-abiding citizens against enemies of the state. China isn't the only authoritarian regime in the world, but it's undoubtedly the wealthiest, strongest and most developed in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society. But Xi isn't alone. Authoritarian regimes are proliferating all over the world and if they succeed, they will become totalitarian. As the founder of the Open Society Foundations, I've devoted my life to fighting totalizing, extremist ideologies, which falsely claim that the ends justify the means. I believe that the desire of people for freedom can't be repressed forever. But I also recognize that open societies are profoundly endangered at present. What I find particularly disturbing is that the instruments of control developed by artificial intelligence give an inherent advantage to authoritarian regimes over open societies. For them, instruments of control provide a useful tool; for open societies, they pose a mortal threat. I use 'open society' as shorthand for a society in which the rule of law prevails as opposed to rule by a single individual and where the role of the state is to protect human rights and individual freedom. In my personal view, an open society should pay special attention to those who suffer from discrimination or social exclusion and those who can't defend themselves. By contrast, authoritarian regimes use whatever instruments of control they possess to maintain themselves in power at the expense of those whom they exploit and suppress. How can open societies be protected if these new technologies give authoritarian regimes a built-in advantage? That's the question that preoccupies me. And it should also preoccupy all those who prefer to live in an open society. Open societies need to regulate companies that produce instruments of control, while authoritarian regimes can declare them 'national champions.' That's what has enabled some Chinese state-owned companies to catch up with and even surpass the multinational giants. This, of course, isn't the only problem that should concern us today. For instance, man-made climate change threatens the very survival of our civilization. But the structural disadvantage that confronts open societies is a problem which has preoccupied me and I'd like to share with you my ideas on how to deal with it. My deep concern for this issue arises out of my personal history. I was born in Hungary in 1930 and I'm Jewish. I was 13 years old when the Nazis occupied Hungary and started deporting Jews to extermination camps. I was very fortunate because my father understood the nature of the Nazi regime and arranged false identity papers and hiding places for all members of his family, and for a number of other Jews as well. Most of us survived. The year 1944 was the formative experience of my life. I learned at an early age how important it is what kind of political regime prevails. When the Nazi regime was replaced by Soviet occupation I left Hungary as soon as I could and found refuge in England. At the London School of Economics I developed my conceptual framework under the influence of my mentor, Karl Popper. That framework proved to be unexpectedly useful when I found myself a job in the financial markets. The framework had nothing to do with finance, but it is based on critical thinking. This allowed me to analyze the deficiencies of the prevailing theories guiding institutional investors. I became a successful hedge fund manager and I prided myself on being the best paid critic in the world. Running a hedge fund was very stressful. When I had made more money than I needed for myself or my family, I underwent a kind of midlife crisis. Why should I kill myself to make more money? I reflected long and hard on what I really cared about and in 1979 I set up the Open Society Fund. I defined its objectives as helping to open up closed societies, reducing the deficiencies of open societies and promoting critical thinking. My first efforts were directed at undermining the apartheid system in South Africa. Then I turned my attention to opening up the Soviet system. I set up a joint venture with the Hungarian Academy of Science, which was under Communist control, but its representatives secretly sympathized with my efforts. This arrangement succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. I got hooked on what I like to call 'political philanthropy.' That was in 1984. In the years that followed, I tried to replicate my success in Hungary and in other Communist countries. I did rather well in the Soviet empire, including the Soviet Union itself, but in China it was a different story. My first effort in China looked rather promising. It involved an exchange of visits between Hungarian economists who were greatly admired in the Communist world, and a team from a newly established Chinese think tank which was eager to learn from the Hungarians. Based on that initial success, I proposed to Chen Yizi, the leader of the think tank, to replicate the Hungarian model in China. Chen obtained the support of Premier Zhao Ziyang and his reform-minded policy secretary Bao Tong. A joint venture called the China Fund was inaugurated in October 1986. It was an institution unlike any other in China. On paper, it had complete autonomy. Bao Tong was its champion. But the opponents of radical reforms, who were numerous, banded together to attack him. They claimed that I was a CIA agent and asked the internal security agency to investigate. To protect himself, Zhao Ziyang replaced Chen Yizi with a high-ranking official in the external security police. The two organizations were co-equal and they couldn't interfere in each other's affairs. I approved this change because I was annoyed with Chen Yizi for awarding too many grants to members of his own institute and I was unaware of the political infighting behind the scenes. But applicants to the China Fund soon noticed that the organization had come under the control of the political police and started to stay away. Nobody had the courage to explain to me the reason for it. Eventually, a Chinese grantee visited me in New York and told me, at considerable risk to himself. Soon thereafter, Zhao Ziyang was removed from power and I used that excuse to close the foundation. This happened just before the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and it left a 'black spot' on the record of the people associated with the foundation. They went to great length to clear their names and eventually they succeeded. In retrospect, it's clear that I made a mistake in trying to establish a foundation which operated in ways that were alien to people in China. At that time, giving a grant created a sense of mutual obligation between the donor and recipient and obliged both of them to remain loyal to each other forever. So much for history. Let me now turn to the events that occurred in the last year, some of which surprised me. When I first started going to China, I met many people in positions of power who were fervent believers in the principles of open society. In their youth they had been deported to the countryside to be re-educated, often suffering hardships far greater than mine in Hungary. But they survived and we had much in common. We had all been on the receiving end of a dictatorship. They were eager to learn about Karl Popper's thoughts on the open society. While they found the concept very appealing, their interpretation remained somewhat different from mine. They were familiar with Confucian tradition, but there was no tradition of voting in China. Their thinking remained hierarchical and carried a built-in respect for high office. I, on the other hand I was more egalitarian and wanted everyone to have a vote. So, I wasn't surprised when Xi Jinping ran into serious opposition at home; but I was surprised by the form it took. At last summer's leadership convocation at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, Xi Jinping was apparently taken down a peg or two. Although there was no official communique, rumor had it that the convocation disapproved of the abolition of term limits and the cult of personality that Xi had built around himself. It's important to realize that such criticisms were only a warning to Xi about his excesses, but did not reverse the lifting of the two-term limit. Moreover, 'The Thought of Xi Jinping,' which he promoted as his distillation of Communist theory was elevated to the same level as the 'Thought of Chairman Mao.' So Xi remains the supreme leader, possibly for lifetime. The ultimate outcome of the current political infighting remains unresolved. I've been concentrating on China, but open societies have many more enemies, Putin's Russia foremost among them. And the most dangerous scenario is when these enemies conspire with, and learn from, each other on how to better oppress their people. The question poses itself, what can we do to stop them? The first step is to recognize the danger. That's why I'm speaking out tonight. But now comes the difficult part. Those of us who want to preserve the open society must work together and form an effective alliance. We have a task that can't be left to governments. History has shown that even governments that want to protect individual freedom have many other interests and they also give precedence to the freedom of their own citizens over the freedom of the individual as a general principle. My Open Society Foundations are dedicated to protecting human rights, especially for those who don't have a government defending them. When we started four decades ago there were many governments which supported our efforts but their ranks have thinned out. The US and Europe were our strongest allies, but now they're preoccupied with their own problems. Therefore, I want to focus on what I consider the most important question for open societies: what will happen in China? The question can be answered only by the Chinese people. All we can do is to draw a sharp distinction between them and Xi Jinping. Since Xi has declared his hostility to open society, the Chinese people remain our main source of hope. And there are, in fact, grounds for hope. As some China experts have explained to me, there is a Confucian tradition, according to which advisors of the emperor are expected to speak out when they strongly disagree with one of his actions or decrees, even that may result in exile or execution. This came as a great relief to me when I had been on the verge of despair. The committed defenders of open society in China, who are around my age, have mostly retired and their places have been taken by younger people who are dependent on Xi Jinping for promotion. But a new political elite has emerged that is willing to uphold the Confucian tradition. This means that Xi will continue to have a political opposition at home. Xi presents China as a role model for other countries to emulate, but he's facing criticism not only at home but also abroad. His Belt and Road Initiative has been in operation long enough to reveal its deficiencies. It was designed to promote the interests of China, not the interests of the recipient countries; its ambitious infrastructure projects were mainly financed by loans, not by grants, and foreign officials were often bribed to accept them. Many of these projects proved to be uneconomic. The iconic case is in Sri Lanka. China built a port that serves its strategic interests. It failed to attract sufficient commercial traffic to service the debt and enabled China to take possession of the port. There are several similar cases elsewhere and they're causing widespread resentment. Malaysia is leading the pushback. The previous government headed by Najib Razak sold out to China but in May 2018 Razak was voted out of office by a coalition led by Mahathir Mohamed. Mahathir immediately stopped several big infrastructure projects and is currently negotiating with China how much compensation Malaysia will still have to pay. The situation is not as clear-cut in Pakistan, which has been the largest recipient of Chinese investments. The Pakistani army is fully beholden to China but the position of Imran Khan who became prime minister last August is more ambivalent. At the beginning of 2018, China and Pakistan announced grandiose plans in military cooperation. By the end of the year, Pakistan was in a deep financial crisis. But one thing became evident: China intends to use the Belt and Road Initiative for military purposes as well. All these setbacks have forced Xi Jinping to modify his attitude toward the Belt and Road Initiative. In September, he announced that 'vanity projects' will be shunned in favor of more carefully conceived initiatives and in October, the People's Daily warned that projects should serve the interests of the recipient countries. Customers are now forewarned and several of them, ranging from Sierra Leone to Ecuador, are questioning or renegotiating projects. Most importantly, the US government has now identified China as a 'strategic rival.' President Trump is notoriously unpredictable, but this decision was the result of a carefully prepared plan. Since then, the idiosyncratic behavior of Trump has been largely superseded by a China policy adopted by the agencies of the administration and overseen by Asian affairs advisor of the National Security Council Matt Pottinger and others. The policy was outlined in a seminal speech by Vice President Mike Pence on October 4th. Even so, declaring China a strategic rival is too simplistic. China is an important global actor. An effective policy towards China can't be reduced to a slogan. It needs to be far more sophisticated, detailed and practical; and it must include an American economic response to the Belt and Road Initiative. The Pottinger plan doesn't answer the question whether its ultimate goal is to level the playing field or to disengage from China altogether. Xi Jinping fully understood the threat that the new US policy posed for his leadership. He gambled on a personal meeting with President Trump at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires. In the meantime, the danger of global trade war escalated and the stock market embarked on a serious sell-off in December. This created problems for Trump who had concentrated all his efforts on the 2018 midterm elections. When Trump and Xi met, both sides were eager for a deal. No wonder that they reached one, but it's very inconclusive: a ninety-day truce. In the meantime, there are clear indications that a broad based economic decline is in the making in China, which is affecting the rest of the world. A global slowdown is the last thing the market wants to see. The unspoken social contract in China is built on steadily rising living standards. If the decline in the Chinese economy and stock market is severe enough, this social contract may be undermined and even the business community may turn against Xi Jinping. Such a downturn could also sound the death knell of the Belt and Road Initiative, because Xi may run out of resources to continue financing so many lossmaking investments. On the question of global internet governance, there's an undeclared struggle between the West and China. China wants to dictate rules and procedures that govern the digital economy by dominating the developing world with its new platforms and technologies. This is a threat to the freedom of the Internet and indirectly open society itself. Last year I still believed that China ought to be more deeply embedded in the institutions of global governance, but since then Xi Jinping's behavior has changed my opinion. My present view is that instead of waging a trade war with practically the whole world, the US should focus on China. Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly, it needs to crack down on them. If these companies came to dominate the 5G market, they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world. Regrettably, President Trump seems to be following a different course: make concessions to China and declare victory while renewing his attacks on US allies. This is liable to undermine the US policy objective of curbing China's abuses and excesses. To conclude, let me summarize the message I'm delivering tonight. My key point is that the combination of repressive regimes with IT monopolies endows those regimes with a built-in advantage over open societies. The instruments of control are useful tools in the hands of authoritarian regimes, but they pose a mortal threat to open societies. China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced. This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies. That's why it's so important to distinguish Xi Jinping's policies from the aspirations of the Chinese people. The social credit system, if it became operational, would give Xi total control over the people. Since Xi is the most dangerous enemy of the open society, we must pin our hopes on the Chinese people, and especially on the business community and a political elite willing to uphold the Confucian tradition. This doesn't mean that those of us who believe in the open society should remain passive. The reality is that we are in a Cold War that threatens to turn into a hot one. On the other hand, if Xi and Trump were no longer in power, an opportunity would present itself to develop greater cooperation between the two cyber-superpowers. It is possible to dream of something similar to the United Nations Treaty that arose out of the Second World War. This would be the appropriate ending to the current cycle of conflict between the US and China. It would reestablish international cooperation and allow open societies to flourish. That sums up my message.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/01/soros-warns-against-ai-promoted-surveillance-and-authoritarianism-singles-out-chinas-existing-tools-and-ambitions.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/01/soros-warns-against-ai-promoted-surveillance-and-authoritarianism-singles-out-chinas-existing-tools-and-ambitions.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in China[3], Politics[4], Social policy[5], Surveillance state[6], Technology and innovation[7] on January 25, 2019[8] by Yves Smith[9].

It is the property of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. People on both sides of the political aisle seem to have forgotten this crucial fact. They also seem to have forgotten that the First Amendment does not guarantee you a right to say whatever you want, whenever you want. It only promises that your speech will not be either limited or compelled by government. In short, it is a protection from government, not a right over fellow citizens.</p><p><br/>That's why YouTube's newly announced policies on which videos will be allowed on its platform should be supported by free speech advocates. The company is exercising its own speech rights: its right to not provide a platform for certain speech they find to violate their principles. In that sense, it's no different than you choosing not to host a fundraising barbecue in your backyard for a cause with which you disagree. What the company is not doing is preventing anyone from making a video about anything.<br/>With the recent news about potential antitrust investigations surrounding big tech companies, some may argue that YouTube, and thus Alphabet/Google's size means they are under different obligations. Nope.<br/>There is no size caveat in the First Amendment.<br/>When Blockbuster was the largest video rental company in the market, it was under no obligation to carry every video ever made. Nor are television stations and cable providers obligated to air every show or carry every channel. Consider even major bookstore chains such as Barnes &amp; Noble. Are they under any obligation to carry any and all published material? Of course not.<br/>Yet there is a concerning trend in tech policy where different expectations are placed on large companies simply because they are products of the internet age.<br/>Too many people seem to like First Amendment protections only when it benefits views they agree with and oppose such protections when it comes to views with which they disagree. Conservatives were vehement about the rights of Masterpiece Cakeshop, where a baker refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. The political Left saw this as discrimination and sought to compel bakers to make cakes under those circumstances, while the political Right saw the case as a violation of the baker's religious protections under the First Amendment. But now, suddenly, the Right clamors for regulation of tech platforms for real and imagined curtailing of conservative voices, while the Left has lurched from seeking forced speech to seeking to coerce tech platforms to silence protected speech (believing tech platforms have a duty to stem the spread of racism, anti-Semitism, and other hateful content).<br/>Here's the legal reality: The Supreme Court decisively sided with the baker in a 7-2 decision, meaning even some of the perceived left-leaning judges joined the decision. A different standard cannot apply to YouTube simply because its business is in providing a video-hosting and an advertising platform, rather than baking cakes.<br/>Internet businesses should not be held to different standards than other industries. Candlemakers and lightbulb manufacturers didn't (and don't) have different rights and criteria. That would not make sense. Plus, it would create another big problem. If we hold businesses to different standards of rights-protections based on the technology that facilitates their business, we risk dramatically curbing entrepreneurship and technological innovation.<br/>The recent rumblings about the Trump administration's potential antitrust investigations into companies like Alphabet should be alarming. There is no doubt these efforts are fueled by the perception that the platforms are biased against the political right in various ways. Yet, conservatives and others on the Right ought to consider the ramifications of arbitrarily applying speech protections. We should all want robust competition among tech companies, to offer consumers an improving, evolving, life-enhancing online experience. We shouldn't want would-be entrepreneurs to fear their constitutional protections will be blown away by political winds as well.<br/>Originally published at the Washington Examiner.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Patrick HedgerDate:\u00a0Thursday, June 6, 2019Source:\u00a0Washington ExaminerIssues:\u00a0Law and ConstitutionSearch Keywords:\u00a0ConstitutionMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0It may be called YouTube, but that doesn't mean it belongs to you.

A short-term tax break on investment was offset with a new tax on big digital companies. It was pitched as a way to bring the tax system up to date with the digital economy, but an extra tax does not sound like the work of a man who is \"revitalising capitalism\".</p><p>Here are a series of ideas that could free up the digital economy, revitalise capitalism and, crucially for the Chancellor, cost the taxpayer very little.</p><p>Super-charge fintech Luigi Zingales, professor of entrepreneurship and finance at Chicago Booth, believes more competitive regulation would let the UK seize a key role in the emerging financial technology industry.</p><p>\"The UK is sufficiently [experienced] in the financial industry. It is in quite a unique position to take advantage of being a small player with credibility,\" he says.</p><p>This could be particularly crucial once the UK has left the EU. \"With Brexit it may be more difficult for the UK to do financial business the traditional way, so [we may see] a push to do it the fintech way, where location becomes less of an issue,\" Zingales says.</p><p>\"It is a huge opportunity, if it is exploited well.\" This means ensuring regulation that allows markets to thrive. \"Fintech is an industry without barriers but the United States, paradoxically, has not shown such open-mindedness,\" he says.</p><p>More broadly, Zingales fears a lack of competition is the key problem facing the modern economy. Consumers often end up paying higher prices than they would in a truly free market.</p><p>The professor says it is too soon to know to what extent digital technologies contribute to this problem, given it is a young industry that often offers services without charge. If there are dangerous monopolies, it is tricky to work out how to inject competition.</p><p>Take control of data The 20th-century solution of breaking up monopolies may not help here; digital giants work well because of network effects, which make scale valuable to consumers, and because it is relatively cheap to serve billions of customers digitally.</p><p>In any case, the UK is going to struggle to break up American tech giants. Instead, Zingales says data ownership is key.</p><p>\"Who owns the data, and can we think of reallocating it? Europe is at the vanguard in this with Open Banking: your transactions with your banks? You own it. You change banks? You can give an order to transfer that to your new bank,\" he says.</p><p>\"That changes the competitive dynamic dramatically, and that is very important.\"</p><p>This is something the UK could reinforce \"to stimulate competition\".</p><p>\"Between the law and the practice there is a lot. One thing Hammond could look at very carefully is how easy it is to make that data portable,\" says Zingales.</p><p>Break open traditional industries On the other hand, regulations may also be preventing big tech firms from entering traditional markets, again to consumers' detriment.</p><p>Prof Colin Mayer, a fellow at the British Academy, sees digital technologies reshaping industries rapidly, with regulation failing to keep up. He also uses financial services as an example.</p><p>\"The whole nature of the market is changing and it makes regulation based on the institutional form of banks no longer appropriate - you have to think in terms of their function, so these new entrants will perform similar functions to existing banks,\" he says. Observe \"the way in which Amazon has moved into groceries; it has essentially transformed the nature of the players within that market\".</p><p>\"The same thing will happen in banking,\" Mayer adds. If the rules are not changed, the digital revolution will be held back. \"What is going on is creative destruction, but regulation risks destroying the creation,\" he says.</p><p>Shake up education An alternative idea is to update the education system. Better education helped power economic growth in the 19th and 20th centuries, and modernising the curriculum to teach more digital skills could help unleash growth again today.</p><p>Dom Hallas, of the Coalition for a Digital Economy, suggests the Government could put private coding schools \"on to a more formal footing\".</p><p>\"I would suggest this means some kind of accreditation for the coding schools that would allow them to tap into government funding, and let students use the normal student loan system just like at universities and more. This would recognise and leverage the success of our privatesector coding schools by bringing them into the formal education system,\" he says.</p><p>\"There would also be opportunities for government to fund these schools to run courses at discounted rates in places where there is a clear skills need but where the market wouldn't support it - leveraging the data government holds on skills gaps.\"</p><p>Sign up for your daily technology update <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk\">www.telegraph.co.uk</url>/ technewsletter</p><p>'The UK is in quite a unique position to take advantage of being a small player with credibility'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has claimed to be 'reinvigorating capitalism for the digital age' - but is he on the right track to free up the digital economy or does he need to be more ambitious?ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/GETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-143385288</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNX-8YX1-JCBW-N2CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 8, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

A diplomatic source telling CNN it's clear the top North Korean officials involved in the failed February summit with President Trump in Hanoi have disappeared, but it is not yet known whether they were executed or imprisoned by Kim Jong-un as reported in a South Korean newspaper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As CNN's Michelle Kosinski now reports, one of the North Koreans who has gone missing met with President Trump in D.C. last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveling in Europe today had very little to say on the explosive reporting out of South Korea that five of North Korea's negotiators with the United States have now been executed following the failed Hanoi summit with President Trump back in February.</p><p>[16:35:07] MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We're going our best to check it out. I don't have anything else to add to that today.</p><p>KOSINSKI: According to a newspaper, \"Chosun Ilbo\", citing an unnamed North Korean source, top diplomat, Kim Hyok-chol the North Korean envoy to U.S. negotiations, was executed in an airfield, along with four other working level diplomats. The newspaper says they were charged with being recruited by American imperialists and betraying the supreme leader.</p><p>Pompeo's counterpart, the former spy chief, tough negotiator, Kim Yong-chol, seen here in the Oval Office with President Trump and Kim Hyok-chol last year, was allegedly sent to a labor camp. Even the interpreter, according to this report, has been imprisoned for making a mistake.</p><p>CNN has not independently been able to verify this reporting. South Korean reports of North Korean executions have at times been inaccurate. But when rumors started to surface about possible executions earlier this month, Pompeo was asked about it on ABC.</p><p>POMPEO: It does appear that the next time we have serious conversations that my counterpart will be someone else.</p><p>KOSINSKI: One senior diplomatic source familiar with U.S./North Korea negotiations says the two top officials, at least, have certainly disappeared. But there's not any independent intelligence or information at this point on what exactly has happened to them.</p><p>The White House saying only this.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I am not going to comment on intelligence one way or another. I can tell you, we're monitoring the situation and continuing to stay focused on our ultimate goal, which is denuclearization.</p><p>KOSINSKI: But executions are part of Leader Kim Jong-un's style. Human rights advocates have reported witnesses say he's had people killed by flame thrower, wild dogs, and shredded with powerful anti- aircraft guns. The U.S. believes Kim murdered his own uncle and his half brother.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KOSINSKI: One senior diplomatic source tells us that Kim Jong-un did seem to be flustered and furious with his own team after Hanoi fell apart, even though there was no guarantee there was going to be any deal there. Remember, going into this summit, there was not even any agreed upon definition of denuclearization -- Jake.</p><p>TAPPER: High stakes.</p><p>Michelle Kosinski at the State Department, thanks so much.</p><p>More than a dozen 2020 candidates are going west to Senator Kamala Harris' own backyard, but there is one key name missing from the list.

It does serve a broader purpose. It is a delegate-rich state that will have a big impact on the outcome of who becomes the nominee.</p><p>LAH: But Wicks and the Harris camp say they're not taking home field advantage for granted.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, Joe Biden have all been campaigning in the state.</p><p>But the field's front-runner isn't heading to crowded California this weekend. Biden will be in Ohio instead, staking his own lane.</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Now please welcome, Senator Michael Bennet.</p><p>LAH: Biden's more pragmatic path is one Michael Bennet aimed to bite into at the CNN town hall, swiping a Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-All plan.</p><p>SEN.

So, Jake, the convention starts in heft tomorrow.</p><p>TAPPER: All right. Kyung Lah in San Francisco, thanks so much.</p><p>I want to start with some reporting from CNN's KFILE Team. President Trump has been in recent days quite critical of former Vice President Biden for steering the 1994 crime bill to make it become law. However, in Trump's book from the year 2000, \"The America We Deserve,\" the now president took positions that supported similar measures, tougher sentencing, street policing.</p><p>[16:45:00]</p><p>He wrote, quote: A government study of crime in America warns that when the population of adolescent males rises early next century, we're going to have wolf packs roaming the streets and not only downtown if these kids are anything like those who terrorized urban America in recent years or in for a very bad time.</p><p>Toluse, let me start with you. I mean, can President Trump really attack Biden on this issue with any credibility?</p><p>TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He's going to try to. I think it's a big part of the President's strategy going into 2020 is to find issues where Democrats have some dissension, where there's some differences between the candidates and really dig in and try to sort of throw bombs from outside the primary and see whether or not he can shake up some of these candidates.</p><p>Specifically, Joe Biden has been the one that he's been focusing mostly on. And I think he realized in 2016 he had some success sort of hitting Hillary Clinton from the left on issues like criminal justice, taking her on over the so-called superpredator comment and they're going to try to use that strategy again and try to make sure that any progressives that may be thinking about voting for Joe Biden who see him as the most electable candidate may have second thoughts based on the President's own commentary and also on the President's record.</p><p>He's going to be touting his first step back and his proposal for a criminal justice reform and trying to use that to put some distance between specifically progressive voters, African-American voters, and Joe Biden who President Trump and his campaign see as the front-runner right now.</p><p>TAPPER: But let me ask you, Robby. Do you think it's about winning votes or do you think it's about suppressing black turnout has happened in 2016.</p><p>ROBBY MOOK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You're hitting the nail on the head. He's not trying to win anybody over, he's claiming that. He's claiming that but he's not. Because 2016 is a great example. He would -- he would cast aspersions on Hillary Clinton who by the way never voted for that crime bill. You know, her husband was the president but you know, she never cast a vote for it.</p><p>TAPPER: Right.</p><p>MOOK: But then at the same time at his rallies, he'd say there's crime in the streets, we've got to get control of crime. He made racist comments all the time. This is not a man who wants to win African-American votes. This is --</p><p>TAPPER: Hold on. Let him finish.</p><p>MOOK: He made racist statements constantly during the campaign. This is not about winning those votes, it's about getting people to stay home and feel disenchanted with the Democrats.</p><p>TAPPER: You disagree with that?</p><p>DAVID URBAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So first of all, I took -- we did -- we did round tables in the city of Philadelphia with African- American community leaders, ministers. We weren't doing that to suppress the vote, we were doing it to hear what they had to say, what folks had to say in the inner cities to get votes not to suppress votes.</p><p>Number two, the first step act is a seriously great step lauded by everybody, the far right and the far left. The President took on a lot of water. This president took a lot of water from his base and from others, had to twist arms on Capitol Hill, McConnell and others to pass the first step act.</p><p>That's not something you do if you're trying to suppress African- American votes, that's something you do to try to reach out to African-Americans.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to -- I want to turn to another candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who stopped by The Breakfast Club and talked to the Charlamagne tha God. Hey had a very long conversation and in it he said a lot of very nice things about her and all the plans she has, proposals. But there was one very buzzy moment that isn't one that I'm sure she liked. Let's run that clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, RADIO HOST: He's kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit. Rachel Dolezal, a white woman pretending to be black.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): This is what I learned from my family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: Just to remind you, if you don't remember, Rachel Dolezal was this woman who I said she identified as black but she was born white. She later called herself transracial. This is an issue that a lot of voters don't seem to really care about according to our reporters and other reporters, but it is one the comes up in the media and obviously by President Trump.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And Republicans have seized on it to use it as a sticking point to criticize Elizabeth Warren and they've had success branding her as that making that one thing about her even though she tried to get ahead of it by releasing that test. But it's something that President himself is used to try -- he picks one thing of each candidate and tries to seize on that. And we've seen it and expect that --</p><p>URBAN: She lacks authenticity.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, everyone, stick around. We have some news, good news if you're an abortion rights supporter especially in Missouri, but the celebration might not last very long. Stay with us.</p><p>[16:50:00] TAPPER: In our \"NATIONAL LEAD,\" a judge in Missouri has ruled to keep the last legal abortion clinic in the state open for now. The license was set to expire today. CNN's Alexandra Field joins me now from St. Louis. And Alexandra, what does this ruling mean for that Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis long term?</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's really just a temporary victory, Jake. It means they can continue to perform abortions but potentially just for a few more days, at least until the case goes before a judge again next week.</p><p>Right now, Planned Parenthood is essentially saying that the state didn't renew their licenses essentially part of a war on abortion. They say the state is basically trying to regulate abortion out of existence and that the licensing process has become politicized.</p><p>The state says no, they didn't renew the license for the abortion clinic because of health violations and an ongoing investigation. But the stakes are big here because this is the only abortion clinic in the entire state of Missouri. And this is a state that is now staring down the barrel of being the only state in the country not to provide access to abortion for women for the first time in more than 40 years.</p><p>Missouri is one of just six states that has just one abortion clinic. So, Jake, you've got to believe that people in those other five states will be watching closely to see if Missouri loses access to abortion not by changing a law but through regulation.</p><p>TAPPER: Although the state did also just sign -- the governor signed a law that would essentially ban almost all abortions. Alexandra Field, thank you so much. Coming up, a member of the House Judiciary Committee weighs in on the breaking news. Stick around.</p><p>[16:55:00] TAPPER: Tune to CNN this Sunday morning for \"STATE OF THE UNION.\" My guest includes Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan. We'll talk about the border and the President's new threat of tariffs. We'll talk to House Majority Whip Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina about impeachment and the Democrat's agenda.

But the introduction of fintech, writes Mushtak Parker, is putting the country's banking giants on notice to improve efficiency and customer service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The news on the economic front may be disappointing, tempered with frustration. After all, the latest gross domestic product (GDP) growth results released by the National Treasury in Pretoria on 4 September showed that the South African economy contracted, by -0.7% in real terms in the Second Quarter (Q2) 2018, confirming that the country had 'entered a technical recession' for the first time since 2009.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GDP of course measures the value of economic activity within a country and is the sum of the market values, or prices, of all final goods and services produced in the economy during a period of time. The main difference between nominal and real GDP is that the latter is adjusted for differences in prices levels and therefore inflation.</p><p>This is on the back of an even bigger contraction in Q1 2018, when the economy shrank by -2.6%, with the dubious redemption that at least the rate of contraction has slowed down. Not surprisingly, both credit extension by banks and GDP growth trajectory have taken a hammering. According to First National Bank (FNB), credit extension in July slowed to 5.4% from 5.7% a month earlier.</p><p>The National Treasury earlier this year forecast a GDP growth rate of 1.5% for 2018 but nine months into the year, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, to his credit, could not stop himself from issuing an official health warning for the South African economy.</p><p>\"The outlook for the economy remains fragile,\" he said. \"The contraction in GDP growth in Q2 2018 and the downward revision to the first quarter data pose significant downside risks. Subdued business confidence, weak activity in the supply-side of the economy and various headwinds to household spending will hinder a robust recovery in growth.</p><p>\"South Africa's growth trajectory is too low to meet the needs of our people, in particular youth unemployment, which remains too high at 55%. To make a significant dent on the unemployment rate, which currently stands slightly above 27%, our economy will have to grow at 5% or more.\"</p><p>According to Moody's Investors Service, one of the top three international credit rating agencies, amid weak consumer spending, and emerging market currencies' volatility precipitated by the US tariff action against Turkey and hence the contagion effect of the depressed Turkish lira, and inflationary pressures, South African economic growth will remain weak.</p><p>Moody's forecast real GDP growth of just 0.7%-1% in 2018, rising to 1.5% in 2019, from 1.3% in 2017 \u2013 lower than the government's budget growth forecast of 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.</p><p>Yet the good Minister Nene may be pleasantly surprised that despite the statistics of doom and gloom, the outlook for the South African economy for the next year or two, especially the banking sector, is not as dire as the data suggests, of course with some caveats.</p><p>\"We have changed our outlook for the South African banking system to stable from negative, reflecting our assessment that the banks' financial metrics and creditworthiness will remain resilient over the next 12 to 18 months, despite weakening operating conditions. Slow economic growth will hold back the banks' new business and revenues,\" explained Nondas Nicolaides, Vice President &amp; Senior Credit Officer at Moody's, to African Banker.</p><p>This resilience is borne out by the interim results of two of the largest banks in South Africa, Standard Bank and FNB, part of the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) Group.</p><p>Against the backdrop of a tough economy including a recent increase in VAT, FNB's balance sheet indicators for the first half of 2018 have all increased by healthy figures, in several instances by double digits.</p><p>Profit before tax in the domestic franchise, for instance, grew 16%, with retail and commercial banking profits increasing by 18%. Customer deposits also increased with the bank now providing services to 8.15m customers.</p><p>This confidence even extended to providing unsecured facilities to the small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which increased to R17bn ($1.19bn), up 13% at end June 2018 compared to the same period last year.</p><p>Jacques Celliers, chief executive officer of FNB, in an official statement, attributed this resilience and 'excellent results' largely to the bank's digital strategy.</p><p>\"Our digital journey, particularly FNB App usage, again showed excellent growth with financial transactions up 65%,\" he said. \"We were also delighted with progress in digital fulfillment where significant strides were made on both onboarding and leveraging cross-sell opportunities, and the bank will continue to invest in future technology projects.\"</p><p>Fighting talk</p><p>The scenario for Standard Bank was the same with Group earnings up by 5% to R12.7bn for FH 2018, led by personal and business banking and corporate and investment banking. Similarly, return on equity increased to 16.8%, well on course for the 2018 annual target of 18-20%.</p><p>Not surprisingly, there was equally fighting talk from Sim Tshabalala, Standard Bank Group CEO, who is seeking to protect and grow the bank's franchise both at home and in Africa per se.</p><p>\"In South Africa, while consumer confidence has improved, delays in resolving key policy issues remain an obstacle to business confidence, fixed investment and growth. Inflation is expected to remain inside the 3% to 6% target range, supporting a flat interest rate outlook for the rest of the year,\" he said.</p><p>\"The Group has the appetite to grow lending judiciously in South Africa. There is no doubt competitive pressures will continue to increase, however, we will fiercely protect our existing customer franchise and grow by partnering with third parties to build new, innovative offerings and revenue streams,\" explained Tshabalala.</p><p>Moody's Nondas Nicolaides expects South African banks' credit risk profile and problem loans to remain broadly stable to the end of 2019. Impaired loans stood at 3.5% of gross loans system-wide in June 2018.</p><p>The news on the capital adequacy front is also good. According to him, \"South African banks report solid capital metrics, well above regulatory minima, and our central scenario is that capital buffers will remain resilient and protected by profits. The average common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.8% as of June 2018, with a Basel III leverage ratio of 6.6%.</p><p>\"Funding and liquidity conditions will be stable. Institutional short-term deposits are an important source of funding for South African banks, and this will make meeting Basel III's net stable funding ratio (NSFR) next year a challenge. However, banks have built good liquidity buffers in recent years, while limited use of foreign-currency funding also supports their funding profiles,\" he added.</p><p>However, profitability will be strained by slow business growth and higher costs. Banks' revenues will be pressured by subdued business opportunities and increased operating expenses.</p><p>Net interest income, according to Moody's, is likely to come under modest pressure because of lower loan growth, while increased staff and digitalisation costs will create a drag on net profitability. The rating agency expects banks' return on assets in 2018-19 to be marginally lower than the 1.4% reported in June 2018.</p><p>The country's and bank's fortunes will also be affected by the ability of South Africa to attract inward foreign direct investment (FDI), albeit China's planned massive investment in Africa of up to $6bn over the next few years, especially in South Africa, should be an exception given the special partnership Chinese state-owned ICBC, the world's largest bank in terms of assets, has with Standard Bank through its 20% acquisition in the latter.</p><p>$100bn FDI drive</p><p>With an alarming decline in the total inward FDI, the country has embarked on an ambitious global roadshow to whip up support for a record $100bn FDI drive (see following story).</p><p>But investor concerns over the potential impact of the government's proposed expropriation without compensation (EWC) initiative are hindering progress.</p><p>\"Uncertainty with regards to the EWC,\" stressed Moody's Nicolaides, \"is something that undermines investor confidence and defers any new investments, especially in the agricultural sector.</p><p>\"In addition, it depresses asset valuations and accordingly increases potential losses for banks in case a borrower defaults. We believe that this will be managed in a way that it will not compromise banks' exposure to the agricultural sector and will not create any black holes on banks' balance sheets.\"</p><p>He is not duly concerned by the bank's exposure to state- owned enterprises (SOEs) and other sectors, including infrastructure financing, when during the Zuma presidency banks went on \"a financing strike\" because of the perceived effects of the government's economic</p><p>management.</p><p>\"Banks in South Africa at the moment are still quite cautious in their lending to SOEs, still usually requiring a government guarantee against any new exposure. This will likely continue to be the case until these SOEs are fully revamped operationally and become self- sufficient and viable entities,\" he added.</p><p>Fintech game-changer</p><p>The introduction of the Twin Peaks regulatory regime together with the reputation of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) provides a welcome overhaul of the regulatory framework, which the general consensus maintains will contribute to financial stability and effective management of any troubled banks.</p><p>Digitisation through fintech, however, could prove to be a greater game changer in the coming years. The widening application of digital innovations in financial services, according to Moody's, is placing a premium on efficiency and opening up banking services to competition from financial technology firms (fintechs). This is driving disruption in the South African banking sector and in banking globally.</p><p>\"In South Africa, digital innovation will drive disintermediation, with technological advances also threatening banks in the payments space,\" explains Nicolaides.</p><p>\"Incumbent South African banks will also face competition from digital-only (internet &amp; mobile) challenger banks and fintech firms intent on capturing an ever-increasing share of customers' online activity, online spending and internet data. These include Discovery Bank, Bank Zero and Tyme Digital,\" he adds.</p><p>The large South African banks have an advantage over their smaller peers because of their scale and resources, as well as the attractiveness of their nationwide footprint for fintech and big tech partnerships.</p><p>Banks that have the resources and strategic vision to develop or acquire innovative products and processes and integrate new technology into their business models will be most successful in defending their customer relationships.</p><p>According to Nicolaides, many South African banks are focusing on achieving this through partnerships with fintechs to enhance their mobile banking capabilities, enhance online account-opening functionality and automate credit decisions for online consumer loan applications.</p><p>New technology, to him, can also increase efficiency through the reduction of large branch networks and call centres, the upgrading of legacy IT systems and automation of internal processes, although this requires high initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs.</p><p>In February 2018, SARB launched a fintech programme, a starting point for the central bank to experiment with digital technologies, establish a regulatory framework for virtual currencies and assess the appropriateness of innovation facilitators.</p><p>\"The adoption of fintech infrastructure and regulation following these assessments, which are scheduled to conclude in 2018, will improve efficiency, strengthen anti-money laundering practices and increase South African technologies' competitiveness globally,\" says Moody's.</p><p>Of the three primary objectives outlined by the SARB, the most pioneering is the experimentation with distributed ledger technologies, whose adoption can improve efficiencies in back- and middle-office functions.</p><p>The cost-to-income ratio of South African banks is higher than that of BRICS peers, with the improvements in the ratio in recent years also trailing peers.

This is distracting it from the unfinished business of redressing inequality and creating the preconditions for an inclusive digital economy and society. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reinvented by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab\">Klaus Schwab</url> of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/\">World Economic Forum</url> (WEF), 4IR technologies are presented as having the potential to propel digitally-ready countries into a new age of unprecedented economic prosperity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Forum's appropriation of the concept has arguably been one the most successful lobbying and policy influence instruments of our time. Mobilising around the elite annual gathering in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/\">Davos</url>, the WEF policy blueprints on the 4IR fill a vacuum for many countries that haven't publicly invested in what they want their own futures to look like. South Africa is one of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With visions of global prosperity, packaged with futurist conviction and fantastical economic forecasts of exponential growth and job creation, they appear to provide a ready roadmap in an uncertain future.</p><p>But caution is required. Even a cursory glance at earlier industrial revolutions will show that they have not been associated with the interests of the working or underclasses. This is despite the broader benefits to society from the introduction of steam, electricity and digitisation. Rather, they are associated with the advancement of capitalism, through the \"big\" tech of the day. </p><p>The so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution is no different. </p><h>Rich school of thought</h><p>There is little to link the WEF's reductionist conception of industrial development with the rich school of thought that has examined complex and revolutionary change over time. The intellectual origins of the subject lie with Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kondratiev. In 1926, he identified waves and shifts in capitalism as it matured over time. This became known as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/kondratieff-wave/\">Kondratiev Wave</url>. It was popularised intellectually by the Austrian political economist Joseph Schumpeter's notion of \"creative destruction\". </p><p>That concept now underpins much of the contemporary theory on innovation. It also informs thinking about disruption as a potentially positive economic and social force. So far, six  Kondratiev waves are identified in the literature. Information and communication technologies is the fifth. Renewable energy is proposed as the sixth.</p><p>Yet this intellectual tradition has been ignored by the WEF. In addition, a range of institutions have responded to its clarion call. These include Ivy League universities, international industry conferences, <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.itu.int/fourth-industrial-revolution-production/\">multilateral agencies</url>, development banks and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inonafrica.com/2019/06/24/the-4th-industrial-revolution-in-africa-the-next-great-frontier/\">regional economic commissions</url>. </p><p>At the same time international donor agencies and governments are diverting public funding from pro-poor policy research agendas on digital inclusion to artificial intelligence as well as robotics, machine learning, drones and blockchain. This, on a continent where Internet penetration in many countries is <url normalizedValue=\"https://researchictafrica.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_After-Access_Africa-Comparative-report.pdf\">below the critical mass 20%</url> believed to be necessary to enjoy the network effects associated with broadband adoption and economic growth. </p><p>In South Africa, the 4IR has become the mantra of every new policy initiative and official event. President Cyril Ramaphosa has thrown his weight behind it as the route out of the economic crisis. His proposed vehicle for pursuing it is a new presidential <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/press-statements/president-appoints-commission-fourth-industrial-revolution\">commission</url>.</p><h>The limits of technology</h><p>The notion of a 4IR might be a convenient way of packaging history and of mobilising people. But there is nothing inherent in so-called 4IR technologies that will necessarily result in economic growth, job creation or empowerment of the marginalised. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/Events/2019/05/20190522t1830vOT/Where-Will-Future-Jobs-and-Growth-Come-From\">Evidence</url> from the so-called third IR tells us we should not take for granted that technology will translate into wage or productivity growth. Nor will it necessarily generate \"decent work\". Countries must first develop a good set of complementary policies, both as business and government, to reap the benefits of these increasingly pervasive advanced technologies.</p><p>The conflation of broad digital policy required to support social and economic transformation with this narrower aspect of the deployment and governance of the data associated with '4IR' technologies is problematic. In fact, layering these advanced technologies over the existing structural inequality in South Africa will exacerbate existing social, economic and political inequalities. </p><p>It is not that advanced technologies cannot be mobilised for developmental purposes. But technology, in and of itself, cannot change or disrupt existing modes of production. It also cannot determine positive or negative outcomes. The interests that mobilise behind or drive certain innovations, and the uses to which the resulting technologies are put determine their social, economic and political outcomes.</p><p>Several South African government departments have developed WEF-inspired 4IR strategies. The most recent example is the 4IR framing report released by the recently re-merged Department of Communications.</p><p>Accenture, the international consultancy that partners with the WEF globally on the 4IR, has prepared <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accenture.com/t20180201t173907z__w__/za-en/_acnmedia/pdf-70/accenture-creating-south-africa-future-workforce.pdfla=en\">a framework</url> for the Department. This, it says, will enable South Africa to become 4IR-ready.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report perpetuates some of the myths of the 4IR. It claims that 4IR technologies across industries in South Africa can, over the next decade, contribute R5 trillion worth of social and economic value. It also claims that they will create 4 million jobs. </p><p>The report says these are based on the methodology developed by the WEF in collaboration with Accenture. But there is no explanation of the methodology; no basic workings on how these figures were derived.</p><h>Here's a quick reality check</h><p>South Africa has about 700 000 new young people entering the job market every year. The Centre for Economic Development and Transformation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/news/ramaphosas-big-jobs-headache-as-outlook-remains-bleak-26405877\">estimates</url> that a growth rate of around 10% will be required to absorb these new entrants into the economy. But the current growth is only expected to reach 1.5% in 2019. It is then expected to rise to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.treasury.gov.za/documents/national%20budget/2019/review/Chapter%202.pdf\">2.1% by 2021</url></p><p>With the Accenture copyright emblazoned on the report, it has now been  released as a government document. With a nod to digital inclusion the report does observe that to make this miracle happen, South Africa will need to meet several conditions. These include improved connectivity, effective regulation and functioning markets. </p><p>Optimised consumer welfare, redressing poor education outcomes, and developing an appropriate digital skills base for the new economy will all be crucial too. All undoubtedly correct, but this is no revelation. These are all objectives of current policy that South Africa has failed to achieve to different degrees over the past 25 years.</p><p>The report makes no effort to explain why the outcome of two decades of policy reform and sector regulation has failed to maximise consumer welfare - its primary objective. Instead the sector is characterised by rent extraction. This has been by both the private sector (high prices) and the state (licence fees and secondary sectoral taxes that contribute to the high prices).</p><p>Like other reports from the slick international consultants over the years, they fail to engage with a host of critical inhibitors of digital inclusion and diffusion of advanced technologies beyond an elite. It does not ask why previous rounds of market reform weren't successfully implemented. There is no reference to the the absence of institutional endowments necessary to implement so called international \"best practice\" in most African countries. </p><p>Addressing the reasons for policy and institutional failures and proposing how these might be overcome would have gone some way to laying the ground for South Africa to more equitably embrace the impending \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Gillwald is executive director of Research ICT Africa (RIA) and Adjunct Professor at the University of Cape Town's Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance.

Shutterstock  Courtesy ofAlison Gillwald[1], University of Cape Town[2] South Africa is caught up in the global hype of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This is distracting it from the unfinished business of redressing inequality and creating the preconditions for an inclusive digital economy and society. Reinvented by Klaus Schwab[3] of the World Economic Forum[4] (WEF), 4IR technologies are presented as having the potential to propel digitally-ready countries into a new age of unprecedented economic prosperity. The Forum's appropriation of the concept has arguably been one the most successful lobbying and policy influence instruments of our time. </p><p>Mobilising around the elite annual gathering in Davos[5], the WEF policy blueprints on the 4IR fill a vacuum for many countries that haven't publicly invested in what they want their own futures to look like. South Africa is one of them. With visions of global prosperity, packaged with futurist conviction and fantastical economic forecasts of exponential growth and job creation, they appear to provide a ready roadmap in an uncertain future. But caution is required. Even a cursory glance at earlier industrial revolutions will show that they have not been associated with the interests of the working or underclasses. This is despite the broader benefits to society from the introduction of steam, electricity and digitisation. Rather, they are associated with the advancement of capitalism, through the 'big' tech of the day. The so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution is no different. Rich school of thought There is little to link the WEF's reductionist conception of industrial development with the rich school of thought that has examined complex and revolutionary change over time. The intellectual origins of the subject lie with Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kondratiev. In 1926, he identified waves and shifts in capitalism as it matured over time. This became known as the Kondratiev Wave[6]. It was popularised intellectually by the Austrian political economist Joseph Schumpeter's notion of 'creative destruction'. That concept now underpins much of the contemporary theory on innovation. It also informs thinking about disruption as a potentially positive economic and social force. So far, six Kondratiev waves are identified in the literature. Information and communication technologies is the fifth. Renewable energy is proposed as the sixth. Yet this intellectual tradition has been ignored by the WEF. In addition, a range of institutions have responded to its clarion call. These include Ivy League universities, international industry conferences, multilateral agencies[7], development banks and regional economic commissions[8]. At the same time international donor agencies and governments are diverting public funding from pro-poor policy research agendas on digital inclusion to artificial intelligence as well as robotics, machine learning, drones and blockchain. This, on a continent where Internet penetration in many countries is below the critical mass 20%[9] believed to be necessary to enjoy the network effects associated with broadband adoption and economic growth. In South Africa, the 4IR has become the mantra of every new policy initiative and official event. President Cyril Ramaphosa has thrown his weight behind it as the route out of the economic crisis. His proposed vehicle for pursuing it is a new presidential commission[10]. The limits of technology The notion of a 4IR might be a convenient way of packaging history and of mobilising people. But there is nothing inherent in so-called 4IR technologies that will necessarily result in economic growth, job creation or empowerment of the marginalised. Evidence[11] from the so-called third IR tells us we should not take for granted that technology will translate into wage or productivity growth. Nor will it necessarily generate 'decent work'. Countries must first develop a good set of complementary policies, both as business and government, to reap the benefits of these increasingly pervasive advanced technologies. The conflation of broad digital policy required to support social and economic transformation with this narrower aspect of the deployment and governance of the data associated with '4IR' technologies is problematic. In fact, layering these advanced technologies over the existing structural inequality in South Africa will exacerbate existing social, economic and political inequalities. It is not that advanced technologies cannot be mobilised for developmental purposes. But technology, in and of itself, cannot change or disrupt existing modes of production. It also cannot determine positive or negative outcomes. The interests that mobilise behind or drive certain innovations, and the uses to which the resulting technologies are put determine their social, economic and political outcomes. Several South African government departments have developed WEF-inspired 4IR strategies. The most recent example is the 4IR framing report released by the recently re-merged Department of Communications. Accenture, the international consultancy that partners with the WEF globally on the 4IR, has prepared a framework[12] for the Department. This, it says, will enable South Africa to become 4IR-ready. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report perpetuates some of the myths of the 4IR. It claims that 4IR technologies across industries in South Africa can, over the next decade, contribute R5 trillion worth of social and economic value. It also claims that they will create 4 million jobs. The report says these are based on the methodology developed by the WEF in collaboration with Accenture. But there is no explanation of the methodology; no basic workings on how these figures were derived. Here's a quick reality check South Africa has about 700 000 new young people entering the job market every year. The Centre for Economic Development and Transformation estimates[13] that a growth rate of around 10% will be required to absorb these new entrants into the economy. But the current growth is only expected to reach 1.5% in 2019. It is then expected to rise to 2.1% by 2021[14] With the Accenture copyright emblazoned on the report, it has now been released as a government document. With a nod to digital inclusion the report does observe that to make this miracle happen, South Africa will need to meet several conditions. These include improved connectivity, effective regulation and functioning markets. Optimised consumer welfare, redressing poor education outcomes, and developing an appropriate digital skills base for the new economy will all be crucial too. All undoubtedly correct, but this is no revelation. These are all objectives of current policy that South Africa has failed to achieve to different degrees over the past 25 years. The report makes no effort to explain why the outcome of two decades of policy reform and sector regulation has failed to maximise consumer welfare - its primary objective. Instead the sector is characterised by rent extraction. This has been by both the private sector (high prices) and the state (licence fees and secondary sectoral taxes that contribute to the high prices). Like other reports from the slick international consultants over the years, they fail to engage with a host of critical inhibitors of digital inclusion and diffusion of advanced technologies beyond an elite. It does not ask why previous rounds of market reform weren't successfully implemented. There is no reference to the the absence of institutional endowments necessary to implement so called international 'best practice' in most African countries. Addressing the reasons for policy and institutional failures and proposing how these might be overcome would have gone some way to laying the ground for South Africa to more equitably embrace the impending 'Fourth Industrial Revolution'.

This is distracting it from the unfinished business of redressing inequality and creating the preconditions for an inclusive digital economy and society. Reinvented byKlaus Schwabof theWorld Economic Forum(WEF), 4IR technologies are presented as having the potential to propel digitally-ready countries into a new age of unprecedented economic prosperity.The Forum's appropriation of the concept has arguably been one the most successful lobbying and policy influence instruments of our time. Mobilising around the elite annual gathering inDavos , the WEF policy blueprints on the 4IR fill a vacuum for many countries that haven't publicly invested in what they want their own futures to look like. South Africa is one of them.With visions of global prosperity, packaged with futurist conviction and fantastical economic forecasts of exponential growth and job creation, they appear to provide a ready roadmap in an uncertain future.But caution is required. Even a cursory glance at earlier industrial revolutions will show that they have not been associated with the interests of the working or underclasses. This is despite the broader benefits to society from the introduction of steam, electricity and digitisation. Rather, they are associated with the advancement of capitalism, through the 'big' tech of the day. The so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution is no different.</p><p><br/>Rich school of thoughtThere is little to link the WEF's reductionist conception of industrial development with the rich school of thought that has examined complex and revolutionary change over time. The intellectual origins of the subject lie with Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kondratiev. In 1926, he identified waves and shifts in capitalism as it matured over time. This became known as theKondratiev Wave . It was popularised intellectually by the Austrian political economist Joseph Schumpeter's notion of 'creative destruction'. That concept now underpins much of the contemporary theory on innovation. It also informs thinking about disruption as a potentially positive economic and social force. So far, sixKondratiev waves are identified in the literature. Information and communication technologies is the fifth. Renewable energy is proposed as the sixth.Yet this intellectual tradition has been ignored by the WEF. In addition, a range of institutions have responded to its clarion call. These include Ivy League universities, international industry conferences,multilateral agencies , development banks andregional economic commissions . At the same time international donor agencies and governments are diverting public funding from pro-poor policy research agendas on digital inclusion to artificial intelligence as well as robotics, machine learning, drones and blockchain. This, on a continent where Internet penetration in many countries isbelow the critical mass 20%believed to be necessary to enjoy the network effects associated with broadband adoption and economic growth. In South Africa, the 4IR has become the mantra of every new policy initiative and official event. President Cyril Ramaphosa has thrown his weight behind it as the route out of the economic crisis. His proposed vehicle for pursuing it is a new presidentialcommission .<br/>The limits of technologyThe notion of a 4IR might be a convenient way of packaging history and of mobilising people. But there is nothing inherent in so-called 4IR technologies that will necessarily result in economic growth, job creation or empowerment of the marginalised. Evidencefrom the so-called third IR tells us we should not take for granted that technology will translate into wage or productivity growth. Nor will it necessarily generate 'decent work'. Countries must first develop a good set of complementary policies, both as business and government, to reap the benefits of these increasingly pervasive advanced technologies.The conflation of broad digital policy required to support social and economic transformation with this narrower aspect of the deployment and governance of the data associated with '4IR' technologies is problematic. In fact, layering these advanced technologies over the existing structural inequality in South Africa will exacerbate existing social, economic and political inequalities. It is not that advanced technologies cannot be mobilised for developmental purposes. But technology, in and of itself, cannot change or disrupt existing modes of production. It also cannot determine positive or negative outcomes. The interests that mobilise behind or drive certain innovations, and the uses to which the resulting technologies are put determine their social, economic and political outcomes.Several South African government departments have developed WEF-inspired 4IR strategies. The most recent example is the 4IR framing report released by the recently re-merged Department of Communications.Accenture, the international consultancy that partners with the WEF globally on the 4IR, has prepareda frameworkfor the Department. This, it says, will enable South Africa to become 4IR-ready.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report perpetuates some of the myths of the 4IR. It claims that 4IR technologies across industries in South Africa can, over the next decade, contribute R5 trillion worth of social and economic value. It also claims that they will create 4 million jobs. The report says these are based on the methodology developed by the WEF in collaboration with Accenture. But there is no explanation of the methodology; no basic workings on how these figures were derived.<br/>Here's a quick reality checkSouth Africa has about 700 000 new young people entering the job market every year. The Centre for Economic Development and Transformationestimatesthat a growth rate of around 10% will be required to absorb these new entrants into the economy. But the current growth is only expected to reach 1.5% in 2019. It is then expected to rise to2.1% by 2021 With the Accenture copyright emblazoned on the report, it has now beenreleased as a government document. With a nod to digital inclusion the report does observe that to make this miracle happen, South Africa will need to meet several conditions. These include improved connectivity, effective regulation and functioning markets. Optimised consumer welfare, redressing poor education outcomes, and developing an appropriate digital skills base for the new economy will all be crucial too. All undoubtedly correct, but this is no revelation. These are all objectives of current policy that South Africa has failed to achieve to different degrees over the past 25 years.The report makes no effort to explain why the outcome of two decades of policy reform and sector regulation has failed to maximise consumer welfare - its primary objective. Instead the sector is characterised by rent extraction. This has been by both the private sector (high prices) and the state (licence fees and secondary sectoral taxes that contribute to the high prices).Like other reports from the slick international consultants over the years, they fail to engage with a host of critical inhibitors of digital inclusion and diffusion of advanced technologies beyond an elite. It does not ask why previous rounds of market reform weren't successfully implemented. There is no reference to the the absence of institutional endowments necessary to implement so called international 'best practice' in most African countries. Addressing the reasons for policy and institutional failures and proposing how these might be overcome would have gone some way to laying the ground for South Africa to more equitably embrace the impending 'Fourth Industrial Revolution'.<br/>Industrial Development Klaus Schwab Fourth industrial revolution technological innovation<br/><br/>MENAFN2008201901990000ID1098905179</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098905179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVW-DNC1-F04Y-T3XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp;

This is distracting it from the unfinished business of redressing inequality and creating the preconditions for an inclusive digital economy and society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reinvented by Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum (WEF), 4IR technologies are presented as having the potential to propel digitally-ready countries into a new age of unprecedented economic prosperity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Forum's appropriation of the concept has arguably been one the most successful lobbying and policy influence instruments of our time. Mobilising around the elite annual gathering in Davos, the WEF policy blueprints on the 4IR fill a vacuum for many countries that haven't publicly invested in what they want their own futures to look like. South Africa is one of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With visions of global prosperity, packaged with futurist conviction and fantastical economic forecasts of exponential growth and job creation, they appear to provide a ready roadmap in an uncertain future.</p><p>But caution is required. Even a cursory glance at earlier industrial revolutions will show that they have not been associated with the interests of the working or underclasses. This is despite the broader benefits to society from the introduction of steam, electricity and digitisation. Rather, they are associated with the advancement of capitalism, through the \"big\" tech of the day.</p><p>The so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution is no different.</p><h>Rich school of thought</h><p>There is little to link the WEF's reductionist conception of industrial development with the rich school of thought that has examined complex and revolutionary change over time. The intellectual origins of the subject lie with Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kondratiev. In 1926, he identified waves and shifts in capitalism as it matured over time. This became known as the Kondratiev Wave. It was popularised intellectually by the Austrian political economist Joseph Schumpeter's notion of \"creative destruction\".</p><p>That concept now underpins much of the contemporary theory on innovation. It also informs thinking about disruption as a potentially positive economic and social force. So far, six Kondratiev waves are identified in the literature. Information and communication technologies is the fifth. Renewable energy is proposed as the sixth.</p><p>Yet this intellectual tradition has been ignored by the WEF. In addition, a range of institutions have responded to its clarion call. These include Ivy League universities, international industry conferences, multilateral agencies, development banks and regional economic commissions.</p><p>At the same time international donor agencies and governments are diverting public funding from pro-poor policy research agendas on digital inclusion to artificial intelligence as well as robotics, machine learning, drones and blockchain. This, on a continent where Internet penetration in many countries is below the critical mass 20% believed to be necessary to enjoy the network effects associated with broadband adoption and economic growth.</p><p>In South Africa, the 4IR has become the mantra of every new policy initiative and official event. President Cyril Ramaphosa has thrown his weight behind it as the route out of the economic crisis. His proposed vehicle for pursuing it is a new presidential commission.</p><h>The limits of technology</h><p>The notion of a 4IR might be a convenient way of packaging history and of mobilising people. But there is nothing inherent in so-called 4IR technologies that will necessarily result in economic growth, job creation or empowerment of the marginalised.</p><p>Evidence from the so-called third IR tells us we should not take for granted that technology will translate into wage or productivity growth. Nor will it necessarily generate \"decent work\". Countries must first develop a good set of complementary policies, both as business and government, to reap the benefits of these increasingly pervasive advanced technologies.</p><p>The conflation of broad digital policy required to support social and economic transformation with this narrower aspect of the deployment and governance of the data associated with '4IR' technologies is problematic. In fact, layering these advanced technologies over the existing structural inequality in South Africa will exacerbate existing social, economic and political inequalities.</p><p>It is not that advanced technologies cannot be mobilised for developmental purposes. But technology, in and of itself, cannot change or disrupt existing modes of production. It also cannot determine positive or negative outcomes. The interests that mobilise behind or drive certain innovations, and the uses to which the resulting technologies are put determine their social, economic and political outcomes.</p><p>Several South African government departments have developed WEF-inspired 4IR strategies. The most recent example is the 4IR framing report released by the recently re-merged Department of Communications.</p><p>Accenture, the international consultancy that partners with the WEF globally on the 4IR, has prepared a framework for the Department. This, it says, will enable South Africa to become 4IR-ready.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report perpetuates some of the myths of the 4IR. It claims that 4IR technologies across industries in South Africa can, over the next decade, contribute R5 trillion worth of social and economic value. It also claims that they will create 4 million jobs.</p><p>The report says these are based on the methodology developed by the WEF in collaboration with Accenture. But there is no explanation of the methodology; no basic workings on how these figures were derived.</p><h>Here's a quick reality check</h><p>South Africa has about 700 000 new young people entering the job market every year. The Centre for Economic Development and Transformation estimates that a growth rate of around 10% will be required to absorb these new entrants into the economy. But the current growth is only expected to reach 1.5% in 2019. It is then expected to rise to 2.1% by 2021</p><p>With the Accenture copyright emblazoned on the report, it has now been released as a government document. With a nod to digital inclusion the report does observe that to make this miracle happen, South Africa will need to meet several conditions. These include improved connectivity, effective regulation and functioning markets.</p><p>Optimised consumer welfare, redressing poor education outcomes, and developing an appropriate digital skills base for the new economy will all be crucial too. All undoubtedly correct, but this is no revelation. These are all objectives of current policy that South Africa has failed to achieve to different degrees over the past 25 years.</p><p>The report makes no effort to explain why the outcome of two decades of policy reform and sector regulation has failed to maximise consumer welfare - its primary objective. Instead the sector is characterised by rent extraction. This has been by both the private sector (high prices) and the state (licence fees and secondary sectoral taxes that contribute to the high prices).</p><p>Like other reports from the slick international consultants over the years, they fail to engage with a host of critical inhibitors of digital inclusion and diffusion of advanced technologies beyond an elite. It does not ask why previous rounds of market reform weren't successfully implemented. There is no reference to the the absence of institutional endowments necessary to implement so called international \"best practice\" in most African countries.</p><p>Addressing the reasons for policy and institutional failures and proposing how these might be overcome would have gone some way to laying the ground for South Africa to more equitably embrace the impending \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\".</p><p>Alison Gillwald, Adjunct Professor, Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance, University of Cape Town</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRWEB-201908210104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRWEB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVX-Y8G1-DY15-S02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">361904</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Distributed by AllAfrica Global Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ICT and Telecom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy, Business and Finance</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Indonesia is already preparing legislation requiring tech companies with online services to pay value-added tax on local sales, even when they are booked offshore.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thailand's telecom regulator, in a late-August meeting with regional counterparts, proposed that all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) require internet and streaming video firms to set up domestic \"verification centers\" to combat fake news.</p><p>Thailand also urged discussion of how to demand \"economic contributions\" from the internet firms, whether through taxes or fees, according to a copy of a speech seen by Reuters.</p><p>The council of ASEAN telecoms regulators has accepted Thailand's proposal for the centers, and a separate document with guidelines for economic contribution is expected to be formally adopted at the November ASEAN summit, a source in the Thai regulatory agency with knowledge of the talks told Reuters.</p><p>\"ASEAN as a group gives us enough leverage, and our combined user base on services like Facebook is big enough to lend us negotiating power,\" the source said.</p><p>The initiatives reflect widespread concern that Internet services, to which most people in the region have gained access only in the past few years, are fanning ethnic and religious animosities while avoiding paying their fair share.</p><p>Activist groups are nervous about the potential for institutionalized censorship. According to Freedom House's 2018 Net Freedom survey, all Southeast Asian countries rank as either not free or partly free.</p><p>Emilie Pradichit, director of Thailand-based Manushya Foundation, which advocates for online rights, told Reuters governments in the region could use the label \"fake news\" to target dissidents. She called on companies to resist such attempts.</p><p>\"We believe the governments should themselves not use untrue information to achieve goals that are to their advantage, and private sector organizations, such as Facebook, should take the lead in protecting netizens' online freedom,\" Pradichit told Reuters.</p><p>The Asia Internet Coalition, which counts internet giants Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter and messaging app Line among its members, said ASEAN risks hurting the digital economy unless the new policies are \"right.\"</p><p>\"The potential of the region's digital economy ... will likely be blunted by overregulation or indiscriminate taxes and fees,\" AIC director Jeff Paine told Reuters, urging governments to focus on \"industry partnerships and collaborations.\"</p><p>CONSENSUS DISPUTED</p><p>It is not yet clear what level of support the new proposals enjoy and how they might be implemented in coming months.</p><p>Indonesia's plan follows its successful effort to get Alphabet Inc's Google to pay taxes on Indonesia-related advertising revenue booked at its Asia headquarters in Singapore.</p><p>\"Other countries asked me how we were able to achieve that, so I offered to them that they piggyback off Indonesia to deal with the platforms,\" Rudiantara said. He said he also persuaded social media giants Telegram and Tik-Tok to establish content monitoring teams in Indonesia.</p><p>Rudiantara is now planning a \"three letter system\" in which if a platform fails to respond to three government requests to engage on an issue, he'll ban them. The proposal to neighboring countries includes a shared channel to communicate with the companies.</p><p>The Thai regulator wants to require internet companies to set up and fund \"verification centers\" in each Southeast Asian country.</p><p>Singapore has already passed a complex \"fake news\" law requiring internet companies to label or remove content deemed untrue.</p><p>The Thai proposal aims to ensure that companies take quick action on fake news and fake accounts. Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube all have elaborate policies on what is allowed on their platforms and generally ban fake accounts, deceptive practices and hate speech. Content that is simply false, however, is usually allowed.</p><p>\"They said they already have a fast process to tackle issues, but we insisted it's still too slow,\" said Takorn Tantasith, secretary general of Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission.</p><p>Officials in Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines told Reuters they support the verification center plan, saying fake news was a core national concern.</p><p>Philippines communications technology undersecretary Eliseo Rio said the country's authorities are also working on a \"one-stop\" content reviewing mechanism, where if one country decided it is disinformation, the company would remove it altogether and not just block it locally.</p><p>\"The individual governments can conclude these are fake,\" he added.</p><p>Rights watchdogs have warned that media freedom is declining in the Philippines, with several officials accused of propagating disinformation campaigns against opponents.</p><p>Sources familiar with the regulators' proceedings, however, said support for the verification centers was not unanimous across Asia.</p><p>Three executives at targeted companies said they didn't believe the idea would work, in part because it includes a wide range of global companies.</p><p>Facebook, Line Corp, Amazon, Netflix and Walt Disney were among those that attended a meeting in August with regulators to discuss the proposal.</p><p>Google and Netflix declined to comment, while Amazon, Facebook, Line and Walt Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Both Singapore and Indonesia already plan to impose GST taxes on foreign companies offering digital services, and talks are ongoing among Southeast Asian regulators for a region-wide effort. That topic was also discussed in the industry meeting.</p><p>\"Missing income is also a problem, and we asked for their cooperation on this too,\" Takorn said.</p><p>CAPTION(S):</p><p>FILE PHOTO: Facebook, Google and Twitter logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files.

The Moon administration says it will reduce the amount of work hours to 1,800 a year, from an average of more than 2,000 hours reported in 2016 by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm\">OECD</url>. </p><p>\"In Korea we work so hard, and the new administration is trying to introduce a more humane environment of research,\" Kim says. \"This is a workaholic society, so the new focus is making the research environment more aligned with how people actually live so that people could go home at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., which is still impossible in research areas.\" </p><p>While the country's major companies such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.samsungbiologics.com/front/eng/about/overview.do\">Samsung</url> have already looked at expanding into more ambitious fields of research like biotechnology and health, Experts say there is still much more to be done outside the realm of information and communications technology (ICT) that brought the country its top innovator status. </p><p>\"From the outsider's perspective, South Korea ranks very high on innovation, especially in ICT innovation, but domestically people are very much worrying about what will come after ICT,\" Kim says. \"South Korea has been leading in a narrow range of technologies centered on ICT, but if you look around other more science-based industries we feel we are so weak in these new fields. And ICT is going to reach a saturation point.\" </p><p>One path to boosting creativity and growth in other non-traditionally Korean industries might be to encourage important innovation happening outside of the big conglomerates, experts say. </p><p>\"People argue that there is not much creativity because of the way the system is set up,\" Ferrier says. \"It's so rigid that there isn't much opportunity for more creativity and that's why the government is trying to encourage more people working toward innovation growth not just in major companies but in smaller companies popping up of South Korea, as well.\" </p><p>Luckily, smaller and medium-size companies have more room for growth than in the past, as they are now more protected from the uncontrolled expansion of big conglomerates that invested in infrastructure and products ranging from <url normalizedValue=\"http://english.samsunghospital.com/main/english.do\">hospitals</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SBD-AB970S-Digital-Washlet-Controler/dp/B01FBTRSJ0\"> toilet seats</url>. </p><p>\"Here, automobile companies do laundry service, Samsung or LG are also running small bakeries,\" Kim says. \"The government created some years ago a committee so that specific products and services could be only done by small and medium companies. It regulates certain kinds of businesses that the larger corporations have to step out of.\" </p><p>At the same time, for longer more scientific research, the government itself -- an important investor -- will need to change its approach and offer longer-term support to research projects. </p><p>\"The government used to give research money on a very short term basis, one year, three years,\" Kim says. \"In that time span, only small application development or software development can be done so quickly. For biotech or in the pharmaceutical industry, it takes more than 10 or 20 years of investment both by the government and also by private companies, because it takes a long time in this industry to develop a single product.\" </p><p>Yet the future is anybody's game and true change in South Korea can come only from understanding both new industries, but also new way of doing things, experts say. </p><p>\"Maybe we are now very good at things that can be done quickly more than on things that require long-term reflection and more fundamental basic research, and this is one big challenge ahead,\" Kim says. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/sintia-radu\">Sintia Radu</url> covers international affairs and technology for U.S. News &amp; World Report.

South Korean officials did not mention specific materials or items that will be affected. </p><p>South Korea is open to discussions with Japan if the Japanese government requests them, Sung said.</p><p>The minister said the decision was made based on discussions that took place last week, and \"is not a corresponding measure to a recent regulation announced by the Japanese government.\"</p><p>He was referring to Japan dropping South Korea as a preferred trading partner earlier this month. Tokyo said then it wanted to ensure South Korea received the same treatment as other Asian countries and territories.</p><p>The standoff between the two nations started last month when Tokyo placed controls on exports of three chemical materials to South Korea. The materials, which are used to make computer chips, are vital to Samsung and other South Korean companies that make semiconductors. The curbs require Japanese companies to apply for licenses for each of the products, a process that can take up to 90 days. </p><p>Last week, Japan approved the first exports of one of the chemical materials to South Korea, but warned it could expand restrictions on dealings with its neighbor. </p><p>South Korea is Japan's third-largest trading partner, buying about $54 billion worth of Japanese goods, including industrial machines, chemicals and cars, according to a trade data tracking tool affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p><p>Tension between the two countries has been rising for months, stemming in part from Japan's colonial rule over the Korean peninsula in the early 20th century. South Korea's top court recently ruled that its citizens can sue Japanese companies for using forced Korean labor during World War II. Japan has denied that the two issues are linked.</p><p>\"As a victim of great suffering from Japanese imperialism in the past, we, for our part, cannot help but take Japan's ongoing economic retaliation very seriously,\" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday, according to the transcript of remarks released by his office. </p><p>\"It is even more so because this economic retaliation is in itself unjustifiable and also has its roots in historical issues ... While maintaining unwavering resolve and calmness, we need a long-term approach to look for the fundamental countermeasures,\" he added.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

I'm Julia Chatterley. This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Infections spike: South Korean coronavirus cases almost double in just one day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mind the gap. E.U. leaders battle to fill the Brexit budget hole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And sailing away. The CEO of Virgin Cruises talks about their new launch at a challenging time for the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome to the show on another FIRST MOVE Friday. Fri-yay. Almost the weekend and not a moment too soon, I think given the volatility on global markets seen over the past 24 hours.</p><p>Right now, U.S. futures set to open lower as you can see, adding to the losses that we saw yesterday. We actually saw big price swings in yesterday's session with stocks hitting an air pocket around midday; though, I should point out we did close off the session lows.</p><p>It feels a little lazy at this stage to blame coronavirus jitters, but it's clearly adding significant levels of uncertainty around the globe.</p><p>Take a look at the bond markets, too. Their pricing that uncertainty. Ten- year yields and now below one and a half percent. Investors predicting two further cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. That's the message from the bond markets right now.</p><p>Meanwhile, safe haven gold is on track for its best week in over a month and hitting seven-year highs. Goldman Sachs analysts out this morning saying they see more upside of up to 13 percent in fact, while warning of significant downside risks to commodity prices, too, going forward.</p><p>The data during the Asia session also a worry here. Japanese stocks falling some four tenths of one percent on word that factory activity there contracted at its fastest pace in more than seven years.</p><p>And in South Korea, shares there slumping one and a half percent as coronavirus cases jumped quite significantly as well.</p><p>In fact, the KOSPI was one of the worst performers of all the Asian majors this week, falling some three and a half percent and actually, South Korea is where we're going to begin today's drivers.</p><p>To the coronavirus outbreak and China is reporting nearly 900 new cases Friday including over 200 from prisons in Hubei Province.</p><p>There are now more than 76,000 confirmed cases worldwide, at least 2,200 people have lost their lives so far.</p><p>And in South Korea, cases spiked from 28 just a week ago to more than 200 today. Paula Hancocks is live in Seoul with more.</p><p>Paula, we have to be a bit careful here, I think that perhaps the fear overtakes the numbers here than anything else, but the two particular regions there. The Prime Minister said they're in an emergency situation. Talk us through what we're seeing.</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Julia, we've just come back from the City of Daegu, this is about a three-hour drive south of Seoul, and this is where the vast majority of cases over the past few days have been occurring, and they're all linked to one religious group.</p><p>Now, this is a group called Shincheonji and it has one particular building where there were religious services, one infected member went to those services according to officials, and that's where they believe many of the linkages come to that religious group.</p><p>So 204 confirmed cases; 131 associated just with that group itself. Now, it was a city that was certainly concerned, shall we say, it's a city of two and a half million people. I've been there many times before and it is always bustling. It is always busy.</p><p>But I was there Friday evening, and there was not many people on the streets. Those that I did speak to, did say that they were worried, they were concerned about what was happening and they didn't know where it was going to end yet.</p><p>So they certainly are concerned and this is obviously based on the fact that they know that there has been a significant spike in a very short period of time in their city.</p><p>Now just about a mile or a kilometer and a half away from this religious group building is a U.S. military base. I went to speak to the Commander of that Daegu base and he said that they are restricting movement on and off the base there.</p><p>[09:05:10]</p><p>HANCOCKS: They're prohibiting all non-essential travel from US military personnel to Daegu itself, and when it comes to the South Korean military, they have concerns of their own. Three South Korean military personnel have been confirmed with the novel coronavirus at this point, all in different provinces around the country, but all focused and have links to this one particular city, Daegu. That is a city you're going to hear a lot about in the coming days -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's the sheer degree of uncertainty, I think that's also part of the problem here, to your point. Have there been any official measures put in place similar to what we've seen in in China with the quarantine measures in particular, or is this just people simply staying off the streets because they're afraid here?</p><p>HANCOCKS: Well, in this particular area, we understand from health officials that the congregation of this one religious group in particular was over a thousand people.</p><p>They are trying to contact them or they say they still haven't managed to do that even days into this cluster becoming apparent. They say more than 50 people simply aren't picking up the phone at this point, which is a concern to them, of course.</p><p>They say that there are many who have been self-quarantined because they believe they have symptoms, and there are 131 associated with this group that have tested positive.</p><p>So when it comes to the U.S. military and the South Korean military -- because this area is heavily militarized in Daegu -- they are having mandatory quarantines of those who have had any kind of contact with this particular area.</p><p>And of course, the self-imposed quarantines when they believe that they have symptoms until they are tested. But much of what we're seeing within the country at this point is self-quarantine, for the 14 days that we're seeing elsewhere in the world as well.</p><p>They believe that this 14 days will encompass any potential incubation of this virus, but what we're seeing now over the past couple of days is not just pockets in certain areas. This is north, south, east and west in South Korea.</p><p>There are provinces all across the country now that have had at least one case.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And the challenges of that quarantine even if it's self- imposed. Paula Hancocks, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, the quarantine measures clearly having an impact in China, too. Chinese auto and the global airlines sector are impacted as the outbreak hits demand.</p><p>Chinese car sales plummeted 92 percent on an annualized basis in the first half of February. The airline industry also warning that the outbreak could cut global traffic by five percent costing it over $29 billion this year.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins us now on this story. I mean that's a significant fall in an already impacted market over with the Chinese autos, of course, but to be expected given a lot of people aren't going out and the quarantine measures in place, Clare. Talk us through what we know here.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia. This is a demand story when it comes to orders. It's also a supply story. We're hearing that from the Chinese Car Passenger Association that for the first 16 days in February, so this is high frequency data here. They're seeing a 92 percent drop in sales. They expect for the full month that will be about 70 percent.</p><p>So that is a big drop and we are hearing also from individual companies about what they're facing. Nissan saying today that they are expected to delay the reopening of some of their factories in China.</p><p>Volvo also saying that they're going to see sort of a staggered, reopening starting next week. We heard from the CEO of JaguarLand Rover, they are flying parts out of China. So that's the supply story.</p><p>They also say that the dealerships are struggling to get back up and running. There are no sales in China at the moment.</p><p>So this is something that car makers are really they're really grappling with. Don't forget that China is the world's biggest passenger car market. So it's heavily exposing all of these different car makers and again, airlines as well.</p><p>This was the front line, the first industry really that we looked at when this crisis broke. They now say the cost will be north of $29 billion.</p><p>Now, if we look at the comparison to SARS, that cost the global airline industry $7 billion in lost revenue. This likely now to be more than four times that, although I will say most of that concentrated in Asia-Pacific, about $28 billion of that lost revenue among Asia-Pacific airlines -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, it's key to look at -- and we're going to continue to look at this as the data comes through just to get a sense. And to your point, this is at least short term, high frequency data in the auto sector. So we get a pretty fair sense.</p><p>We've had survey data from industry all over the world today, and actually the one that caught my eye here; Japan, incredibly weak there. We're talking about a huge economy in the world, flirting with recession here.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. So we now have, you know, China at a standstill. That's the second largest economy in the world. Japan, the third largest economy in the world. We've got their Purchasing Managers Index Survey today, which shows that manufacturing business activity is at its lowest point in almost six years. It expanded its slowest pace.</p><p>Now, Japan, don't forget that economy has contracted in the last quarter at 6.3 percent on an annual basis, so this really reinforces the sense that that economy might not be able to avoid a recession. You know, that's two quarters of straight contraction.</p><p>And it wasn't all bad news, Julia. We got some slight expansion in Germany and in Europe, the U.K. as well, not as bad as expected, but there are cracks emerging if you look closely at those reports, as well, both in the U.K. and Germany.</p><p>[09:10:31]</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The manufacturing and private sector businesses reporting that there was sort of a slowdown in inputs and parts available for manufacturing, a slowdown in delivery times. All of that linked to the coronavirus.</p><p>So I think, we are just getting, you know yet another sense of just how intertwined these economies are with China and how this impact will be felt through global supply chains.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we talk about the United States here a lot on this show, but to your point, Asia-Pacific, Europe far more leverage to China and slow down there than in other parts of the world.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, great to have you with us. Thank you for that.</p><p>Now, the latest from the European Union, deadlocked over their next budget. Denmark, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, the so-called Frugal Four say they can't pay more to make up for the U.K.'s lost fees following Brexit.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins me now. And also, the chickens come home to roost here, Anna. But if those guys aren't going to pay up, who is?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: There are E.U. budget battles every seven years. They are always fairly epic. And they really lay bare the fundamental challenges and flaws I guess, of the E.U. Not all countries and economies are created equally. I mean, they have to play by the same rules and pay into the same budget.</p><p>So on the one hand, we have as he said the Frugal Four, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, led by Germany, the big arch hawk.</p><p>On the other side, we have 15 members, the poorer states like Poland, Hungary, actually led by France, which is a net payer as opposed to a net beneficiary, but have a very powerful farming union.</p><p>And this big battle of course has got worse this time around as you said due to Brexit. There's an $80 billion budget hole left by the U.K. leaving over the next seven years.</p><p>Now, the big battle here and the reason why the talks that started yesterday have yet to end, they may not end through the weekend. Firstly, those, the Frugal Four and Germany, they want to keep their rebates. That is something that has been discussed to be scrapped.</p><p>They also want to cap the budget to one percent of GDP, whereas France and the big, big spenders let's say, they want to see more spending on the E.I.B. That's the European Investment Bank and also lots more cohesion spending in the region.</p><p>So honestly, it seems to be not much compromise so far. But these E.U. Summits and these discussions do go on and on and on as you well know.</p><p>There could be some compromise, but we are waiting to find out what that would be -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I'm sure there are a few people in the British government that are laughing at this moment. So I will just make out the point that it is non-chlorinated chickens coming home to roost, at least for now.</p><p>Anna Stewart. Naughty. But it is Friday. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now, with some of the other stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>The U.S. says a deal with the Taliban to reduce violence is due to take effect at midnight, Afghan time. It calls for Taliban fighters, Afghan troops and international forces to refrain from attacking each other for a week.</p><p>If successful, Taliban says it will sign a comprehensive agreement with the United States on February 29th.</p><p>Top U.S. Intelligence officers are warning that Russia is looking to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. Sources tell CNN that the officials warned lawmakers that Moscow is taking steps to ensure President Donald Trump wins a second term.</p><p>CNN's Nathan Hodge joins us from Moscow. So I mean, I want to roll my eyes. This takes us back to 2016 where Intelligence officials said that the Russians interfered. Now, it seems they are looking to do the same again. What are the Russians saying about this and tell us more.</p><p>NATHAN HODGE, CNN MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF: Julia, yes, it looks like Russiagate 2.0. You know, the Russians today, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the reports about this briefing warning that the Russians were intending to interfere once again in 2020 elections were paranoid messages.</p><p>Now, this isn't straying very far from the standard Russian script. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said since the 2016 elections that Russia does not, has not and will not meddle in the elections of other countries.</p><p>Nonetheless, the conclusions of the Mueller report and the sweeping conclusions of the U.S. Intelligence Community have all pointed to Russia as waging a campaign -- an information campaign -- to interfere, put the finger on the scales of American democracy in the 2016 election, and the fear here is that that could be repeated.</p><p>Now, we are seeing some blow out, some blowback over the briefing last week by Intelligence officials, the classified briefing given to Members of Congress earlier this week.</p><p>President Trump announced that he was naming Rick Grenell, the Ambassador to Germany as his acting Director of National Intelligence.</p><p>Now, this is all part of the fallout over Trump's dissatisfaction with this this briefing, in which members of Congress, in which lawmakers were told that the Russians would seek once again to tip the election in his favor. I think he sees this as something that could be yet another asterisk over his presidency, should he win again.</p><p>[09:15:44]</p><p>HODGE: Certainly, the Russians have continued their denials. But it's always been interesting to see that the President with his criticisms of his own Defense and Intelligence establishment is often mirrored what the Russians have said as well -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I have to say authorities haven't done enough to protect against this, quite frankly in the past three and a half years, but I think it's the last thing Trump needs either to have this association perhaps that the Russians are pushing for his win.</p><p>Nathan, great to have you with us. Nathan Hodge.</p><p>All right, the Democratic Nevada Caucus set for Saturday. Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls after emerging unscathed from a scorched earth debate in Las Vegas.</p><p>President Trump holding a rally in Las Vegas today. It will be the third time he has rallied in a state where Democrats are about to vote.</p><p>All right, still to come on FIRST MOVE, the boat that rocked. Virgin Voyages is bringing rock star cruising to the new generation of adult only sailors. We will speak to the CEO.</p><p>And a table for two, for a bargain price of just four and a half million dollars. Meet the entrepreneur paying for lunch with Warren Buffett. Stay with us we're back after this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where John Petrides, Portfolio Manager at Tocqueville Asset Management joins us now. John, great to have you with us.</p><p>JOHN PETRIDES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TOCQUEVILLE ASSET MANAGEMENT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You were saying to me earlier that you think the market is looking for a reason here to selloff. Why? Why gives you that view?</p><p>[09:20:09]</p><p>PETRIDES: We had a huge year last year that's rolled into 2020. If you think of all the events that have happened, you know, conflict in the Middle East, coronavirus, trade wars with China, global slowdown, Central Banks printing money. You know, we're trying to artificially grow -- inflate our way to growth. But yet stocks continue to rise higher.</p><p>The valuations -- we are not cheap, really across the board. If you look at a price to earnings, price to sales. I mean, we're near higher levels that we haven't seen in quite some time.</p><p>So I think that investors are looking for something to pare back on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We get people on here saying actually there's a fear of missing out still, even with these markets, and actually underlying the economies of the world aren't doing so badly.</p><p>The real concern factor here is coronavirus and what economic impact that has, but you think actually some of the weakness here is political.</p><p>PETRIDES: Yes, I think the last two days, you know following Wednesday night's debate, and, you know, if you look at Democratic candidates, in my opinion, I think Bloomberg and Biden are definitely the most neutral. Maybe Buttigieg is a neutral and is a moderate as well. But Sanders and Warren are clearly more extreme.</p><p>And if you look at how -- this isn't a political statement, it's how the market identifies each candidate. There's the economic candidate and the social candidate, and regardless of what people may feel about President Trump on the social side, he is clearly very pro-business, and Bernie Sanders is picking up in the polls, and he is not pro-business.</p><p>I mean, he is talking about raising taxes and spending more and taxing the wealthy. That's not good for the market. So that's why you're seeing I think, a bit of a pullback there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, and this is what makes markets because we've also had the conversation on this show about the idea that actually a Bernie Sanders rise and candidacy for the Democratic Party will likely make it more likely that Donald Trump wins and therefore is positive for markets.</p><p>PETRIDES: I think that's right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's funny, isn't it?</p><p>PETRIDES: You can think about it in two ways. Right? Again, there's the economic track and the social track, and until the social track derails the economic track, and we've come pretty close under President Trump, you know, the markets are going to continue to go higher.</p><p>I mean, isn't it the irony that four years ago leading into the election, anyone that -- the market fear was, oh, my God, if Trump wins. I'm going to cash, gold and Treasuries.</p><p>And here we are with a significantly higher stock market, and now we're seeing the opposite about the Democratic candidate. It's just an amazing turn of events.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, don't listen to people who make judgment calls about political impacts on markets. But what is important? And I agree with you on this is, despite the fact that we keep talking about fresh record highs, within that leadership is coming from fewer and fewer stocks.</p><p>I mean, half -- half of the NASDAQ in bear market here.</p><p>PETRIDES: Yes, I think when investors buy a passive index fund of the S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, they have to look under the hood and see what they're actually buying.</p><p>Because the index fund is market cap weighted, meaning the more that a stock goes up, the higher the value of their company is, the larger the weight within the index. And right now, we haven't seen this type of stock in such a concentration, really since the dot com bubble.</p><p>I mean, the top five holdings which are you know, we all know them, the Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook of the world make up about 18 percent of the entire index.</p><p>And if you look at Tech and Consumer Services, which is Google and Facebook, those two sectors constitute about 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>So, you know, as an active manager, you know, one thing that our fiduciary responsibility is to diversify our clients assets, to spread out their bets, and not provide concentration with much sector concentration, because, you know, things revert to the mean, they go to the average. Things sell off and if all of our bets are placed in one basket, you know, that's not enjoyable.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're in trouble.</p><p>PETRIDES: But people buy the market, the index. So yes, they are on the market without understanding the underlying concentration. It's a concern.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly, are we at risk of a correction here? Goldman Sachs suggested we were. Do you think we are?</p><p>PETRIDES: I mean, people have been waiting for a correction for a long time. But, you know, is there a sell off with the Fed? You know, on hold.</p><p>The global central banks continuing to print money, I think any short term sell off is going to be met quickly with buyers because where are you going?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>PETRIDES: You know, we're at all-time high. We're approaching record highs with gold. Yields on, you know, in developed markets around the world, you cannot buy a long dated bond with a yield of under two percent, with over two percent.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that's the challenge.</p><p>PETRIDES: So where are you going?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes/</p><p>PETRIDES: So it's forcing -- it's forcing people to equities.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: John, fantastic to have you with us. John Petrides there, Tocqueville Asset Management.</p><p>Now, as we've been discussing, as the coronavirus outbreak kicks global trade, Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company remains undeterred in their quest to reduce their carbon footprint. I spoke to the CEO about the company's efforts. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOREN SKOU, CEO, MAERSK: We have had for more than a decade now quite an agenda to become more fuel efficient with our fleet. And since 2008, we have reduced our fuel consumption per container that we ship by more than 40 percent.</p><p>What that means is that we have decoupled our volume growth from our fuel consumption.</p><p>In the last more than a decade, our business has also grown 40 percent and we are emitting more or less the same CO2. We are using more or less the same amount of fuel as we did 12 years ago.</p><p>We also believe that we can continue down the road of becoming more fuel efficient about two percentage points per year, so that we can grow in line with the market without using more fuel for the next decade.</p><p>We're working hard also on trying to figure out how we actually get to a net carbon neutral position in in 2050. We, we articulated that target in 2018. And, during 2019, we identified, you know, at least three different types of fuels that that can help us get to net zero neutral.</p><p>[09:25:49]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Can you do it quicker? I feel like given the push that we're seeing behind the scenes right now, it needs to happen quicker than 2050. Would you agree?</p><p>SKOU: Yes. Well, I think that what we need to do in global shipping, we need to define what is the fuel of the future? And, hopefully we can find a fuel that we can produce in the quantity quality that we need, but also one that is carbon neutral.</p><p>We believe there's a good reason to think that we can do that. And then the fuel has to be produced -- actually produced at scale -- and we need the regulatory environment to be in place to mandate global shipping to use that fuel.</p><p>Thankfully, we have, you know, we are an industry which is regulated globally by the United Nations I.M.O. and that means that we can actually demand or regulate there. We have to use a certain kind of fuel.</p><p>So that I think, is something that gives us hope that we can achieve our goal of 2050 or earlier.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. The market opens next. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:30:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange. That was at the opening bell this morning. And as expected, we've got a lower open across the board for U.S. stocks. A weak tone globally today, too.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble and Coke are the latest U.S. multinationals to warn on the coronavirus outbreak. The week began, if you remember with Apple's big revenue warning, as a result of the impact.</p><p>I want to give you a look at what we're seeing in the Treasury market again. Ten-year yields tumbling below that 1.45 percent, the lowest level in fact, since September of last year. Thirty-year yields were at record lows. Investors at predicting two further cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year.</p><p>The St. Louis Fed President, James Bullard said today that he still doesn't think cuts will be necessary.</p><p>Now, it's not clear how the coronavirus outbreak will hit the cruise industry this year though, it is a glowing sector. Passenger numbers have almost doubled in the past decade to a forecast 32 million people this year.</p><p>More than 50 cruise lines are currently operating around the world. And today, Scarlett Lady, the first of four new cruise ships from Virgin Voyages, is making its debut in Dover, England.</p><p>President and CEO of Virgin Voyages, Tom McAlpin joins us now. Tom, great to have you with us. And I do want to talk about what you're doing with Virgin Voyages here. But first, I do want to talk about the impact of the coronavirus and what we've seen, particularly off the coast of Japan. Is it having any kind of impact on sentiment and on bookings for your voyages here?</p><p>TOM MCALPIN, CEO, VIRGIN VOYAGES: Well, thank you for having me. Good afternoon. Today is a very exciting day. We're here in Dover as we launched the Scarlet Lady on what I would call a showcase tour and take her to multiple places to Liverpool to New York to Miami to showcase the world.</p><p>So we're very excited about creating something very different and very unique in the industry. Hopefully, I have a chance to talk about that.</p><p>I understand your question on the coronavirus. And look, you know, the health and safety of our sailors and our crew are paramount to us. So we take extra precautions to make sure that we're doing all the proper screening, to make sure that we don't have any type of incidents on our ship.</p><p>I have to say that we are -- we will be operating out of Miami in the Caribbean where the coronavirus is not a problem. So we do not think this is something that will hurt us. Certainly, not in the long term.</p><p>You know, there's been a lot of speculation out there. But I think it's important to put things into perspective. There are more than 300 ships out there and cruise ships operating around the world. We have one incident in one ship.</p><p>So, you know we don't think this is a problem and we certainly don't think it's a long term problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you make a great point. One about the scale of what we're talking about here and the number of cruises that are in operation right now and geographically, you're in the Caribbean as well.</p><p>Just final point on this, will you operate a screening process as passengers come aboard just to be extra cautious?</p><p>MCALPIN: Yes, so I want to just tell you a little bit about what the Scarlet Lady is and our product. We are about creating something very different. It's a new experience. The cruise industry has been very successful. It is a very fantastic industry.</p><p>We are about creating a new way to cruise. We say set sail the Virgin way and that is all about being different. It's about our name. It say a little bit more about the transformational type of experience that we want to create.</p><p>It is about the size of the ship which is a mid-sized ship. It is the look and feel of the ship. So we want a ship that can be unique and interesting and be recognized anywhere around the world.</p><p>So we took inspiration from Super Yachts. And when you go on board this is you know, a fantastic experience built around six magnificent restaurants. Restaurants that you would want to go at sea with fantastic wine menus. And more than that, it's an immersive entertainment experience with a theater that transforms into three different configurations.</p><p>We did something very different in order to create this kind of boat boutique lifestyle at sea and that is we've created this for the adult market. And that means only 18 and above allowed on board the ship and that allows us to create an elevated, a more sophisticated experience.</p><p>We take you to the unique places. We're taking you to Bimini and we've created a fantastic Virgin Voyages Beach Club at Bimini for our exclusive use and think of this as kind Talu meets Ibiza and create these fantastic high end experiences for our sailors.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's quite fascinating actually, the growth in this industry surprised me, more than doubling of passengers over the last decade. It's reported what? $150 billion industry. But to your point, you're trying to cater to a younger, cooler -- if I'm allowed to say -- audience here. Talk to you about the use of technology here. Wearable technology in particular.</p><p>I believe there's a separate way of being identified. Champagne being brought to you, for example, getting into your cabin here. There is a technology element I think that's also critical for people to understand.</p><p>[09:35:30]</p><p>MCALPIN: Yes, so we looked for ways of trying to use technology and again, trying to differentiate across the board. So we will use technology in unique ways.</p><p>You know, we have an app and we have a feature called Shake for Champagne, where you can shake the app and order champagne and be delivered right to you in just minutes.</p><p>We use technology to understand where people are and help with wayfinding, and it is throughout. We've actually created our state rooms and our cabins that transform so during the day it makes up into a sofa so you can entertain, but at night, the beds come together and it creates this very, very special sleep experience.</p><p>So it is about using technology in different ways throughout and to enhance the experience and make it better. You know we want to use technology to communicate with our sailors. We want our sailors to be communicating back home. We use it to push information to reduce paper and to reduce waste.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I like the sustainable aspect as well. Just quickly. Where are you?</p><p>MCALPIN: Say again?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What is the room that you're in? Where are you?</p><p>MCALPIN: Oh, I am in -- I'm on the Scarlet lady. We're on deck seven. We are in a champagne lounge called Sip and I have to say that there are some fantastic bottles of champagne alongside and I just can't wait to go over there and indulge a little bit, but I'll finish this interview first.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Not while you're doing interviews. Tom McAlpin, President and CEO of Virgin Voyages. Good luck with it, sir. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>All right time now for look at our Global Movers. Shares of Deere are up after the company reported better than expected quarterly results. The equipment maker says it sees signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm industry.</p><p>And Sprint also in focus. The stock rallying this morning after it agreed with T-Mobile to tweak their proposed merger. The change would give T- Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom more control of the combined group.</p><p>And shares of Dropbox are jumping after its quarterly earnings report beat estimates. Wow. Look at that. Up some 22 percent. Dropbox also raising its profit margin outlook.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still ahead. Warren Buffett goes crypto crazy. I'm not so sure about that. The founder of TRON talk to us about his lunch with the oracle of Omaha. Did Justin make Buffett a Bitcoin believer? All of that more. Next.</p><p>[09:41:02]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To some, he is a controversial figure, but tech entrepreneur, Justin Sun says the way most of his download content is for the last century.</p><p>Sun is the founder and CEO of the Singapore based TRON Foundation. TRON is a blockchain network and Sun has developed what he calls a next generation operating system to allow easy and more cost effective sharing of digital content. He says the TRON platform is great for buyers and sellers alike. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JUSTIN SUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, TRON: Basically, like everybody today, we have a smartphone, Samsung, Google, all the companies are using Android and Apple of course, they use iOS.</p><p>So for old operating system in the world, there's a lot of developers, they develop like applications for the operating system. So you can check out like the App Store, you can see lots of the games, lots of the content, and lots of the other applications on the phone.</p><p>So you download those applications. So TRON is more like iOS and the Android. So we are like an operating system. And the developers, they will contribute their code and their application into the system.</p><p>So actually, the users, they can play the game, come to the platform like everything on top -- building on top of TRON.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But explain the blockchain, the decentralized nature of what you've created here, because I think for most people, when you're talking about an operating system, they go, yes, yes, yes, I get it. But what makes you unique? Explain why this is unique.</p><p>SUN: First of all, the privacy of user is not controlled by a decentralized operating system.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>SUN: So today, like for example, Apple, Google, Facebook, and all the large companies, they control users' data and users' privacy. They can choose suspend, like users account or release the users' privacy to other people.</p><p>But in decentralized ecosystem, so we are just the system builders. We don't control like any user data. Privacy is all preserved by users themselves.</p><p>For example, also the digital assets user have -- our account system is also preserved by themselves. It's not like preserved by the system.</p><p>So I believe this is a more democratic system. So its benefits the internet a lot by advocating this kind of a decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We often talk about utility value here. People pay for the content using the TRON cryptocurrency or coin called Tronix, TRX. But Sun says he wasn't satisfied with just building a cutting edge content sharing platform in his view.</p><p>His company also bought the file sharing service BitTorrent. Sun talked to me about why and what the benefits are.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUN: BitTorrent is the world's first, like a decentralized File Transfer Protocol. Now, only in the world, over a hundred million people use these to transfer the files every day. A lot of the big companies like Facebook, Blazor and U.S. government is also using BitTorrent as a protocol to transfer their data. So this is like the first largest decentralized protocol.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So how do you fit with other platforms, other data sharing providing platforms like Twitter, like Facebook? How do you see the evolution of them compared to what you're creating here?</p><p>SUN: I believe right now, the large company eventually will be evolved to like, even more centralized structure, because in the centralized structure, it is easy for the company to monetize the data and also recommend that to their clients.</p><p>So that's why I believe the majority of the centralized company they will come to our end to be like an even more centralized platform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:45:13]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's interesting, who owns the data? Who controls the data? And who can use the data? Now, Sun not only helped create the altcoin, the alternative coin, Tronix, he also says he invests in other digital currencies and recently got the chance to introduce one of the most famous investors in the world to all things crypto, I'm talking Warren Buffett.</p><p>But first, here's a view on where he thinks crypto goes from here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUN: Basically, I'm like a crypto believer, so I cover like all my assets in 2013. So these days, I only exchange the crypto to fiat if I need to spend money in my daily life.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Of course. Do you own other digital assets like XRP for example, or Etherium? Are you diversified within your portfolio?</p><p>SUN: Yes, definitely. I own a lot of the XRP, and the Etherium, too. I'm like a long term believer of the crypto. So I want like all the crypto assets to succeed. So that's why I own a lot of the other different crypto as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Price predictions on some of these by the end of -- I don't know, 2025?</p><p>SUN: Sure. Wow.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You can tell me what you want to predict? I am in stock.</p><p>SUN: Yes, sure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Go ahead, do 2021.</p><p>SUN: Yes, sure, sure. I can do some of the prediction because I'm like a long term like a believer of blockchain. I definitely believe Bitcoin will pass 100K in 2025. I believe this price, maybe even we can achieve this price before like 2025.</p><p>At the same time, I think a lot of the other cryptocurrency projects like TRON, Etherium, like XRP, I believe all the projects will also get into a bull market as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Did you say this to Warren Buffett, by the way? Did you tell him that you thought that he probably recognized Bitcoin perhaps more than anything else at this moment? Did you tell him that you thought it could be $100,000.00 by 2025? And if you did, what did he say?</p><p>SUN: I haven't said to him because I want him to more understand the fundamental parts of the blockchain and also crypto.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I get it.</p><p>SUN: Yes. So that's why I showed him like how do you transfer TRX and why blockchain? It's just takes like a second. And also like how like TRX integrate with Samsung phone so it is easier to transfer the tokens between two phones.</p><p>I also tell him like crypto is the money for the next generation. It is the money for the internet. So I think right now, Warren Buffett, he was curious to see, like what's going to happen in the next five to 10 years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Whether it's investing or beyond? What advice did he give you?</p><p>SUN: Warren Buffett tells me if you want to survive in the capital market for over 60 years, you need to be very cautious. You need to always pray for certainty over uncertainty.</p><p>That's why when we talked about a lot of the investment opportunity, that's the thing he tells me. We always need to focus on the certainty. And we need to know like, for the next five to 10 years, what's like the most certainty in the world and bet a huge chunk of the money on the certainty.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's interesting advice. I mean, did you manage to convince him of the merits of investing in digital assets or blockchain technology because for most of these people that's something otherworldly.</p><p>SUN: Yes, first of all, I believe Warren Buffett was very open to new technology and the crypto and the blockchain. That's why he accepted my first Bitcoin and the TRX I sent to him. So basically Warren Buffet is a Bitcoin holder now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Justin Sun there. Warren Buffett though perhaps not quite a true believer, yet but at least open to new technologies. We will know for sure this weekend when he publishes his yearly letter to shareholders.</p><p>Investors want to know if the oracle of Omaha is closer to putting any of these war chests of more than $120 billion in cash to work. Paul La Monica joins is on this story.</p><p>Paul, we can talk about his crypto ambitions or not.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I don't think he is going to buy $120 billion worth in Bitcoin or Ripple.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No. No.</p><p>LA MONICA: He got a gift though. Justin did give him a gift apparently.</p><p>Probably, we'd would rather talk about Apple as an investment he would about investments like Heinz, I have to say.</p><p>LA MONICA: I would think so. I mean, Apple has been a huge success for Berkshire Hathaway. Clearly, he timed that investment really well. You know, even though Apple has come back a little bit lately on some of the concerns about, you know, China demand and supply chain issues because the coronavirus, but still, Apple has been a big hit for Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p>[09:50:18]</p><p>LA MONICA: And it's interesting because he's had an aversion to tech in the past. He used to be a big shareholder in IBM, but given IBM's troubles, he's now out of that. And Apple is the largest holding by far for Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: At least 14 percent now, isn't it, of their market cap?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it's a gigantic holding for the company. It dwarfs pretty much all the other investments. But the interesting thing is that, you know, Berkshire Hathaway has still lagged the broader market lately because even though they have a big bet on Apple, who doesn't have a big bet on Apple?</p><p>This passive world we live in right now, everyone is in the FAANGs. He has just a small stake in Amazon and he doesn't own any of the other Big Tech. So you look at some of the other portfolio holdings, Wells Fargo has struggled. Delta struggled. And then Kraft Heinz. Oof. That's all we can say about that.</p><p>It's been a disaster, and it seems like there's no end in sight to the problems that that company as investors are shunning the stock because consumers are shunning their food.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And you make such a great point there as well about this shift of passive investing and the sheer quantity, the rise of money and the huge proportion of the market that's now being shifted into these kind of momentum stocks.</p><p>For him as a value investor looking for value in these markets is increasingly tough.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it has been difficult and that is why this company continues to amass a larger war chest of cash, you know, nearly $130 billion. He has talked about wanting to do another gigantic deal, but the valuations don't seem to make sense.</p><p>There were reports and Buffett confirmed it to the FT a few weeks ago that Berkshire was approached by Tiffany when Tiffany was up for sale. And Berkshire turned it down even though Berkshire Hathaway owns a bunch of jewelers in its portfolio, you know, as operating companies. So you then wound up having LVMH run by Arnault, one of the few people on the planet wealthier than Warren Buffett coming in and buying Tiffany instead. So it's tough for Buffett to find value.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes or no, Paul, because we only have about 20 seconds. Probability of Warren Buffett buying Bloomberg LP if we saw Michael Bloomberg winning the presidential election? $60 billion dollars that would make a splash.</p><p>LA MONICA: No.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No?</p><p>LA MONICA: No, he just got out of the newspaper business. I don't really wants to go into media new or old or what have you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There is power in data though. Paul La Monica, we will reconvene on this conversation perhaps.</p><p>All right, Paul La Monica, thank you. Now, after the break, a supreme victory in getting us hyped up about cookies by putting one brand on top of another is making us all say, crumbs, in a very British way. We are back after this.</p><p>[09:55:05</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where we are losing a little bit more ground here. As you can see, markets at this moment down just over 1.3 percent for the NASDAQ since the tech stocks did a pulling back hereto. We'll keep an eye on it. We're back with \"The Express\" in a couple of hours' time.</p><p>But now, a couple of stories to bring to you before we go. Taking the biscuit. Streetwear brands Supreme is teaming up with Oreo to create the Supreme Oreo.</p><p>While a pack usually costs $3.50, the Supreme Oreo is $8.00 for three cookies. Wow.</p><p>Taking the biscuit. But that may still be a bargain. One pack is selling for $17,000.00 on eBay. Crazy.</p><p>And we like burgers on this show. McDonald's puts it spin on dinner by candlelight. The fast food chain is releasing candles that smell like Quarter Pounder ingredients. From ketchup to cheese, the candles come in six flavors and celebrate the burger's nearly 50-year run. Eww.</p><p>That just about wraps up the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. Have a great weekend.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020022101cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8C-GY11-JB20-G2XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Business-to-business sales are not affected.\u00a0</p><p>Lawmakers who authored the bill say the change provides a legal basis to broaden discussions on imposing the so-called \u201cGoogle tax,\u201d or corporate tax imposed on global ICT companies accused of dodging taxes.</p><p>They also contend that it is a step in ensuring that foreign ICT giants running major digital businesses in South\u00a0Korea -- like Google, Facebook, Amazon Web Services and Airbnb -- are held to the same tax policies affecting South\u00a0Korean firms in the same business space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Efficacy questions</emphasis></p><p>Although it is a step forward from the perspective of those that have been calling for stricter tax policies, the latest revision is also being labeled as \u201conly a symbolic gesture\u201d that brings little changes.\u00a0</p><p>The original bill had mandated foreign tech companies to pay VAT on revenue from B2B sales made in South\u00a0Korea, the segment that generates the most profits in areas like online ads and cloud computing.\u00a0</p><p>By excluding B2B sales, the government still cannot tax the main business activities that generate the most profit for foreign ICT companies, critics argue.\u00a0</p><p>For this reason, it is unlikely that the new legal changes will enable the South\u00a0Korean government to collect an additional 400 billion won ($354.5 million) in tax revenue from global internet companies -- an estimate proposed at prior National Assembly discussions on the VAT Act revision.</p><p>Nonetheless, \u201c(The VAT Act revisions) can become the starting point for a more comprehensive tax system governing digital companies,\u201d said Rep. Park Sun-sook of the minor opposition Bareunmirae Party, who had proposed the amendments on behalf of 15 lawmakers.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moves toward \u2018Google tax\u2019 continue</emphasis></p><p>On a similar note, Rep. Byun Jae-il of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea proposed four bills aimed at resolving the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d problem in South\u00a0Korea\u2019s ICT sector in September.\u00a0</p><p>Among them is an amendment to the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, mandating foreign internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix to install physical servers within South\u00a0Korea in order to operate here.</p><p>Byun argues that if passed, the stipulation would mandate foreign ICT firms deliver more stabilized services to South\u00a0Korean users, and be governed by the same laws and tax regulations affecting their South\u00a0Korean counterparts.</p><p>Establishing a \u201clevel playing ground\u201d for foreign and domestic ICT businesses was the main agenda pushed at the Ministry of Science and ICT\u2019s parliamentary audit held in October.</p><p>During the audit, South\u00a0Korea\u2019s ICT Minister Yoo Young-min pledged to work with related ministries to determine the exact amount of taxes foreign ICT firms pay in South\u00a0Korea, and the standards under which they are being calculated.\u00a0</p><p>South\u00a0Korea\u2019s moves toward a \u201cGoogle tax\u201d come in line with global efforts to push for stronger digital taxes on big tech companies. The movement has been most pronounced in Europe, though reaching a consensus across the European Union has proven more difficult.\u00a0</p><p>In March this year, the European Commission proposed levying a 3 percent tax on the turnover of digital companies with annual worldwide revenue of more than 750 million euros ($920 million) and EU revenues of more than 50 million euros.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Korea Herald (Korea)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-87909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYF-6F31-JDSH-23PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency sai...</p><p>SEOUL, South Korea __ South Korea\u2019s new coronavirus daily tally has remained in two digits for a third straight day as authorities called for public vigilance during one of the country\u2019s biggest holidays.    The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said Saturday that the 75 virus cases added in the past 24 hours took the country\u2019s total to 24,027 with 420 deaths.    South Korea\u2019s caseload has recently displayed a downward trajectory following a spike in new infections between early August and mid-September. Stringent social distancing rules were credited with slowing the outbreak.    But worries about a rebound in new cases have grown again as South Korea is on the traditional autumn \u201cChuseok\u201d holidays this week that would certainly increase public mobility.    ___    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:    \u2014 Hit by COVID-19, Trump taken to military hospital    \u2014 GOP faces election reckoning with Trump's virus strategy    \u2014 Trump has several strikes against him \u2014 age, obesity, elevated cholesterol and being male \u2014 that could put him at greater risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus.    \u2014 Siblings, grandparents and adult children of Canadians and permanent residents are among those who will soon be exempt from COVID-19 border restrictions in Canada.    \u2014 There's a growing number of world leaders who have been infected with the coronavirus. President Donald Trump joins British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.    ___    Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url>    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:    LANSING, Mich \u2014 A 1945 law repeatedly used by Gov. Gretcher Whitmer to respond to the coronavirus pandemic was declared unconstitutional Friday by the Michigan Supreme Court, a striking decision that puts months of restrictions in jeopardy while COVID-19 continues to flare up around the state.   (Ad)  With most investors focused on big tech, a frenzy is quietly erupting in one tiny sector, with gains like 500% in two months and 104% in a single day.    The opinion is an extraordinary development in a monthslong conflict between Whitmer, a Democrat, and Republicans who control the Legislature and have complained that they\u2019ve been shut out of major orders that have impacted education, the economy and health care.    Coincidentally, the court\u2019s action emerged on the same day that Whitmer\u2019s foes submitted more than 539,000 signatures in a bid to repeal the 1945 law.    The governor said the 4-3 decision, with Republican-nominated justices in the majority, was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d But Whitmer didn\u2019t signal that she was giving up. She said her emergency declaration and related orders still can remain in place for 21 days, and then many of them will continue \u201cunder alternative sources\u201d of law.    ___    CHICAGO \u2014 News that President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus sparked an explosion of rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories that littered social media feeds.    By Friday morning, nearly 30,000 Twitter users had retweeted a variety of conspiracy theories about the news, according to an analysis by VineSight, a tech company that tracks online misinformation.    The news is ripe for foreign and domestic internet instigators to exploit by pushing online disinformation about the two presidential candidates and opens the door for unwitting people to spread misinformation without realizing what they\u2019re sharing is false, experts say.    Facebook said Friday that it immediately began monitoring misinformation around the president\u2019s diagnosis and had started applying fact checks to some false posts.    Twitter, meanwhile, was monitoring an uptick in \u201ccopypasta\u201d campaigns \u2014 which are attempts from numerous Twitter accounts to parrot the same phrase over and over again to inundate users with messaging \u2014 about Trump\u2019s illness. The social media company said it was working to limit views on those tweets.    ___    SANTA FE, N.M. -- Economic analysts say that New Mexico is risking a public backlash and possibly overlooking recovery opportunities by not conducting an economic analysis of its pandemic-related health restrictions.    State and independent analysists told a panel of legislators Friday that consumer confidence is key to the state\u2019s recovery as time goes on. Staff at the budget and accountability office of the Legislature said the state should consider incorporating more economic indicators into its pandemic policy decisions and build an economic dashboard to better track progress of economic recovery.    The administration of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is taking a cautious approach to lifting health restrictions and reopening the economy.    \u2014-    MISSION, Kan. \u2014 Health officials in Kansas\u2019 largest county are making it easier for older students to head back to class even as coronavirus outbreaks in schools and sports infect hundreds statewide.    Johnson County\u2019s health department released new criteria Thursday that allow middle and high schoolers to switch to a hybrid mode in which they go in-person part of the time and learn at home the rest as long as there are safety precautions in place such as masks and daily symptoms screenings, The Kansas City Star reports. Health officials previously said that younger students could return to classrooms full-time.    The suburban Kansas City county averaged 113 new cases each day last week, which was the third highest new case count since the pandemic began, epidemiologist Elizabeth Holzschuh said. And cases have been rising among children under the age of 19 and showing up in schools.    Even with many students still learning online, 104 of Johnson County\u2019s 169 public schools, or more than 60%, have implemented at least one quarantine after a COVID-19 exposure, officials said.    Statewide, Kansas added 1,362 new confirmed and probable cases from Wednesday to Friday, bringing the total to 61,111. Kansas also added 20 more deaths, raising the overall number since the pandemic began to 698.    ___    ST. LOUIS \u2014 As Missouri Gov. Mike Parson continues to recover from the coronavirus, his office is declining to say how many members of his staff also have tested positive.    Parson\u2019s spokeswoman, Kelli Jones, has not responded to several requests for information on staff illnesses, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Friday. Jones did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Associated Press.    The decision not to provide information on illnesses within the office differs from the practice of other state agencies that have routinely reported virus cases since the pandemic began. For example, the Missouri Department of Corrections has reported 613 positive tests among employees since the onset of the pandemic, and the Department of Mental Health says 384 workers have tested positive, with four deaths.    An estimated three dozen people work closely with the Republican governor. Parson and his wife, Teresa, tested positive on Sept. 23. Neither has developed serious symptoms.    Parson\u2019s office earlier confirmed a number of staffers on his team were in quarantine and working from home after the Parsons\u2019 positive tests.    ___    BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 As the nation processed the news that President Donald Trump has COVID-19, Republicans in the Louisiana House on Friday backed a package of measures aimed at unraveling the state\u2019s coronavirus restrictions in an ongoing dispute with Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.    The nine pieces of legislation vary in approach. One would overturn Edwards\u2019 coronavirus executive orders for a month. Others would give lawmakers more ability to jettison all or part of future orders \u2014 or extensions of existing COVID-19 restrictions \u2014 the governor wants to enact. Another would require bars and restaurants to be treated the same in emergency orders.    \u201cIn order to have oversight, we have to have information and a seat at the table,\u201d said Rep. Stephen Dwight, a Lake Charles Republican.    The proposals \u2014 which won support largely on party-line votes with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed \u2014 move next to the Senate for debate. Senators earlier this week unanimously backed a more modest approach that would give lawmakers more oversight of emergency decisions, but no new authority to jettison a governor\u2019s emergency orders.    ___    BANGKOK \u2014 Thailand\u2019s self-exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra says he was hospitalized for about two weeks after diagnosing himself as having the coronavirus.    Thaksin, a 71-year-old billionaire whose main residence is in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, discovered he was infected there in late August when he tested himself with a high-tech gadget made by a company in which he is an investor, an unofficial spokesman in Bangkok for the Shinawatra family said Friday. Wim Rungwattanachinda said Thaksin tested positive again when he went to a hospital, and he was treated for about two weeks before being released.    Thaksin founded a political party after becoming a billionaire in the telecommunications sector, and became prime minister after winning a 2001 election. He was reelected in 2005, but the army ousted him in a coup in 2006, after which he faced several charges related to abuse of power and corruption. Thaksin claimed the cases against him were political persecution, and fled Thailand while on bail after a conviction on one of the charges for which he was handed three years\u2019 imprisonment. His investment in a UK-based company that claims on its website to have rolled out a \u201crapid, lab-free COVID-19 test,\u201d is just one of several business interests    ___    LONDON \u2014 The European Medicines Agency has started a safety review after some patients taking the coronavirus drug remdesivir reported serious kidney problems.    The EU regulator says it isn\u2019t clear whether remdesivir is causing the reports of \u201cacute kidney injury,\u201d but that the issue \u201cwarrants further investigation.\u201d    Remdesivir was given a conditional marketing authorization by the EMA on July 3 and can be used to treat people older than 12 with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen treatment. The approval for the drug was fast-tracked with the understanding that more evidence would be submitted after a license was granted    The EMA says the potential problem of kidney toxicity caused by remdesivir was evaluated when the conditional approval was given, mainly based on animal studies. It noted that kidney injuries can be caused by other factors, including diabetes and the coronavirus.    The regulator says recommendations for the use of remdesivir remain unchanged; doctors are already advised to monitor patients for kidney complications before starting treatment and not use the drug in patients with known kidney problems.    ___    LONDON \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization says he wishes U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania a \u201cfull and swift recovery\u201d after hearing they were infected with the coronavirus.    Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the world is still reporting about 2 million new cases of coronavirus every week. He appealed for countries to invest more in developing necessary tools like vaccines, drugs and quick diagnostic tests.    Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO\u2019s emergencies chief, declined to respond to suggestions that Trump\u2019s dismissal of numerous public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus, including mask-wearing and social distancing, may have contributed to his infection.    He says despite the escalating case count in the U.S., \u201cthere is no reason the U.S. cannot control this disease, turn a corner (and) get the disease under control.\u201d He noted such an effort would require tremendous work and money.    ___    DES MOINES \u2014 Iowa posted more than 1,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases for the third consecutive day.    State public health data posted Friday indicated 1,142 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with a 90,754 total of cases since March. The state posted nine additional deaths for a total of 1,367.    Iowa averaged nearly 900 cases a day in the past week. On Friday, 85 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties have a positivity rate exceeding 5%, the rate at which many public health experts recommend measures to slow the spread, including mask wearing and limits on crowd numbers.    Gov. Kim Reynolds has declined to issue a mask mandate, has largely opened the state for business and insists that schools must hold in-class lessons.    ___    ATHENS, Greece \u2013 Greece hit a new record with 460 daily confirmed infections on Friday.    Total infections have nearly reached 20,000 cases. With five more deaths, the overall toll has reached 398.    Officials says there\u2019s no need for new lockdown measures, provided the public obeys existing ones.    The infections Friday included 114 cases among workers at a canning factory in northern Greece, which has been closed. Starting Saturday, visitors from Poland and the Czech Republic will be among those needing a negative coronavirus test before traveling to Greece.    ___    MILAN \u2014 Italy has counted nearly 2,500 new coronavirus cases for a second straight day.    There\u2019s been more than 120,000 tests. The southern region of Campania topped the ranks at 392 cases, followed by hard-hit Lombardy at 307.    The Health Ministry says total cases reached nearly 320,000. Another 23 died in the last 24 hours, bringing the confirmed death toll to 35,941.    ___    DETROIT \u2014 Bus riders were stranded Friday in Detroit as drivers concerned about the coronavirus refused to report to work.    A union official says drivers were having conflicts with riders about wearing masks and facing other challenges.    \u201cJust because you ask someone about a mask, you\u2019ve got to fend for your life,\u201d Glenn Tolbert told The Detroit News. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point with COVID and all the other pressures ... all of these things are just piling up. I\u2019ve got people quitting on a daily basis.\u201d    Detroit buses serve an average of 85,000 people a day.    In March, early in the pandemic, drivers staged a strike over safety and the condition of their buses. In response, Detroit eliminated fares, promised more cleaning and told riders to enter and exit from the rear door only. Masks are mandatory.    Detroit\u2019s chief operating officer, Hakim Berry, says the city is listening to new concerns and working to get drivers back on the road.    A driver died of the coronavirus in March, days after posting an angry video on Facebook about a coughing passenger.    ___    YAKIMA, Wash. \u2014 Two hospital nurses have filed a complaint with the Washington State Department of Health, saying staffing and sanitation practices are putting patients and staff at risk during the pandemic.    The Yakima Herald-Republic reports Sylvia Keller and Alice Westphal say Virginia Mason Memorial has been dangerously understaffed, resulting in nurses working every day \u201cin anticipation of a disaster.\u201d    Virginia Mason Memorial declined comment because of hospital protocol prohibiting comment on an ongoing investigation. Health Department spokesperson Kristen Maki confirmed the agency received the allegations but couldn\u2019t confirm or deny if an investigation was opened.    ___   15 REITS Analysts Can't Stop Recommending   There are more than 200 publicly-traded real-estate investment trusts (REITs) that you can buy through your brokerage account. Given the sheer number of REITs, it can be hard to identify which real-estate stocks are going to outperform the market.   Fortunately, Wall Street's brightest minds have already done this for us. Every year, analyst issue approximately 4,000 distinct recommendations for REITs. Analysts don't always get their \"buy\" ratings right, but it's worth taking a hard look when several analysts from different brokerages and research firm are giving \"strong buy\" and \"buy\" ratings to the same REIT.   This slide show lists the 15 REITs that have the highest average analyst recommendations from Wall Street's equities research analysts over the last 12 months.

Companies like AT...Verizon, and Comcast just effectively convinced the FCC to self-immolate, dismantling huge swaths[2] of its broadband consumer protection authority (what could go wrong?). At the same time, the DOJ and FCC have been rubber stamping every terrible telecom merger than comes down the pike[3]. When it comes to telecom monopolies, you'll hear nary a peep from the Trump administration. Contrast that to the GOP and Trump administration's sudden, breathless interest in \"big tech\" monopolies. In case you'd missed it, top telecom lobbyists have spent the last two years pushing ironically for a massive regulatory crackdown on \"big tech\" companies.[4] For example Mike Powell, former FCC boss turned top cable industry lobbyist, put it this way at a 2018 appearance at an industry trade event:\"Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy,\" he said. </p><p>\"For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging. They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle,\" he added.\"So you'll notice here that telecom is accusing big tech of all the things telecom routinely engages in, from buying competitors to stifle competition[5], to laying claim to massive troves of consumer data[6] with little accountability or oversight. This bizarre asymmetrical policy positioning, where Silicon Valley monopolies are bad but telecom monopolies apparently don't exist, has since become a DC mainstay, as reflected by the positions of folks like Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn. Neither have so much as mentioned telecom in passing in their conversations about monopoly power, and the latter of the two has literally never seen an AT...olicy proposal she didn't support[7]. Enter Bill Barr, the former Verizon General Counsel who spent years helping Verizon crush competitors, violate privacy and wiretap law, and generally engage in all the kind of behaviors he's now supposedly policing. On that end, reports this week emerged stating that Barr has slowly been taking control of[8] numerous antitrust inquiries at the DOJ from DOJ antitrust boss Makan Delrahim:\"Barr has centralized oversight of antitrust matters under a handful of appointees in his office and that of his deputy attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen. Those moves have sidelined the Antitrust Division's current leadership, headed by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who for the past year has been the public face of DOJ's investigations into Silicon Valley's treatment of its users and customers.\"Delrahim of course flubbed the AT...ime Warner lawsuit, which I still believe had more to do with pleasing Rupert Murdoch[9] and pissing off CNN[10] than any serious concern about monopoly power. Such concerns are violently out of character for the Trump administration, which only seems to embrace such rhetoric when it serves a political purpose (see: the nonexistent censorship of Conservatives[11]). Delrahim also just came under fire recently for rubber stamping the controversial SprintT-Mobile merger in some very problematic ways[12], tying himself in knots to approve the competition-eroding deal. On one hand, you could believe that Barr suddenly and uncharacteristically cares about monopolies and is engaged in a good faith effort to more seriously police them, as Matt Stoller suggests here:\"He has an understanding of what it's like to be in competition with these monopolists. He understands what's at stake,' said Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly nonprofit. 'I have more faith in Barr than in Delrahim,' added Stoller, though he still predicted that Barr and the DOJ would bring a narrower antitrust suit against the tech platforms than he believes is warranted.The problem with this claim is Barr has never, in history, shown the slightest interest in seriously reining in monopoly power, as his time at Verizon[13] makes pretty clear. It's far more likely that Barr's interested in using the DOJ's antitrust enforcement authority as a political and personal blunt weapon. Notably to help this administration's BFFs in the telecom sector wage regulatory war on companies they (not at all coincidentally) are trying to erode video ad market share from. It's similar to the way that Ajit Pai has bizarrely demonized Netflix[14] while just completely ignoring much worse problems in telecom. As Mike noted in a recent interview with Mathew Ingram[15], it's also very likely Trump sees these inquiries as a great way to gain leverage in efforts like his misguided war on encryption:\"In reality, Barr has been (misleadingly) complaining about encryption to support his authoritarian impulses to want to have access to all information. This has never been the way the world works, and thanks to technology, law enforcement already has more access than ever to most information about people. The real goal here for Barr was just to use 230 as a wedge to try to break encryption.\"There's really been zero evidence to suggest most of these \"big tech\" inquiries at the DOJ are being seriously conducted in good faith. In fact there's ample evidence the wheels of DOJ antitrust enforcement have been hijacked for what has often been bizarre and petty vendettas[16] on behalf of Trump. But sure, a guy who spent years propping up US telecom monopolies and has never shown the slightest genuine interest in the problems monopolies cause is just the guy to finally fix the nation's longstanding monopoly problems, why not.Permalink[17] | Comments[18] | Email This Story[19] [ 1]: <url

Not only are the creative industries innovative but they are economically valuable; the UK's creative industries contribute about \u00a377bn to the economy each year and provide 1.7 million jobs.</p><p>Big Tech, however, is having an effect. We all use Google's search engine. But some in the creative industries are questioning the search engine giant's role in directing people to sites where they can download, watch, read and listen to creative work without payment.</p><p>Questions and complaints about such practices have been mounting and have become louder and more vociferous in the past five years. Now, for the first time in the past two years, these complaints are being considered properly.</p><p>There comes a time in every business's life where it simply becomes too big to be ignored. It happened with Microsoft and Intel and it's now happening with others, including Google. Interestingly, the European Commission's decision on Microsoft's internet browser led to a huge shift in browser usage, with Firefox and notably Google Chrome taking huge market share. Ironically, Chrome now has greater share than Microsoft Explorer.</p><p>The winds of change are blowing.</p><p>National governments, tax authorities and the European Commission have woken up to the power of not just Google, but other large firms such as Facebook and Amazon. On search, the commission could be nearing the end of its investigation, begun in 2010, as to whether Google has abused its position. More recently, the EU is investigating whether Google has abused its position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators. Amazon's contracts with publishers are also being investigated to see whether they made it harder for competitors to offer similar pricing.</p><p>There is also a broader policy discussion taking place as to how platforms should be regulated, which may lead to positive steps to curb piracy. Finally, there are the tax investigations, some more aggressive than others, as seen recently in Paris.</p><p>On privacy, Facebook is facing inquiries in a number of states across the EU. More significant perhaps is the discussion about how Big Tech transfers our data between the EU and the US. After the European Court found that the agreement between the US and EU did not protect EU citizens sufficiently, a new proposed agreement was developed, but this again has been questioned by regulators. Alternative contracts used by the likes of Facebook are also being questioned by the Irish regulator.</p><p>So whether it's privacy, search, tax payments, their role in combating piracy or how they might contribute to investment in news and content there are now a range of investigations facing Big Tech.</p><p>Most of the talk has focused on how these investigations and new legislation might affect large technology companies. What hasn't been discussed, however, are the huge opportunities this scrutiny might provide for UK and European-based innovation. I don't believe this is why the EU is undertaking its investigations, after all, the beneficiary of the Microsoft action was Google. But if greater home grown successes is a by-product, then that's fine by me.</p><p>For a long time people have asked why we don't have a European Google or Facebook. Clearly, there are a range of reasons as to why this hasn't happened, including access to capital. There is a question to be asked though, about why we don't have more mid-stage tech companies across Europe which have the potential to be as big as Google, Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp. The latest description for these mid-size companies is unicorns, a term used to describe technology firms worth more than $1bn (\u00a3680m) - the fact they are described in dollar terms is indicative of the problem.</p><p>Clearly the answer isn't for the EU to create these in some statist project. However, if Big Tech's power on the internet ecosystem is curbed, there are huge opportunities for new businesses. How many of us use preloaded apps on our android phones simply because they are there? Inertia is a huge block to innovation and a favourite means for monopolies to retain their position. How many of us use Google Play because it's there, rather than Deezer? Maybe Finnish firm Jolla's Sailfish operating system will now stand a chance and new mapping services might get created in places like Scotland, which has a thriving technology sector.</p><p>There will be much gnashing of teeth as the ongoing investigations and legislative proposals progress. What we need to consider though is whether we have the home-grown ideas, capital and people to exploit what could be a turning point on the internet. If we do, then we might finally have ourselves some European, British and, perhaps, even Scottish unicorns.</p><p>Pete Wishart is chair of the all-party group on intellectual property, the SNP leader in the Commons and the only MP to have ever performed on 'Top of the Pops' (in the band Runrig)</p><p>'If Big Tech's power on the internet ecosystem is curbed, there is huge opportunity for new businesses'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Nasdaq gained moderately to close at a record high for a second straight day, lifted by big tech names such as Facebook and Apple . Allergan shares rose 3.7 percent after the drugmaker's fourth-quarter profit and revenue topped estimates. Gilead Sciences shares tumbled 8.6 percent and were the biggest drag on the benchmark S&amp;P after the biotech company's weak forecast for its hepatitis C medicines. </p><p>Major U.S. stock indexes are hovering around record highs after a rally following the Nov. 8 election of President Donald Trump amid expectations he will usher in fiscal stimulus and lower regulations and taxes. But the rally has stagnated in recent days as investors await more details about Trump's potential economic policy agenda. \"Usually, this would be a period in which earnings and guidance drive the market,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"But because it's the first three weeks or four weeks of a new president who is promoting radical change than what has been going on, Washington takes precedence, I think, over earnings in the eyes of investors these days.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 35.95 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,054.34, the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.59 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,294.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.24 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,682.45. Financials, which have soared since the election, were the worst-performing S&amp;P sector, falling 0.8 percent. Goldman Sachs fell 0.8 percent, making it the biggest drag on the Dow, and JP Morgan dropped 0.9 percent. Bank stocks are sensitive to interest rate changes, and U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels in weeks. The real estate and utilities sectors, which tend to perform well in low-rate environments, were the best performing groups. \"As the yield curve flattens, we  re back to a very tough environment for financials,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \"They live off the spread.\" With about two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500 having reported results, fourth-quarter earnings are on track to have climbed 8.3 percent, which would be the best performance since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In other corporate news, Nordstrom shares rose 4.1 percent. Trump attacked the retailer on Twitter for dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing line. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, similar to the daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&amp;P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 51 new lows.

The S&amp;P 500 is now up nearly 5% year-to-date and the futures continue to inch higher.</p><p>Looking back at past instances when the benchmark index broke even following a bear market, the S&amp;P 500 has historically added another 4.5% over the ensuing six months, with the next peak arriving after climbing 71%, on average.</p><p>Still, this does not mean that US equities are now immune from further correction or a new bear market. The lessons from 1989 and 2007 show that US equities can enter another bear market within 12 months, despite fully exiting the previous bear market. In other words, further gains are not a foregone conclusion.</p><p>From a fundamental perspective, equity bulls are hoping that the next round of US fiscal support measures can be rolled out sooner rather than later, in order to preserve the momentum of the economic recovery. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent suggestion that Democrats are willing to compromise with Republicans may pave the way for the stimulus package's eventual approval, potentially translating into more near-term gains for equities.</p><p>Investors also have to remain vigilant over the rising US-China tensions, which threaten to erode Big Tech earnings. Such a risk could hobble the S&amp;P 500's primary driver that has propelled the index back to its lofty heights.</p><p>At least the Federal Reserve is ensuring a steady tailwind for equities, having rolled out unprecedented monetary stimulus.</p><p>Considering the ultra-low yields in fixed-income assets, all that money in the system is finding its home in riskier assets like stocks. Once a vaccine is ready for mass rollout, that could be the \"pedal to the metal\" signal for more market participants to head into equities, potentially at the expense of safe-have assets such as Gold.</p><p>Dollar in the doldrums</p><p>Looking beyond US equities, the Dollar index (DXY) has bounced off the 92.10 support, even as it remains near its lowest levels since May 2018. Markets expect more Dollar weakness to come, which is what the world needs in order to improve the economy's prospects of a post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>The upcoming release of the latest FOMC minutes could trigger another leg down for the Greenback, especially if there is an obvious signal that the Fed is willing to tolerate faster US inflation. The central bank's forward guidance or potential cues on its asset-purchase plans could also make for a more conducive environment for equities to explore new record highs, while potentially unravelling more of the Dollar's gains from the past two years.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

In fact, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 are hovering around record highs. The Dow has been around triple digits all morning telling a different story that we saw yesterday because fears about the coronavirus have been waning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A rally in tech stocks pushes the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 to old time highs. That's despite new coronavirus warnings from the Fed and the IMF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And billionaire Mike Bloomberg prepares for first ever presidential debate after he pledged, he would put his $60 billion business empire up for sale if he wins.</p><p>And Virgin Galactic shares enter the stratosphere as traders make big bets on the future of space travel.</p><p>Coming to you live from the world's financial capital here in New York. I'm Zain Asher in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening everyone. I'm Zain Asher. Tonight, cautious optimism on Wall Street boosts. U.S. stocks to record highs, looking at the major indices, let's take a look here. All three right now are in the green.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are scoring records. Tech, as you can see there with the NASDAQ is leading the way.</p><p>Coronavirus and how it could disrupt global supply chains continues to be the dominant worry despite all the green you see on your screen. Stocks are rallying because the Chinese are actually expected to unveil new, more aggressive measures to support the economy through the outbreak.</p><p>Despite the market gains, the IMF is warning that coronavirus is \"our most pressing uncertainty.\" Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva writes, \"It is a stark reminder of how fragile recovery could be threatened by unforeseen events.\"</p><p>Matt Egan is joining us live now. He is senior business writer at CNN. So when do you think about just what the market's reaction has been to the coronavirus. It's been a bit haphazard, I would say somewhat unpredictable.</p><p>There are some days where the market sort of takes the coronavirus fears in its stride. Today is a day like that. And there are other days where it really absorbs a lot of the fear and you see red across the screen.</p><p>Today was a different story. Walk us through it.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: Well, the fact that the market is at all-time highs right now shows that this really is like the Teflon stock market.</p><p>None of this bad news is really sticking. I mean, we have the coronavirus doing real damage to China's economy, the number two economy in the entire world. Apple issued that sales warning earlier this week. Adidas says that business activity in China is down 85 percent, and yet the Dow is hovering near 30,000, the NASDAQ up another one percent.</p><p>It's up 10 percent so far this year. It's really incredible. I think there are two things at play. Clearly, investors are betting that the coronavirus storm will pass and when it does, the economy and corporate profits are going to rebound.</p><p>We have to see if that plays out, but that's what the markets are betting.</p><p>The other one, of course, is easy money. All of this easy money from the Federal Reserve and global central banks have really, really supported stock prices and risk assets of all kinds.</p><p>Some of the analysts I've talked to have said that the easy money from the Fed is kind of acting like a safety net by supporting stocks.</p><p>It feels looking at all like the green on the screen, it feels like more of a trampoline though.</p><p>ASHER: I like that. So we did actually get Fed Minutes as well just a few moments ago. They were looking at -- we've got Fed Minutes from the policy meeting, January 27th and 28th. What do they say about -- I mean, obviously a lot has changed since then. What did they say about coronavirus fears, especially disruptions from the Chinese economy and how that would affect the U.S. economy?</p><p>EGAN: Well, the Fed is acknowledging that this is a problem. The Minutes that was just released earlier this afternoon, they said that the coronavirus has \"emerged as a new risk to global growth.\" And they say that participants have agreed that it warrants close watching.</p><p>So the Fed is going to monitor this. They're going to look to see what other companies besides Apple and Adidas come out with profit warnings and how this impacts overall growth.</p><p>It's interesting that the market is betting that the Fed is not done cutting and that is what is also driving the market. The Fed cut rates three times last year and there's an 84 percent chance that the Fed cuts again, before the end of this year.</p><p>Neel Kashkari, the President of the Minneapolis Fed, he was out today. He said he thinks the Fed is going to do nothing for three to six months. But he said after that he thinks the next move will be down.</p><p>ASHER: Matt Egan, live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>In Yokohama, Japan as the remaining passengers who tested negative for coronavirus begin disembarking from the Diamond Princess, the cruise lines President has been speaking exclusively to CNN.</p><p>Jan Swartz says her heart breaks for the passengers forced to endure the quarantine on board. The ship had the largest concentration of coronavirus outside of China.</p><p>Experts are questioning the effectiveness of the quarantine.</p><p>Matt Rivers asked if it worked.</p><p>[15:05:14]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAN SWARTZ, GROUP PRESIDENT, PRINCESS CRUISES: What I can say is today, as our guests disembarked, they had tested negative for coronavirus. They had a health check right before they got off. They had a thermal screening.</p><p>And the Japanese Ministry of Health issued them a certificate saying that they had tested negative for coronavirus.</p><p>So I would just defer those types of questions to the Japanese Ministry of Health who have been in charge.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: On a human level though, you can understand the concerns if you put yourself in the shoes of those passengers, you can understand why some people may feel that way or they might feel uncomfortable.</p><p>SWARTZ: I think on a human level, right, this is an unprecedented situation. I mean nobody going on vacation thinks that they're going to be notified in the last days that they've got an extension of 14 days and they're not going to be allowed to leave their cabin.</p><p>So our heart breaks for everybody who experienced the situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: In the last two weeks of quarantine on the Diamond Princess, the number of cases tied to the ship surged from just 10 to 624. It sparked a crisis inside the cruise industry.</p><p>Carnival Corporation has borne the brunt of the fallout. Shares the Princess Cruise's parent company are down more than 15 percent in the past month.</p><p>The Westerdam ship operated by HollandAmerica, but also owned by Carnival was carrying more than a 2,300 people. It was denied entry into countries around the South China Sea before it finally docked in Cambodia last week.</p><p>More than a thousand people are still on board. One of the disembarked passengers tested positive for the virus on her way home.</p><p>James Hardiman is the Managing Director of Leisure and Travel Equity Research at Wedbush Security. He joins us live now from Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>Thank you so much for being with us. So just walk us through what you think A, the short term impact is going to be on the cruise industry and what the longer term impact will be and if there is a difference?</p><p>JAMES HARDIMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF LEISURE AND TRAVEL EQUITY RESEARCH, WEDBUSH SECURITY: Well, there's certainly a difference. I think short term, I mean, we're really still working through the initial assessment, the initial quantification of what these companies think is going to be the earnings impact.</p><p>Carnival won't report for another month or so. Royal reported two weeks ago and the region report is tomorrow and even since Royal reported, very recently, they've significantly increased the earnings fallout estimate.</p><p>I think that's evidence that this is very much a developing story. It's very much fluid math that we're dealing with.</p><p>Long story short, I think if you were to look at published estimates right now, they're all going to need to come down. I think most investors get that at this point.</p><p>Long term is a lot more difficult of a question. These stocks, if you look at Carnival, Royal and Norwegian, they're down anywhere from 15 to 20 percent. I feel comfortable in saying that you're not looking at that magnitude of a permanent impairment to these companies earnings power.</p><p>And so I do think it's a -- you know, for those willing to take on a little bit of risk, now might be a good time to get involved, but between here and there, it's going to be a rollercoaster ride.</p><p>I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen tomorrow. What's going to happen next week, what's going to happen next month? Obviously, the concern would be that this would have a lasting impact on the psyches of potential cruise passengers.</p><p>I don't think we're necessarily there yet, but that would be the concern.</p><p>So how does the industry signal to investors that actually they do have things under control?</p><p>HARDIMAN: Well, I think they need to be careful to show confidence in the broader opportunity for the industry and for their respective companies, but not signal anything that they can't back up.</p><p>I don't think they necessarily have this under control and I think any communication otherwise would potentially get them in trouble.</p><p>Again, using Royal Caribbean as an example, again, they are the only ones that have actually reported earnings since the fallout of coronavirus. They were in the unenviable position where they needed to give full year 2020 guidance really not knowing where this was headed.</p><p>And so what they ultimately did is said, you know this is what we were going to make before the coronavirus fallout. This is what our current estimate is for the fallout which was at the time 25 cents, it's since been up to at least 65 cents.</p><p>But they didn't make any assertion that that was the end of it. That that was the extent of the impact of the fallout because, you know, ultimately they don't know.</p><p>[15:10:14]</p><p>ASHER: So based on Royal Caribbean and their earnings, I mean and also based on the average price per cabin. What does a company like Carnival Cruises, which owns Princess Diamond actually stand to lose here?</p><p>HARDIMAN: Yes, it depends on A, how long these you know, ship bans or you know how long ships aren't able to go in and out of China. Number one.</p><p>And then number two, how far reaching the impacts are. Initially everybody I think was doing the math around ships in and out of China, and you know, our math was that in rough terms, you were looking at maybe $3 million to $4 million of lost revenue per ship.</p><p>But then that quickly evolved to impacting broader Asia, which I think is where we are today. It's not just Chinese ships, it is ships you know, obviously going in and out of Japan and Singapore and other countries.</p><p>And then the bigger picture concern would be that it's now impacting Western consumers, and I think that the magnitude of that is probably limited. But I think, you know, if you were to ask your friends, right, the people that you've talk to, if they're in any way hesitant to go on a cruise, or even an airplane or a train, I think that a significant amount of them at this point would say yes.</p><p>The good news is, I think Western consumers over the years have been shown to be exceedingly resilient, as we exit major events, and there's plenty to look back on for this industry.</p><p>But as we sit here in the middle of it, I think it's safe to say that that bookings are being impacted.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate you joining us.</p><p>HARDIMAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>ASHER: Three journalists from \"The Wall Street Journal\" have been given five days to leave China.</p><p>Beijing revoked their press credentials over an opinion piece titled, \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia,\" which the government says is racist. It represents the most dramatic Chinese crackdown on Western journalists in decades. There is so much more to the story than meets the eye.</p><p>Senior media correspondent Brian Stelter is joining us.</p><p>So, Brian, I mean, this raises all sorts of questions about freedom of speech, about China's desperation in terms of controlling the narrative when it comes to the coronavirus, however -- however, just putting that aside, you think about that headline, \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia.\" They say that is racist.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it has racist connotations.</p><p>ASHER: Don't they have a point here?</p><p>STELTER: They do. It has racist connotations. It has ugly historical connotations for China in particular, and I think \"The Wall Street Journal,\" which is known for being a conservative, a rightwing editorial page and the opinion section in the United States, the editors may have been trying to be provocative.</p><p>But you do wonder about the lack of diversity at media outlet like that. Now, having said that, the opinion division of the journal and the news division are completely separate. And this has all the appearances of the news division being punished for the opinion division's sins and that's troubling from a journalistic standpoint.</p><p>And that's basically the argument that Dow Jones, which owns the journal is making. They are saying, we regret that this headline has offended people in China. We regret that. But the news division needs to be able to engage freely in China and cover the news.</p><p>ASHER: What has the relationship been like between China and Western media ever since not just the coronavirus outbreak, but just going all the way back to the Hong Kong protests?</p><p>I mean, there has been so much tension between the two, no?</p><p>STELTER: Yes, there has been tension. Look, if you go back decades, we haven't seen multiple expulsions like this of international correspondents since 1989, since the Tiananmen Square Massacre.</p><p>In the decades since, there has been a sense of openness within China with some exceptions where journalists are able to travel and interview citizens, et cetera. There's not nearly as much freedom as there should be, but there is a lot of that freedom.</p><p>But we've seen, as you mentioned, with Hong Kong, there have been some scattered examples of visas being turned down of people only being given short term visas instead of long term visas to be working as a journalist.</p><p>So there have been these signs of friction, and this expulsion, this is a dramatic escalation to have three journalists from one news outlet kicked out all at the same time. We've not seen that happen since Tiananmen.</p><p>ASHER: And what's been the difference particularly under Xi Jinping's leadership?</p><p>STELTER: I think it is -- in the same way that we talk often times on this program and others about China as a rising power, they are finding more and more ways to exercise that power.</p><p>And certainly press freedom groups are saying today this is a troubling example of using that power to show you know, essentially weakness, like don't allow these journalists to do their work. That's really a sign of weakness even though China is presenting it as a show of strength.</p><p>This also comes only a few hours after the U.S. State Department announced the Chinese state-owned news outlets in the United States will be treated as foreign missions.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>STELTER: Meaning basically CCTV, other news outlets with bureaus in the U.S. are going to be treated as embassies or consulates. That's a dramatic move by the United States. So we might be seeing a tit-for-tat here.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Brian Stelter live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>Michael Bloomberg is just hours away from his first debate in the U.S. presidential race. His poll numbers are rising fast and his rivals are on the attack.</p><p>And shares of Virgin Galactic are taking off. We will explain what's driving the stocks sky high. Next.</p><p>ASHER: All right, welcome back, everybody. We are just hours away from Mike Bloomberg's first debate on stage with his Democratic rivals. The stakes are sky high for all the presidential candidates where the Nevada caucus is just three days away.</p><p>But billionaire Mike Bloomberg is likely to face the harshest spotlight. CNN's Cristina Alesci has been following it all.</p><p>So he is quite placed the harshest spotlight, Cristina, for a number of reasons, not least of all, is the fact that he's a billionaire within a party that has moved progressively to the left. What is tonight going to be like for him?</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think he is going to face fire on a number of fronts. To your point, they're all going to try and you know, paint him as the billionaire who is perhaps out of touch, who skipped the first four contests and now is strolling into this race, you know, hiding for the most part up until now behind all of these ads without facing any direct fire from his competitors.</p><p>That all changes tonight. But of course, what they're going to say is, he is, you know, he is out of touch with where the party is right now, to your point, that the party has moved left. That they want somebody who has a connection to the people, who kind of understands where they come from, not to mention, stop and frisk and his comments about redlining.</p><p>And even today, we saw Joe Biden go after him for attempting in his advertising to align himself with President Obama. And then Biden came out with an ad basically showing the number of time times that Bloomberg criticized Obama and his policies.</p><p>So it has been an all-day kind of preview of what we're going to see going forward.</p><p>ASHER: Obviously, Donald Trump and Michael Bloomberg are both billionaire businessmen, but Michael Bloomberg is painting himself to be in a way the anti-Trump -- the anti-Trump from a billionaire perspective.</p><p>Trump had his sons take care of his businesses after he became President. Michael Bloomberg, on the other hand is saying, listen, you know, I'm going to divest. I'm going to sell.</p><p>Obviously, when you're dealing with a $60 billion company that is a very tall order. It does not happen overnight.</p><p>ALESCI: It's not going to be easy, for sure. And right now, it is creating a lot of issues because not only does he have a financial information company, but a large part of his business, at least from the exterior for those of us on the outside, they know it for the news part of the business.</p><p>And that's creating a scenario where right now the reporters in the newsroom are confused about how they should be covering --</p><p>ASHER: You worked for Bloomberg.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes, exactly.</p><p>ASHER: So just -- yes, give us a sense of what that is like in the Bloomberg newsrooms knowing that the person who owns the company might actually end up becoming -- possibly -- we don't know, President of the United States. Huge, huge, huge dilemma for the reporters in that room.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes. Huge dilemma. And I can tell you that the Bloomberg reporters are like any other reporters at any other newsroom. They're aggressive, they want to uncover the truth, and they feel to a certain extent in this environment that they have their hands tied behind their backs, because there was an edict from the top that they weren't going to do any investigations.</p><p>So, you know, the question always becomes in these situations, what's a news story? What's an investigation? Where do you draw the line?</p><p>ASHER: I am sure they hate it.</p><p>ALESCI: It's very complicated. Yes.</p><p>ASHER: I am sure reporters hate it.</p><p>ALESCI: They hate it and so do the editors and everyone else. They're very confused. And this is something you know if Bloomberg continues, and we're going to have to see what happens with Super Tuesday, but if he ends up you know, continuing the momentum, they're going to have to address that.</p><p>ASHER: Of course, no doubt. All right. Cristina Alesci live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>Bloomberg LP is a company that is built around one key product.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to the Bloomberg, the total investment management tool, which lets you perform a vast array of analytical functions at the touch of a key.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Nearly 40 years after launching Bloomberg LP, Bloomberg LP now has an army of journalists and a TV channel, but its success and Michael Bloomberg's fortunes still revolves around the iconic terminal.</p><p>Let's look inside -- 325,000 people pay tens of thousands of dollars each year for a subscription. It's a must have for traders who need a vast array of data at their fingertips.</p><p>And a lot of subscriptions means, of course, a lot of revenue for Bloomberg LP, an estimated $10 billion every single year and Bloomberg owns 88 percent of it all.</p><p>It has made him a very rich man and very conflicted certainly if he were to become President.</p><p>An adviser to the Bloomberg campaign tells CNN that Michael Bloomberg will sell it all if he becomes President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, SENIOR ADVISER, BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN: Mike will release his tax returns. Mike Bloomberg will also sell Bloomberg LP. There will be no confusion about any of his financial holdings.</p><p>Blurring the line between public service and personal profiteering. We will be 180 degrees away from where Donald Trump is on these issues, because Donald Trump is a walking financial conflict of interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Joining me now, Tim Naftali is CNN's presidential historian and a former Director of the Nixon Presidential Library. Tim, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:* My pleasure.</p><p>ASHER: So here's the thing, Donald Trump didn't divest. He didn't sell. In the court of public opinion when it comes to how the public and the average voter on the street perceives you. Does Bloomberg even need to do this?</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, the question of course is, Donald Trump is not popular. He has an intense following, but he still hasn't cracked 50 percent.</p><p>So the question you need to ask ourselves is how do Americans want to see their Presidents in the future? Donald Trump is an exception.</p><p>Presidents before Donald Trump divested, sold, put, gave, created trusts, so there'll be no conflict or no apparent conflict of interest.</p><p>Donald Trump tested the waters, decided that his base didn't care and said, I'm not going to do that. But going forward, does that become the new normal? And that's the great debate about all kinds of aspects of the Trump administration.</p><p>So I would say it this way. Should Donald Trump be defeated, are the American people saying you know what, we want to go back to the old rules? Not necessarily the old ways.</p><p>ASHER: I don't know. I don't know.</p><p>NAFTALI: I don't know either. But I'd say that Mike Bloomberg, if he wanted to be Trumpian wouldn't have to divest. But I suspect one of the arguments and we can see it from his ads already, one of the arguments he is saying is, I'm not Trump. We don't need Trump. I'm going to be different. And he's, in fact talking about the way Presidents used to be.</p><p>So it would be bad for his brand for not to divest.</p><p>[15:25:09]</p><p>ASHER: Okay, so I want to talk about how Michael Bloomberg has changed the landscape of this race, and also what -- I guess, what sort of pressure he is under tonight because, yes, he owns a media company.</p><p>But does that really mean that he knows and understands what it means to perform on television at a time of, you know, a lot of public pressure, the entire country is watching you.</p><p>I mean, this is it. I mean, he could either surge or it's over after tonight.</p><p>NAFTALI: So if you see a smile on my face, it's not -- it is because those of us who study history and watch politics love uncertainty. That's the analysts in me. The citizenry does not like that.</p><p>I can't say we are going to find out. We're going to see how he does on a debate stage. We're going to see how he does on Super Tuesday where he swooped. He just came in like an eagle, and will he get all of these votes that he didn't fight for the way that Warren and Buttigieg and Sanders did in Iowa? And in New Hampshire? We just don't know.</p><p>Here is -- there are a number of question marks about democracy in the 21st Century. One of them is what prompts people to vote? Do you go to vote because you enjoy the show? Do you go to vote because you're thinking about your family's -- the realities of your family life?</p><p>We don't know. We were surprised in 2016 and turnout is going to determine 2020. Mike Bloomberg, I think is basically betting that there's a new social media era, and that you can come in without doing retail politics, without shaking lots of hands and become President.</p><p>ASHER: You can buy your way.</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, money is always --</p><p>ASHER: $400 million gets one to the debate stage.</p><p>NAFTALI: Okay, here's the thing. Yes, money. He -- it's his money.</p><p>ASHER: And he spent so much money supporting other candidates within the Democratic field who don't want to speak out against him.</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, okay. I think that every voter will have to make up her or his mind about the character of the next President. And they've got to decide if it matters how people made their money. They've got to ask themselves, how they assess the judgment of that person and the direction that person wishes to take the country.</p><p>So they are going to decide. Now, there's no question that Mike Bloomberg has changed the nature of the game, because he can Bigfoot it. He doesn't have to go and raise money.</p><p>Donald Trump didn't want to spend a lot of his money, but he had money. And Donald Trump had 22 million viewers, people who remembered his show, so he had his own set of advantages.</p><p>The question, you know, I think about is because somebody like Jimmy Carter, I'm not saying necessarily his persona or his politics, but somebody out of nowhere, could someone like that become President?</p><p>Now we still have some candidates in the race. Pete Buttigieg for example. His candidacy is not over and the story hasn't been told.</p><p>So it's not clear, okay, that a media mogul necessarily has all he needs to become President or at least nominated.</p><p>ASHER: Jimmy Carter party became President because of what happened before him. We have to leave it there. I am being yelled at in my ear. Tim Naftali, thank you so much.</p><p>NAFTALI: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: E.U. leaders trying to keep Big Tech in check by calling for the dominant firms to share their data. That story next.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Zain Asher. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment, when we'll look at Boeing's ongoing troubles for the 737 Max and how the company is reacting to new issues with its fuel tanks. And Christmas may be 10 months away but one Chinese toymaker tells us that the coronavirus could impact its supply of holiday toys. Before that though, these are the headlines we're following for you at this hour.</p><p>About 800 people who tested negative for the coronavirus was finally able to leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship after Japan lifted a two-week quarantine. It could take several days for everyone on board to disembark. More than 600 passengers have contracted the virus. The largest concentration outside Mainland China.</p><p>The top Pentagon policy official who warned against withholding military aid to Ukraine is now out of a job. John Rood wrote in his resignation letter that he is stepping down at the U.S. President's request. This comes days after President Trump fired two key impeachment witnesses involved in the controversy of aid to Ukraine.</p><p>And we now have a timeline for when Britain's Duke and Duchess of Sussex will begin stepping back as senior members of the Royal Family. A spokesperson for the couple says Prince Harry Meghan will close their Buckingham Palace office and begin a 12-month transition period on March 31st. Meantime, a source says the use of the word royal in regards to the couple's branding is being reviewed.</p><p>The E.U. has unveiled a new plan aimed at breaking down the monopoly power of big foreign tech. Officials say they want the dominant companies to open up their troves of data to smaller rivals in hopes it will create a level playing field. It comes after Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai did their best to get ahead of the game-changing announcement. Both men have been in Brussels trying to appeal to E.U. leaders.</p><p>Jules Polonetsky is the CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum. He was the Chief Privacy Officer at AOL for a time, as well. He joins us live now. Jules, thank you so much for being with us. So, the goal of the E.U. here is really some kind of regulatory framework that governs the use of data. Just walk us through it.</p><p>JULES POLONETSKY, CEO, FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM: Well, the E.U. recognizes that over the last decade or so, the big national champions on consumer data have been Google, Facebook, all the others. They see A.I. now as the opportunity to catch up, the next big thing that could really make a difference to economies and to the -- to the world. And they don't want to be caught behind the game. The strategy seems to be, put rules in place because if A.I. is not properly regulated, we could have discrimination, we could have, you know, A.I. running amok, all of the problems and the fears. And so, the hope is that by having a world of trusted A.I., the E.U. will set forward a path. But I think it's important to note that the President of the commission, when she came into office just a little while ago, promised that she'd regulate A.I. within 100 days.</p><p>[15:35:09]</p><p>That clearly proved to be a pretty big challenge. And so, what we're seeing now is a white paper that takes a little bit more time, sets out some rules, and in a lot of ways, talks about shared values. You know, everybody wants to make sure that A.I. does, you know, good things for the world, and doesn't end up being discriminatory. So, I think there's a lot to like here.</p><p>ASHER: Right. So, when you think about areas like health care, like policing, like transportation, just what are the risks and what are the vulnerabilities when it comes to flaws in A.I.?</p><p>POLONETSKY: Well, one important point that the strategy makes is it says there's really high-risk A.I., the kind that we really ought to go very slow if it's used for policing, if it's going to decide whether somebody gets out on probation, for transportation, you know, areas where we can't take a chance that just because it seems to be accurate and working, that it isn't actually doing something very risky, making unfair decisions, where we really need to understand it and have humans assessing it. And so, it says, for those areas, let's go slow. Let's have clear rules. And then the A.I. areas where perhaps it's lower risk, right? Maybe I'm marketing, does it make a difference that I send one offer versus another offer? Or, you know, I'm deciding which entertainment option to offer you next. Maybe you'll like this movie because you saw that movie. And that can go a little bit more quickly.</p><p>Where it could be a problem, though, is they do propose that in some high- risk areas, you might need to pre-check or pre-approve your technology with perhaps government agencies. Now, if we're looking to compete, and we want the European market moving as quickly as the U.S. as other areas as China, slowing down and pre approving really could be a barrier for some of those start-ups. So, they're really going to have to figure out how, when they get around to legislating, which they do promise that by the end of the year, they will do, they're able to balance sort of being trusted, and setting good rules without slowing down and overregulating.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Jules Polonetsky, thank you so much.</p><p>POLONETSKY: Sure.</p><p>ASHER: Another blow for Boeing; the American plane maker discovering debris in several 737 max fuel tanks. The company telling employees that this is absolutely unacceptable. This, as Boeing is hoping to get the jet approved to fly again by the middle of this year. Clare Sebastian joins us live now. So, Clare, what does this tell us about quality control issues at Boeing?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it tells us there are issues. Now, Boeing has faced problems in the -- in the past with what's called FOD, the sort of debris -- foreign object debris that you can find in planes, sort of gets ensnared in planes as part of the manufacturing process. Now, they have tackled this in the past. They say that they are now conducting a robust investigation there. They're updating their processes within their manufacturers to tackle this. And crucially, they are going to inspect every single one of the 737 Max planes that they have in storage, and that is a lot by virtue of this grounding.</p><p>And the fact that Boeing continued to produce these planes throughout the last year without delivering them. They have about 400 planes that are parked up in parking lots, various other locations around the U.S. and they're going to have to inspect all of them. That will be a painstaking process. But they do say, though, that this does not change their timeline for getting the Max back in the air. They still say the ungrounding will begin in the middle of 2020.</p><p>ASHER: The term debris will no doubt cause alarm for anybody reading or hearing the story. But just walk us through how dangerous is this type of debris that's, you know, generated during the production process? How dangerous is it or would it be for the flying public?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I mean, it can be very dangerous. It is an issue that, you know, all plane makers not just Boeing face. They all factor it in to how they regulate their assembly lines that, you know, I'm told there are signs up in the Renton Washington factory where the Max is produced that warns employees to be aware of this. It can be -- it can be all kinds of things. It can be metal shavings, it can be tools, it can be sort of rags that are left lying around, but it can interfere with the wiring of the plane, the engine, it can cause short circuiting, it could fry --</p><p>ASHER: My gosh, I'm already terrified of flying. And I --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: See, you want to be really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASHER: I wish I wasn't doing the story. Oh, my goodness. OK, I'm going to try and listen. Sorry, go ahead.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: But it can be really dangerous and, you know, the -- it's banned by the FAA that they have to now ,you know, not only clear out the stuff they found, but they have to make sure there's not a systemic issue in the -- in the manufacturing process. That's why they're conducting this internal review now.</p><p>ASHER: Clare Sebastian. I must thank you so much.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASHER: Don't laugh at me. The coronavirus is disrupting manufacturing in China. One toymaker says it might not have as many of its popular dolls this holiday season, and that's next.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>ASHER: Call To Earth, a call to action for the planet. This is CNN's commitment to engage our global audience in making a difference to protect the planet's future. As part of this commitment, we're introducing you to people and projects inspiring us all to answer the call. While in Davos last month, Richard Quest caught up with Topher White, a Rolex associate laureate, who created one solution to the challenges of climate change, and the extinction of endangered species by using old cell phones. He developed an alert system to detect illegal logging and poaching. Topher hopes this technology will help protect the world's rainforests.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOPHER WHITE, ASSOCIATE LAUREATE, ROLEX: Technology is an important part of helping fight climate change, helping to protect forests. And there's people around the world, if you give them the right tools, they will actually protect their own forests.</p><p>So, I'm Topher White from Rainforest Connection based in California. Growing up, I've always loved animals, you know, but I wanted to see them in the wild. Went out to Indonesia to volunteer for two weeks. This given reserved where they rehabilitate these Gibbons who have been in captivity and released them into the wild. But they were spending almost half their budget trying to protect this one area from illegal logging, a small area. And wandering through the woods one day with the founder, I stumbled upon somebody who's cutting a tree down, and thought that was kind of too bad that they couldn't really know what's happening in their forest.</p><p>There was no electricity, no roads, no running water, none of that stuff, but there were cell phone service. And so, I figured I could use these old telephones to listen to the forest and try and find out where the chainsaws were. We have these cell phones in a box with a microphone sticking out and some solar panels. And we can hear, you know, sounds that are happening up to a mile away, which is a huge area to cover the forest and the low sounds, the sounds of chainsaws, the sounds of vehicles, that actually travels better through the forest.</p><p>Well, the phones actually listened for everything. They listen to everything in the forest, and they send it over the cell phone network up to the cloud, up to our servers. And once it's up there, we use artificial intelligence even now to pick out anything but we're listening mostly for danger. So, chainsaws, logging trucks, gunshots, motorcycles, vehicles, humans talking, things like that things that don't belong in the forest. And once you hear those things, you can react to it.</p><p>Each phone we put up can hear things up to a mile away. That's the entire square mile of forest. Protecting over 2,500 square kilometers of forest, which is almost two-thirds of a million tons of CO2 that have been avoided in terms of deforestation through our partners. It's possibly the best and cheapest way to fight climate change today, protecting forests. These people on the ground will do it if you just give them the right tools and the encouragement.</p><p>[15:45:11]</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Once this sound has been heard, who's supposed to do what?</p><p>WHITE: There you go. That's the most important part, right?</p><p>QUEST: Well, of course.</p><p>WHITE: Technology on its own doesn't really make much a difference. So, we have to build these partnerships with local groups. So, like tribes, NGOs, governments, local communities, who commit to actually showing up and stopping these stuff. We're going to all these places where enforcing protection. And for us, that's an important part of what we do.</p><p>So, we have this whole like, you know, cycle of reaction where an alert comes in and they react. Every one of these Rangers, these like indigenous warriors out there with bows and arrows. They're actually a more impact of fighting climate change than like a dozen engineers in Tesla. They don't know it. Attention is what the difference is, the tension is what is the difference between a place being destroyed and places actually striving for generations to come.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: We'll continue showcasing inspirational stories like this as part of the new initiative at CNN. And let us know what you're doing to answer the call with the #calltoearth. You're watching CNN.</p><p>ASHER: Pick up any toy often you'll find the \"Made in China\" on the label. Iconic prop toys like Lego, Beanie Babies make at least some products in China. Hasbro, which makes Play-Doh manufactured 67 percent of its goods in the country last year. Now, as the coronavirus disrupts manufacturing, one company has issued a warning. Maker of the popular LOL Surprise Dolls said the slowdown may disrupt its supply this holiday season. Kristie Lu Stout has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Big eyes, crazy hair, and those layers and layers of packaging. For whatever reason, LOL Surprise is one of the most-coveted toys on the planet. But they could be harder to find this holiday season.</p><p>ISAAC LARIAN, CEO, MGA ENTERTAINMENT: There's going to be a major shortage of LOL come this holidays worldwide because of the coronavirus epidemic that we have right now.</p><p>STOUT: The coronavirus outbreak has sparked a health crisis and an economic mess. As it exposes major vulnerabilities in the global supply chain for all the sectors that reached deep into China.</p><p>[15:50:07]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Numerous companies, Apple another one, of course, impacted here.</p><p>QUEST: (INAUDIBLE) warning that the coronavirus outbreak --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Hyundai, the South Korean carmaker says as you said, that they are suspending production.</p><p>STOUT: Retailers are also feeling the impact, anticipating a supply slowdown. Amazon is stockpiling certain made in China products. In a statement, Amazon says, \"Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers.</p><p>LOL Surprise Dolls are designed by MGA Entertainment in California and made in China. The CEO says, before the outbreak, they produced a million dollars a day. Now, they were at a standstill, as China struggles to get back to work.</p><p>LARIAN: What people don't understand is that even if the factories open, they are not able to get all the workers back. And then, to make matters worse, what happens is that factory does need raw material.</p><p>STOUT: For multinational firms, this is not the first time their Asian supply chains have been tested. In 2011, the tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan hit the high tech supply chain, pushing back the launch of new devices. Later that year, devastating floods in Thailand rattled both the tech and auto industries as production stalled.</p><p>But the current crisis in China is different, given the unprecedented measures in place to stop the virus and the world's reliance on China as a manufacturing machine, China accounts for more than 80 percent of all global toy production. So, could the outbreak prompt a rethink about China as the factory of the world?</p><p>LARIAN: People were already thinking about their supply chains as a result of the trade war between the U.S. and China. And we're thinking about not being dependent so much on just one country. But the impact of this is much bigger than the U.S.-China trade war. And if this goes on for a long time, then companies will have to think about relocating their supply chain.</p><p>I don't think, frankly, any company is going to be able to replace China. China is the factory of the world. We have to accept it. We have to face it. They're great at what they do. They -- the quality, the discipline, the infrastructure, the workforce that they have. It's going to be years before somebody else can replicate.</p><p>STOUT: In the long run, the maker of LOL Surprise toys is hopeful for the future, but this year, he's bracing for a lackluster Christmas, a Christmas without enough of his toys under the tree.</p><p>LARIAN: It really makes me sad because, for us, the happiness, smile of children is magical, is so important.</p><p>STOUT: Smiles that may be harder to capture after the coronavirus. Kristie Lu Stout, CNNHong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Virgin Galactic shares are skyrocketing, as the company moves closer to launching a commercial space service. Shares are up more than 19 percent on Wednesday. Virgin Galactic stock has surged more than 200 percent this year, blowing past other top performers such as Tesla, and Sprint. Paul La Monica joins us live now. What do you make of this rapid, rapid rise, 200 percent in the past year?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is pretty stunning. And you could argue that this might be a bubble in the making, as I joked on Twitter, like if you scream bubble in space, does anyone here it? But that's a story for another day. I think, really, what's happening here, Zain, is that Virgin Galactic went public through this merger with a blank check company, and it allowed them to go public without the scrutiny that's usually attached to companies when they IPO through a more traditional way.</p><p>And to be fair, there's a lot of excitement about space travel and space tourism. It's a reason why Tesla announced a recent partnership to do something similar, as well. But the stock is now up, as you pointed out, 200 percent just this year, more than 50 percent, I think, or so in the past week is a bit insane when you consider that this is a company that's probably not going to make money anytime soon, because the cost of obviously, launching rockets into space is prohibitively expensive.</p><p>ASHER: So, the fundamentals don't justify it?</p><p>LA MONICA: At least not yet. I think that investors are of the mindset that at some point down the road, if you have well-heeled rich tourists that want to go into air -- go into space and orbit the Earth, that this is something where a business model might make sense. You have to pay a lot obviously upfront to get your rockets launched. But once you do so and have a sustainable group of customers paying extremely high fees to do this space tourism, then maybe it's a viable business down the road, but there's going to be competition. We pointed out that SpaceX, you could see some maybe from Blue Origin, as well, and that's backed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.</p><p>[15:55:06]</p><p>So, obviously, a lot of competition here, but Richard Branson has the leg up, at least in the public market, because he's public right now, and Blue Origin and SpaceX aren't.</p><p>ASHER: So, is -- I mean, is this stock just send -- your opinion and experience, is this stock overbought? And obviously that means, if it is, that means that short sellers in a way in the wings, looking at it -- looking at it as a, you know, potential target.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, you would have to think that short sellers will be circling around this company, particularly when they finally report their first earnings, following this merger into a blank check company that create the public entity in the first place. But again, I think that to be fair, investors are obviously taking the long-term view. You're not going to buy a company like this because you expect their next quarter to be good because their next quarter, they're going to lose money, and they're going to do that the next quarter after that, and that, and that. Because no one is expecting money to be made in 2020 or 2021, probably.</p><p>ASHER: Paul La Monica (INAUDIBLE) thank you. There were just moments left the trade on Wall Street. We'll have the final numbers and the closing bell right after this.</p><p>ASHER: There are just moments left to trade on Wall Street here about a minute and a half. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are on track to close at record highs. The Dow is still up not at a record high, though. Tech shares are the best of the day. Investors are betting on new stimulus from the Chinese government. Investors had also been watching for the new minutes from the Federal Reserve. They show policymakers believe rates will stay steady this year.</p><p>Let's take a look quickly at the Dow components. Apple is near the top of the pack after suffering losses on Tuesday, and that was because Apple had warned the coronavirus outbreak was hurting its supply chain. Boeing is up half a percent, even though the plane maker is reporting a new problem with the 737 Max.

Traders...</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes declined for the third straight week on falling tech giants and weakening economic data.  Mega-cap tech stocks led indexes lower as investors continued to shun lofty valuations and look for returns elsewhere.  Traders hoping for a stimulus breakthrough had little to cheer heading into the weekend. Democrats and Republicans remain hundreds of billions of dollars apart in their respective proposals.  The deadlock comes after weekly jobless claims and retail sales data pointed to a slowing economic recovery earlier in the week.  Watch major indexes update live here .   The S&amp;P 500 slid for a third straight week as sinking tech giants continued to pull major indexes from record highs.    Mega-cap companies including Apple , Microsoft , and Facebook led the slump once again. The market darlings have played major roles in recent weeks' declines. While crowding in the stocks helped drive the market's rapid rebound from virus-induced lows, investors have since shunned their sky-high valuations. As traders dumped the popular names, tech-heavy indexes tumbled just as quickly.   Oracle slid in Friday trading after the US government said it will block all TikTok and WeChat downloads in the country starting Sunday. The surprise announcement arrives as Oracle closes in on finalizing its partnership with TikTok-parent ByteDance. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. market close on Friday:   S&amp;P 500 : 3,319.43, down 1.1%  Dow Jones industrial average : 27,657.35, down 0.9% (245 points)  Nasdaq composite : 10,793.28, down 1.1%    Read more: Jefferies handpicks the 17 best stocks spanning multiple sectors to buy now \u2014 and details why each company's future looks 'particularly attractive,' even in a downturn  \"Mega-cap tech stocks are dragging everyone down right now,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said. \"The outlook is foggy for big-tech as the latest TikTok developments continues to add further strain to US-China trade relations and as Wall Street needs to start pricing in a Blue wave in November that would trigger higher taxes and tougher regulations.\"    All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors posted losses, though heath care stocks nearly avoided a downturn. Real estate and utility shares fell the most through the session.  Market participants continue to look for any sign of progress toward a near-term stimulus deal. Congress remains locked in negotiations over new spending as the pace of economic recovery slows. Indicators including jobless claims and retail sales showed mild improvement over the week, signaling the bump from March's CARES Act has largely played out. The Fed announced Wednesday it plans to hold rates close to zero until well into the US economic rebound. With monetary policy set to stay accommodative for years, all eyes are on legislators to reinstate aid programs including expanded unemployment benefits, economic relief payments, and small business stimulus.

Here are 7 reasons why the firm is bullish, and 5 stocks it recommends buying in advance    White House chief of staff Mark Meadows indicated on Thursday that the Trump administration is willing to back a $1.5 trillion bill. The target is higher than the White House's previous goal of $1.3 trillion, but Democrats and Republicans remain divided on a final figure and allocations for federal funds.  The stalemate follows weaker-than-expected readings for weekly jobless claims and retail sales earlier in the weak. Still, some indicators pointed to encouraging trends across consumers. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index gained to 78.9 in September from 74.1, hitting its highest point in six months. Economists expected a reading of 75, according to Bloomberg data.  Gold gained as much as 0.8%, to $1,960.14 per ounce, remaining in a narrow trading range between $1,900 and $2,000. Treasury yields wavered and the US dollar gained.    Oil prices slid on reports of exports resuming in Libya reignited fears of a supply glut. West Texas Intermediate crude fell as much as 1.6%, to $40.30 per barrel. Brent crude , oil's international benchmark, decreased 1.8%, to $42.53 per barrel, at intraday lows.

Support for regulatory action first gained steam last September when state attorneys met to discuss suspicions that conservative views were being suppressed on certain online platforms. In the discussions, officials argued the alleged issue was emblematic of a larger one, namely big-tech's market power and handling of personal data, issues they could look to combat through aggressive antitrust action. The companies most at risk - Alphabet's Google and Facebook have drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. </p><p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren was recently supported by Republican Senator Ted Cruz upon the announcement of a sweeping legislative regulatory plan that will explore the idea of regulating big-tech companies as public utilities. Learn the differences between the Dow Jones and the S P 500 A similar idea was originally put forth by Stephen Bannon, President Trump's former Chief Strategist. The rare bipartisan agreement could see legal action gain pace, particularly as politicians look to garner public support into election season. Such an outcome could pose a significant threat to Google and Facebook, two members of the FAANG group . S P 500 Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (January March 2019) (Chart 1) The group of tech stocks has offered robust returns for the year-to-date as tech tries to recapture its former glory from mid-2018. At present, FAANG has returned roughly 15% in comparison to the S P 500 which has climbed nearly 14% in the same span. Despite a disastrous performance last week, Facebook remains a pillar of strength in the group with an 18% return YTD. View our Economic Calendar for big events scheduled in the week ahead. Although the threat of antitrust action amounts to a significant risk for the tech-sector, adverse price action from the risk appears muted thus far. However, the threat could be weighing on a more determined drive higher, particularly for Facebook and Google. Given the nature of Washington and lobbying power of the industry, the threat looks to remain an ancillary risk for the time being. That said, state attorneys will meet on March 26th at the American Bar Association's spring meeting on antitrust. The FTC will also meet that week for a two-day hearing which has technological change, privacy and competition scheduled as major topics according to Bloomberg. Together, the meetings could see regulators find actionable steps forward but immediate price action for the S P 500 will arise from Wednesday's FOMC rate decision.

Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then. </p><p>                      The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets. The central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it. </p><p>                      The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160.35 points, or 0.6%, to 28,492.27 after fading back from an earlier gain of 302 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, fell 39.72 points, or 0.3%, to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%. </p><p>                      The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a closing record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits. </p><p>                      \"The era of easy money is here,\" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial. </p><p>                      Gold for delivery in December fell $19.90 to settle at $1,932.60 per ounce. Earlier, it had leaped to $1,968.80 after Powell began talking. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds. </p><p>Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5. </p><p>                      Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \"normal\" life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9% and United Airlines rallied 5.8%. </p><p>                      Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%. </p><p>                      Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN81063618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PN-16N1-JC8S-D37B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm\">speech</url>. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets. The central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160.35 points, or 0.6%, to 28,492.27 after fading back from an earlier gain of 302 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, fell 39.72 points, or 0.3%, to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%.</p><p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a closing record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.</p><p>\u201cThe era of easy money is here,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.</p><p>Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.74% after stocks stopped trading on Wall Street, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%.</p><p>Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, and the two-year yield held at 0.14%. The widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.</p><p>Gold for delivery in December fell $19.90 to settle at $1,932.60 per ounce. Earlier, it had leaped to $1,968.80 after Powell began talking. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.</p><p>Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/383eb8856eda415ed3a3b17894be035f\">layoffs</url> sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.</p><p>\u201cIt puts a spotlight on the heavy lifting the economy is going to need to get people back in the jobs market,\u201d said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street.</p><p>He said investors are still banking on Congress delivering another round of aid for the economy, which could include benefits for unemployed workers. Much of Congress' last round of stimulus has expired, and investors say a renewal is critical, though partisan disagreements have prevented a deal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary result that has to come out of Washington sooner rather than later,\u201d Loh said.</p><p>In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/a9ef11294c55f6fc8d130194dd507d0a\">shrank</url> at an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it\u2019s not as bad as the Commerce Department\u2019s earlier estimate of 32.9%.</p><p>Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/845debd14eda2f8b13f0eb84485c816d\">COVID-19 test</url>, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.</p><p>Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9% and United Airlines rallied 5.8%.</p><p>Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%.</p><p>Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%.</p><p>In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.</p><p>Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 55 cents to $$45.09 per barrel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm\">speech</url>. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets. The central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160.35 points, or 0.6%, to 28,492.27 after fading back from an earlier gain of 302 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, fell 39.72 points, or 0.3%, to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%.</p><p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a closing record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.</p><p>\u201cThe era of easy money is here,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.</p><p>Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.74% after stocks stopped trading on Wall Street, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%.</p><p>Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, and the two-year yield held at 0.14%. The widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.</p><p>Gold for delivery in December fell $19.90 to settle at $1,932.60 per ounce. Earlier, it had leaped to $1,968.80 after Powell began talking. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.</p><p>Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/383eb8856eda415ed3a3b17894be035f\">layoffs</url> sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.</p><p>\u201cIt puts a spotlight on the heavy lifting the economy is going to need to get people back in the jobs market,\u201d said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street.</p><p>He said investors are still banking on Congress delivering another round of aid for the economy, which could include benefits for unemployed workers. Much of Congress' last round of stimulus has expired, and investors say a renewal is critical, though partisan disagreements have prevented a deal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary result that has to come out of Washington sooner rather than later,\u201d Loh said.</p><p>In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/a9ef11294c55f6fc8d130194dd507d0a\">shrank</url> at an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it\u2019s not as bad as the Commerce Department\u2019s earlier estimate of 32.9%.</p><p>Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/845debd14eda2f8b13f0eb84485c816d\">COVID-19 test</url>, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.</p><p>Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9% and United Airlines rallied 5.8%.</p><p>Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%.</p><p>Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%.</p><p>In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.</p><p>Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 55 cents to $$45.09 per barrel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Stocks are pushing further into record heights on Wall Street Thursday, after the Federal Reserve made a major overhaul to its strategy, one that could keep interest rates lower for longer. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The S&amp;#38;P 500 ticked further into record territory on Thursday after the Federal Reserve made a major overhaul to its strategy, one that could keep interest rates low for longer. </p><p> The benchmark index rose 0.2%, to another all-time high, but it veered through a jumbled day of trading to get there. Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then. The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets. The central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160.35 points, or 0.6%, to 28,492.27 after fading back from an earlier gain of 302 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, fell 39.72 points, or 0.3%, to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%. The benchmark S&amp;#38;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a closing record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.  'The era of easy money is here,' said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.  Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.74% after stocks stopped trading on Wall Street, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%. (Ad) He says there's a huge new tech trend coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years. And today he's revealing the name and stock ticker symbol of his favorite way to make money from this trend.Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, and the two-year yield held at 0.14%. The widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.  Gold for delivery in December fell $19.90 to settle at $1,932.60 per ounce. Earlier, it had leaped to $1,968.80 after Powell began talking. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.  Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffs sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.  'It puts a spotlight on the heavy lifting the economy is going to need to get people back in the jobs market,' said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street. He said investors are still banking on Congress delivering another round of aid for the economy, which could include benefits for unemployed workers. Much of Congress' last round of stimulus has expired, and investors say a renewal is critical, though partisan disagreements have prevented a deal.  'It's a necessary result that has to come out of Washington sooner rather than later,' Loh said. In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrank at an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it's not as bad as the Commerce Department's earlier estimate of 32.9%. Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;#38;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.  Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to 'normal' life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9% and United Airlines rallied 5.8%. Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;#38;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%. Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%. In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.  Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 55 cents to $$45.09 per barrel.

Even the most venerable brokerage houses are encouraging their clients to actively trade so they can beat the market. Buy and hold is a relic, they say. It doesn't reflect the reality of today. In other words, 'this time it's different'. As the ongoing volatility in the market shows you, it's not different. It's not even close to being different. The simple fact is that many active traders lose money by being too aggressive and too active for their own good. And while it's true that the market won't always be this choppy, and certain stocks may be a great buy in months to come, right now investors are looking for safe harbors. One of the safest ways to invest is to find stocks that you can feel comfortable holding on to even in the worst of times. Frequently that can be because the stocks offer an attractive dividend. But sometimes, it's also because they are in a market that is always in demand. But that doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to defensive stocks. You can find some quality buy-and-hold stocks that offer some attractive growth prospects. View the \"10 Buy and Hold Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio\"[4].

The benchmark index rose 0.2%, to another all-time high, but it veered through a jumbled day of trading to get there. Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.    The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets. The central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160.35 points, or 0.6%, to 28,492.27 after fading back from an earlier gain of 302 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, fell 39.72 points, or 0.3%, to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%.    The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a closing record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.    \u201cThe era of easy money is here,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.    Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.74% after stocks stopped trading on Wall Street, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%.    Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, and the two-year yield held at 0.14%. The widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.    Gold for delivery in December fell $19.90 to settle at $1,932.60 per ounce. Earlier, it had leaped to $1,968.80 after Powell began talking. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.    Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffssweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.    \u201cIt puts a spotlight on the heavy lifting the economy is going to need to get people back in the jobs market,\u201d said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street.    He said investors are still banking on Congress delivering another round of aid for the economy, which could include benefits for unemployed workers. Much of Congress' last round of stimulus has expired, and investors say a renewal is critical, though partisan disagreements have prevented a deal.    \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary result that has to come out of Washington sooner rather than later,\u201d Loh said.    In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrankat an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it\u2019s not as bad as the Commerce Department\u2019s earlier estimate of 32.9%.    Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.    Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9% and United Airlines rallied 5.8%.    Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%.    Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%.    In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%.    In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.    Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 55 cents to $$45.09 per barrel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The benchmark index rose 0.2%, to another all-time high, but it veered through a jumbled day of trading to get there. Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.    The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets. The central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160.35 points, or 0.6%, to 28,492.27 after fading back from an earlier gain of 302 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, fell 39.72 points, or 0.3%, to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%.    The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a closing record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.    \u201cThe era of easy money is here,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.    Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.74% after stocks stopped trading on Wall Street, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%.    Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, and the two-year yield held at 0.14%. The widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.    Gold for delivery in December fell $19.90 to settle at $1,932.60 per ounce. Earlier, it had leaped to $1,968.80 after Powell began talking. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.    Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffssweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.    \u201cIt puts a spotlight on the heavy lifting the economy is going to need to get people back in the jobs market,\u201d said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street.    He said investors are still banking on Congress delivering another round of aid for the economy, which could include benefits for unemployed workers. Much of Congress' last round of stimulus has expired, and investors say a renewal is critical, though partisan disagreements have prevented a deal.    \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary result that has to come out of Washington sooner rather than later,\u201d Loh said.    In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrankat an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it\u2019s not as bad as the Commerce Department\u2019s earlier estimate of 32.9%.    Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.    Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9% and United Airlines rallied 5.8%.    Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%.    Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%.    In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%.    In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.    Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 55 cents to $$45.09 per barrel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

SpaceX will try again, Saturday afternoon, 3:22 Eastern Time.</p><p>Before leaving for Florida this morning, President Trump took direct aim at Big Tech in this country. President Trump is threatening to regulate, to even close down some social media platforms that he says are silencing conservative voices, and the evidence is on his side.</p><p>The President is angry and in my opinion, justifiably so. President Trump's warning comes only hours after Twitter slapped a fact check warning on two of his tweets about potential fraud involving early mail-in bail ballots.</p><p>The warning linking to fact checkers at leftwing fake news organizations -- if you can imagine this -- CNN, \"The Washington Post,\" who say the President claims are false. So, we have fake news claims about the President's assertions on Twitter.</p><p>Twitter, however, chose not to disclose that it is an active and premier partner, excuse me, of Vote Early Day 2020. It's an organization and advocacy group pushing early voting. That's right, exactly what the President opposes, and vote by mail.</p><p>President Trump is now accusing Twitter of election interference and stifling free speech, his own -- imagine interfering with the President's free speech rights.</p><p>\"Twitter has now shown,\" he tweets, \" ... that everything we've been saying about them and their other compatriots is correct. Big action to follow.\"</p><p>Big action was taken today by the Trump administration against the Communist Chinese Party. Secretary of State Pompeo notifying Congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous and no longer warrants special treatment under U.S. law.</p><p>This, as riot police in Hong Kong took a zero tolerance approach to new demonstrations on the streets. Our own Susan Li with more now from New York -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Lou, running street battles return in Hong Kong as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says that Hong Kong is no longer independent.</p><p>We have thousands turning out in Hong Kong on Wednesday to protest a controversial National Security Bill. If passed, Beijing would be able to write security laws for Hong Kong without any input from the city, a move that many residents say would be the end of Hong Kong as we know it.</p><p>Over 300 arrested. Clashes taking place between protesters and police in several of the city's main districts.</p><p>Meantime, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has alerted Congress saying that, \"After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States law in the same manner.\"</p><p>Now, remember that this was the underlying requirements in the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump last year.</p><p>If Beijing was deemed to be encroaching on Hong Kong's autonomy, the administration had a slate of tools to punish China, including sanctions, penalties and revoking visas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: Well, there's a whole menu of potential things that he could do, and I'm sure they're working right now on exactly how to refine the thinking and come up with something that's an appropriate response.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI: Now, speaking of response, China's propaganda arm, \"The Global Times\" tweeting about the U.S. response and the actions they may take, and they say, \"If Washington rashly takes actions over Hong Kong, it could accelerate U.S. decoupling with the rest of the world, impair the vast interests of U.S. companies in the city and thus, generate negative impacts for President Trump's reelection efforts.\"</p><p>Though China hasn't passed the National Security Law just yet, it is expected to and then we'll see what the President decides to do -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Susan, thank you very much. In short, there's not much it appears that the administration can do.</p><p>The Communist Chinese Party is spinning a new narrative about the origins now of the Wuhan virus. Chinese state media is saying the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan may not be the origin of the virus after all.</p><p>Scientists reportedly have discovered a new group of early virus patients in Shanghai that had no previous known connection to the market.</p><p>Other Chinese officials are also spinning up stories, maintaining that the virus did not originate in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but they have yet to say exactly where it did come from or that it even originated in China.</p><p>The fact is, the Chinese lies continue, their disinformation propaganda campaign only intensifies.</p><p>A Canadian judge today saying the U.S. extradition case against Huawei's Chief Financial Officer may continue. The judge found the case against Meng Wanzhou meets the threshold of double criminality, meaning the charges against her are crimes in both the United States and Canada.</p><p>The Trump administration wants her to stand trial on charges linked to violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran.</p><p>Well, joining us tonight to take all of this up is Gordon Chang, columnist, author, Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute. Gordon, let's start with the listening to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce talk rather gently around the answer, which is seemingly that the United States has very little it can do about Hong Kong, your thoughts?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: We have a lot we can do about Hong Kong. And it's not just revoking the sanctions waivers and the tariff waivers.</p><p>I think that we should look at Hong Kong in the context of China, of course, and China's attack on the United States is broad based. It's across the board.</p><p>So, our response should be across the board. And of course, our response on Hong Kong will be part of that. So, we should be looking at trade prohibitions, investment prohibitions, all the rest of this.</p><p>DOBBS: Okay, all the rest of this. I don't still understand what action we can take that will change the outcome in Hong Kong, based on what you talked about as broad options. What are they? What specificity? What is the penalty that would be exacted on China?</p><p>CHANG: Well, you know, you're right, that we can't stop the passage of the Article 23 National Security Legislation, but you know, we have all sorts of tools to get U.S. companies out of China.</p><p>So for instance, the President can use his broad authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, and that means that he could force companies effectively off Chinese soil, and we could stop investment into China.</p><p>Also, he could get companies like Google to end their partnerships with basically the Chinese military on things like artificial intelligence.</p><p>DOBBS: The question becomes, 100,000 Americans killed by the virus that originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and President Xi chose not to warn anyone in the world of the deadly contagion that they had unleashed.</p><p>Why would we be waiting to tell our companies to get out? Why would we be waiting to say this is an outrage against America and our national interest? Why would we not have already done so?</p><p>CHANG: Yes, we should have done that --</p><p>DOBBS: Because that is a greater crime, but proportionally, I'm saying to you, Gordon, that is a greater crime against America than what is being done in Hong Kong, as outrageous as it is.</p><p>CHANG: Well, you're absolutely right, Lou and we should be doing something immediately. And it was worse than Xi Jinping not saying anything about human to human transmissibility.</p><p>For a period of about five weeks, the Chinese leaders actually deliberately lied about the contagiousness of this disease and at the same time, they pressured countries to accept arrivals from China, not to impose those quarantines and restrictions.</p><p>And you put those two actions together, it shows that --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the finer -- yes.</p><p>CHANG: You put those two together --</p><p>DOBBS: To put a finer point on it, Gordon, what we're really saying is that the Chinese government sent their nationals who were sick and had been likely contaminated on international flights as they were shutting down domestic flights within China. The evidence speaks for itself.</p><p>The decisions speak for themselves. It was an outrage against the world.</p><p>CHANG: And it was more than just the mass worldwide killing that President Trump talked about. It actually is akin to murder. So, we have 100,000 Americans dead, and we cannot forget this.</p><p>And by the way, Lou, we've got to deter Chinese leaders from doing this again, because this is not the last pathogen that's going to be generated on Chinese soil.</p><p>Chinese virologists, actually, this last week said, there's going to be more of these outbreaks, which means we've got to make sure that we protect ourselves and because Chinese communism is unreformable, the only way to protect ourselves is to reduce our exposure to China, which means no trade, no investment, no tech partnerships -- no nothing.</p><p>DOBBS: And do you believe that the Trump administration is responding proportionally and correctly in this crisis?</p><p>CHANG: I think the Trump administration is moving as fast as popular opinion will let it. I believe though that we should be moving faster.</p><p>DOBBS: Oh, those are damning words, Gordon. Those are damning words. This President is not a politician. He is arguably the greatest President in our history and you're telling me that he is waiting on popular opinion to make decisions about national security and the national interest?</p><p>CHANG: He is moving faster than any President before him and that's important, because right now --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, no President before him, in all fairness, had 100,000 Americans dead as a result of the action of the Communist Chinese government, did they?</p><p>CHANG: No, they didn't, and we, Americans have yet to come to the conclusion that this was deliberate murder. But President Trump has been leading public opinion in that direction.</p><p>DOBBS: But what else could you call it? What else could you call it?</p><p>CHANG: I believe it's mass murder, because this was deliberate. When you look at the actions of the Chinese government, we of course, don't know what -- we don't know what was in Xi Jinping's mind. But if, after having seen what --</p><p>DOBBS: But who cares what was in his mind? Who cares what was in his mind? He made a conscious decision not to warn the world of the deadly contagion that the Chinese had unleashed. What more do you need to know?</p><p>CHANG: He actually lied. He lied. It was more than just not telling the world.</p><p>DOBBS: He did.</p><p>CHANG: He lied, and what I was saying Lou is that --</p><p>DOBBS: Any one of them is enough.</p><p>CHANG: Absolutely. This was murder.</p><p>DOBBS: Gordon Chang, good to have you with us. Good to see you.</p><p>On Wall Street today, stocks rallied. The Dow up 553 points despite rising tensions between the United States and the Communist Chinese. The S&amp;P up 44 points. The NASDAQ gained 72. Volume on the big board, 6.4 billion shares.</p><p>And crude oil down more than four percent to $32.82 a barrel.</p><p>A reminder to listen to my reports three times a day, coast-to-coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Up next, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is about to become a very important witness in Obamagate. We take that up and more with Congressman Jim Jordan. He joins us here next as we take up Twitter's established rampant anti-Trump bias and the Silicon Valley billionaires who want nothing more than to just help out poor Sleepy Joe Biden.</p><p>Sara Carter with those stories and more right after these quick messages, please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now, a number of Republican senators, RINOs all, writing to President Trump today, urging him not to restrict temporary work visas, which they say will actually help the economic recovery.</p><p>That is to say they are RINOs. They know nothing about economics and they're willing to lie to the President of the United States. Here they are. Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, Mike Crapo, James Risch, Mike Rounds, Todd Young, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan and James Lankford.</p><p>These senators know nothing about economics. They know nothing about the American people when almost 40 million American workers are unemployed within the last nine weeks alone. And these conscience-less senators have the temerity to write to the President asking them to bring in more foreign workers. The unemployment rate at 15 percent.</p><p>And I want to challenge any of these senators to come out of their shadows, step into our cameras and debate me on this issue. If you have any integrity, any guts, whatsoever, and I doubt very seriously that a single one of them will do so.</p><p>They're appalling, each and every one of them.</p><p>Well, breaking news tonight, tech billionaires, well, they're spending big money because that's their way, after all, they are billionaires. They want to help Joe Biden catch up with President Trump on his digital campaigning.</p><p>They include these Big Tech folks, LinkedIn founder Reed Hoffman, Facebook's co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, as well as Steve Jobs widow, Lauren Powell Jobs and former Google CEO, of course, Eric Schmidt, all wanting to help out Sleepy Joe.</p><p>Well, the Twitter official responsible for the platform's fact checking policy has a history of being anti-Trump, making anti-Trump comments, anti- conservative comments. His name is Yoel Roth.</p><p>He has tweeted in the past that there are, quote, \"actual Nazis in the White House\" end quote.</p><p>And quote, \"I'm just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.\" End quote. And this is just incredible.</p><p>Joining us tonight to take this up Sara Carter. She is investigative reporter, Fox Business contributor, Sara, great to have you with us.</p><p>SARA CARTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be with you, Lou. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Whatever makes you tick, it's not -- it is obviously not decency, and it sure is hell not neutrality or objectivity.</p><p>CARTER: No, absolutely not. You're 100 percent right. You could just see by Yoel Roth's, his own tweets that were never fact checked, by the way by Twitter, complete lies absolutely politically biased.</p><p>He obviously hates Trump. He hates the Trump administration. And we see this consistently that there's this bias on Twitter, Lou and on Facebook, and other media platforms like Google.</p><p>I've talked to insiders before that have said, we know it is happening. You know, we've reported on it. There have been whistleblowers, and unfortunately what we're seeing is these high tech companies with a lot of power, basically putting themselves into the middle of the election.</p><p>Now, it was Twitter and Facebook that actually said in the beginning, look, we need to do something. We need to stop fake news because of what happened with Russia.</p><p>But actually, they've invested more in getting involved in the election than we've seen from other countries.</p><p>For example, they did this to President Trump, right? As far as like fact checking his tweets about mail-in ballots, but they've never done that to China. They have never done this to Iran. They have never done this to Turkey.</p><p>When they put out these false tweets, basically targeting individuals and people, we saw that in Iran with Israel saying that Israel should be taken off the map, but Twitter never fact check them.</p><p>So, there's a serious problem here, and I think President Trump is right. We need to look into this. We need a White House panel to investigate this. And we need to hold Twitter and Facebook accountable because they're actually preferencing the Democrats in the upcoming election.</p><p>DOBBS: This is an outrage, an absolute outrage. The President has every right to be furious, and by the way, I'm not a fan of further investigation. This is on its face what it is.</p><p>I thought Donald Trump, Jr. got it exactly right with a tweet. This is what he tweeted, \"So is @Twitter going to start censoring and fact checking all the numerous blue checkmark, journalists and leftwing activists who falsely claim that the Trump Campaign colluded with the Russian government, and that @RealDonaldTrump is a puppet of Putin for the past four years?\" Sara, your thoughts?</p><p>CARTER: Right. Well, Donald Trump, Jr. is 100 percent right. How many stories have been out there that basically called out -- this is supposedly from \"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" supposedly trustworthy news sources, right?</p><p>For the last three and a half years to four years, they have been pushing stories that President Trump is The Manchurian Candidate, that he is actually connected to Russia.</p><p>Faults on their face. Faults on their face. They have never once retracted these stories, and Twitter has never corrected them.</p><p>So Donald Trump, Jr. is the absolutely right when he is doing this.</p><p>DOBBS: But you know what I hope we don't fall into, and it's one of the few times I would argue with you about anything but this idea of investigations, we know what they are, we know what they're doing. They have a public record. And they should be brought to heel.</p><p>They're not news organizations. They are, at best carriers. And it really must -- it really has to stop now. This is not something that can wait until after the election or -- it has just got to be dealt with.</p><p>And frankly, Dempsey and his crew are a bunch of leftwing, fill in the blanks, if you will. Sara, I appreciate you being here. We've got a lot of work to do in this country to straighten out Big Tech, but it is -- there's going to have to reckoning.</p><p>I thought Brad Parscale, the President's campaign manager was going to do that a couple of years ago. I guess he didn't get around to it.</p><p>Thanks so much, Sara Carter, as always, we appreciate it.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments and follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. Like me on Facebook. Follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>And Dr. Michael Pillsbury; investigative journalist, John Solomon among our guests here tomorrow evening. Please be with us for that.</p><p>And coming up here next tonight, President Trump says it's time to bring our soldiers in Afghanistan home. We take that up and much more, former Trump Deputy National Security Adviser Katie McFarland with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien dramatically cutting the size of the National Security Council staff.</p><p>O'Brien doing what he said he would do when he took the job. He expects to have only 105 staffers by the end of summer. That's more than half of the 240 staffers who worked at the N.S.C. under President Obama.</p><p>Women will also make up half of N.S.C.'s senior leadership for the first time in history.</p><p>U.S. troops in Afghanistan could be back home before the upcoming November election. Top military officials telling us that the President has given them orders to create numerous plans to withdraw all of our troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>There are currently fewer than 12,000 troops there, and the President wants them all home.</p><p>Joining us tonight is K.T. McFarland, former Deputy National Security Adviser to President Trump, author of the book \"Revolution: Trump, Washington, and We, the People.\" We recommend the book to you highly and commend K.T. as always for the book and delighted to have you with us, K.T.</p><p>First, Robert O'Brien cutting half the staff. He said he was going to streamline it and he has done precisely that. What is the effect of doing so?</p><p>K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I talked to him today, actually, Lou about this and other topics, and he's very happy to have finally been able to do it.</p><p>He is also, as you point out, he is very happy that the women on the staff make up 50 percent of the senior positions, and they're there on merit, not on tokenism.</p><p>And I think that what it'll allow him to do is really respond and give President Trump the kind of National Security Council he needs. You know, for the first year or two of the administration, I'm sorry to say that the National Security Council was really working at odds or many of the people were working at odds with the President's agenda.</p><p>I mean, they thought that President Trump should work for them, and that they would set the agenda not the other way around.</p><p>And with Robert O'Brien, he has now --</p><p>DOBBS: Or work for President Obama.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Oh, sorry. They worked for President Obama, right, they were the Obama holdovers. They certainly didn't think that they should be having to work for President Trump.</p><p>Well, anyway, now President Trump has the National Security Council he needs, which is very good, because, you know, every president should have a National Security Council that suits its needs.</p><p>President Trump, unlike a lot of other Presidents, he makes the decisions himself. He doesn't just pick option one, two or three that are sort of spoon fed to him by the bureaucracy.</p><p>So, I think now, he's got the right people in the right places. And I do think that American foreign policy and National Security policy will really quickly be able to implement President Trump's objectives.</p><p>DOBBS: Give us your sense, though, what is being projected from the White House right now? Because there is an incredible, I think, an unprecedented number of crises that are contemporaneous, whether it is the Wuhan virus, whether it is an intense disinformation and propaganda campaign by one of the principal powers of the world, and that is China.</p><p>At the same time, taking over Hong Kong because that's what it is. We all know it and we all might as well use plain English when we say it.</p><p>And there is here, a President that needs as much counsel, as much help and support as he possibly can get.</p><p>We are not necessarily hearing that there is some sort of perfect equivalency between taking the rights away from the citizens of Hong Kong and the loss of 100,000 American lives.</p><p>But we're not hearing that there will be a reckoning and an accounting and retribution for killing Americans consciously and doing so with absolute impunity.</p><p>MCFARLAND: You know, one of the things I did talk to Robert O'Brien about today was China, and he said that watch in the coming days -- days -- and coming weeks, that they're starting to roll out a policy, a comprehensive policy of dealing with China.</p><p>Just today, Secretary of State Pompeo designated Hong Kong is no longer an independent country. So, it has economic effects and trading effects and financial investment effects on Hong Kong, which will hurt China.</p><p>The second thing is, though, I think President Trump unlike the past two Presidents, unlike the entire Washington establishment, who for 20 years, put China's interests first and America's interest second, and in promoting China's interest it was often at the expense of America's interest.</p><p>I think President Trump has really changed the conversation in the country, and he has changed the direction of American foreign policy.</p><p>He is standing tough and standing tall against China. He did from the beginning, and I think that the coronavirus has really -- it really is a wake-up call. I mean, not to President Trump, he already knew there was a problem. It was a wake-up call to the rest of the world.</p><p>DOBBS: You call it coronavirus. The President called it the China virus. He called it the Wuhan virus, and even the Chinese called it the Wuhan virus, but we just heard you say coronavirus and we haven't heard the President use the expression, China virus when whether it's Ebola, whether it's -- you name the virus, they're all -- nearly all named for places.</p><p>But suddenly it's politically incorrect to call this the Wuhan virus. I am tired. I'm tired of thought control in the form of correct language.</p><p>This is what it is and Americans have been plainspoken, no one more plain spoken than this President. It disturbs me to see any retreat from that vivid and straightforward expression on the part of the White House.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Well, you know, I think that you've got a point in the sense of what are we calling it, because words do matter.</p><p>But when I look at what President Trump is doing, I think that the deeds that he's doing are really significant.</p><p>You know, in Washington, everybody says everything. They don't really mean anything, and they really never follow through with what they're talking about and promising.</p><p>And I think that President Trump has really been very different in that regard.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's conclude with a question and an answer.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Is Xi Jinping and the Communist Chinese government responsible for the deaths of 100,000 Americans?</p><p>MCFARLAND: Not only 100,000 Americans, but people all around the world. The Chinese shoes, the virus, whatever you want to call it.</p><p>DOBBS: I am going to be parochial, if I may, K.T.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Sure.</p><p>DOBBS: It is in your judgment, murder, I think so, too. I think it's odd that we --</p><p>MCFARLAND: I think it was a bio weapon that killed American people, and they are trying to kill the American economy.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, K.T., that's why you're welcome on this broadcast every day. We appreciate your straightforward insight and by the way, succinct answers as well from time to time.</p><p>K.T., thank you so much. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Thanks very much, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, what -- you bet. Good to see you. What will we learn from Rod Rosenstein about Obamagate? Congressman Jim Jordan joins us this evening on that and much more. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now. Lindsey Graham finally taking long promised action to investigate the radical Dems efforts to overthrow President Trump.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman announcing that former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify next Wednesday, that's June 3rd.</p><p>The hearing will take place one day before the committee votes on subpoena authorizations to compel more witnesses.</p><p>And here we go.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi moving ahead with a House vote tonight to reauthorize three expired surveillance programs. But it may have some trouble getting the 218 votes needed now to clear the chamber. Partly because President Trump urged Republicans to oppose the measure tweeting this, \"I hope all Republican House members vote no on FISA until such time as our country is able to determine how and why the greatest political, criminal and subversive scandal in USA history took place.\"</p><p>The Justice Department also weighing in today, saying President Trump should veto the bill if it passes, but this is an interesting piece of maneuvering on the part of the Justice Department.</p><p>Congressman Jim Jordan says he hopes to soon see the transcripts of Michael Flynn's phone calls with former Russian diplomat, Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the United States.</p><p>Those transcripts were declassified by the outgoing Director of National Intelligence, Richard Grenell. It's now up to the new Intel Chief, John Ratcliffe, to release those documents.</p><p>What will happen? Well, let's get the best view on that possible. Congressman Jim Jordan joining us tonight. Congressman Jordan is a Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee, also a member of the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Congressman, great to have you with us. Let's start with the House vote tonight on this Bill. This is quite a spectacle. The President not threatening to veto it, but calling on House Republicans not to support it.</p><p>But he didn't make a position known when you originally voted on the Bill. Give us some insight here.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Well, here's what's happening. Good to be with you, Lou. Here's what happened in the last two months.</p><p>So back when this first passed in March, since that time, think about what we've learned. We've learned 39 people unmasked Michael Flynn's name. We learned how they set up Michael Flynn.</p><p>We've got these transcripts that Mr. Grenell got released that show that when the whole Trump-Russia investigation started, there was no basis for doing the investigation, something you and I thought all along and knew all along, but now it's true.</p><p>Clapper knew and Brennan knew there was nothing there. Comey knew there was nothing there. So, all of that has transpired since then, and more importantly, we have the memorandum from Inspector General Horowitz, who is looking broadly at the FISA now.</p><p>First, he looked at what they did to Carter Page and the Trump campaign. Now, he is looking broadly at the FISA, and he put out a memorandum back on March 30th, which said, the 29 cases he has looked at, every single one -- every single one had major problems.</p><p>Four others, Lou, didn't even have what's called the Woods File, which is the file you have where you keep the main evidence, the supporting evidence, documentation for what you then take to the FISA Court.</p><p>So 29 American citizens who were spied on, every single one of those had major problems. So, that's all transpired since that first vote, and the President is simply saying, look, until we get this all figured out, we ain't reauthorizing anything. We're not doing it.</p><p>So God bless the President. This is a good product we've got working, but it can get better, and that's what the President wants to see happen.</p><p>DOBBS: I will second your God bless for this President because of what he has endured, all that he has done for the country, and then have to ask the Republicans to stop more of the madness.</p><p>I also don't quite understand the madness from the Justice Department, and perhaps you can give us some insight into that talking about given the cumulative negative effect of the legislative changes on the department's ability to spy, they want the President to veto it for an entirely different reason.</p><p>JORDAN: For a different reason.</p><p>DOBBS: What in the hell is going on at the Justice Department, Congressman?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, look at what the President tweeted out, though, just a few hours ago. He said, there should be no warrantless searches on American citizens and amen to that as well.</p><p>So, this President understands it and he has lived through it. Mr. Horowitz has given us the evidence and he had done the investigations that show just how bad it is.</p><p>So like the President said, let's get to the bottom of all of this before we reauthorize the program that was abused by Jim Comey's F.B.I. and the Intelligence Community in the Obama administration.</p><p>Hey, Lou, think about this. Six people in the Treasury Department were unmasking Michael Flynn's name, in the Treasury Department, six different people. Holy cow. What was going on in those last several weeks of the Obama administration?</p><p>We're now beginning to understand how determined they were to go after this President, how determined they were to cover up their scheme that they had back in their administration. And Jim Comey was the guy who was going to protect them because he was going into the next administration.</p><p>And then when he gets fired, Bob Mueller is going to protect them. But finally, we are getting the answers, getting to the details, getting to the facts, and that's why we're holding this up until we get a better product for the President to sign.</p><p>DOBBS: A better product. I like the idea that you don't sign a damn thing. There's no excuse to be spying on Americans for any reason and that crap has got to end. That's just one opinion.</p><p>JORDAN: Right opinion.</p><p>DOBBS: We're going to seek your opinion on what we're going to learn from - - thank you, sir. We're going to get your opinion about Lindsey Graham, sort of a, I guess he's an investigator now and he is going to have Rod Rosenstein before him.</p><p>We're going to get Congressman Jim Jordan's view of what we can expect. Stay with us. We'll be back with Congressman Jim Jordan, great American.</p><p>DOBBS: Former acting D.N.I. Ric Grenell setting former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power straight in one of his last acts, power claiming today Senator Marco Rubio has sounded the alarm about peddling Trump conspiracy theories, and how that does Russia's disinformation work somehow.</p><p>Grenell quickly replied, \"After spending years peddling a Russian collusion hoax, but under oath admitting you saw nothing, forgive us if we ignore your new so-called warnings.\"</p><p>We're joined once again by Congressman Jim Jordan. What do you think of the job Ric Grenell did as D.N.I.?</p><p>JORDAN: Amazing. I mean, three months -- compare three months of Ric Grinell with three years of Chris Wray. I mean, Ric Grenell got things done and he is right about Samantha Power and her so-called, you know, warning.</p><p>I mean, for goodness sake, they took a dossier to a secret court, a dossier they knew was false. They knew it was unverified. They knew it was paid for by the Clinton campaign. They knew it was Russian disinformation and they used that to get a warrant to go spy on President Trump's campaign.</p><p>And now they're lecturing us?</p><p>And then Jim Comey goes up to Trump Tower in early January in 2017 and tells the President about that dossier that he already knew was false and that he knew was paid for by the Clintons, that he knew was Russian disinformation, talks to the President about it so they can leak it and the press will report the fact that he's talked to the President about it.</p><p>And they want to lecture us so.</p><p>You can't make this stuff up and it is just ridiculous what we hear from some of these Democrats.</p><p>DOBBS: Ridiculous. Tragic. And how do the Democrats find so many creepy people to aggregate in one place in the swamp? It is just -- it is appalling. It's downright scary.</p><p>JORDAN: Thirty nine of them unmasking Michael Flynn, 39 of them unmasking Michael Flynn's name, too.</p><p>DOBBS: They apparently meant to get it done.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Rod Rosenstein, first witness before the long awaited Senator Graham committee, the Judiciary Committee. What do you expect to happen? What do you hope to see?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, no, I think it's great that Lindsey is bringing him in. You know, remember Rod Rosenstein was the guy who was there during that critical time in May of 2017.</p><p>Jim Comey gets fired on May 9th. Bob Mueller gets named special counsel on May 17th. Those eight days are critical because we deposed Jim Baker, the former Chief Counsel at the F.B.I., and Jim Baker told us in that eight-day time frame, the people at the F.B.I. were looking to -- Rod Rosenstein was looking to wear a wire to record the President of the United States.</p><p>Rod Rosenstein was looking to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the President from office. Rod Rosenstein was talking about -- and Andy McCabe and these guys were talking about an obstruction of justice investigation into the President.</p><p>And what they ultimately settled on doing, their course of action was to get Bob Mueller named as Special Counsel and Jim Comey leaked his memos to create the momentum to get Bob Mueller as the Special Counsel.</p><p>And two years later and $30 million and all the subpoenas, everything else they did, they came back with what they already knew. There was nothing there.</p><p>So yes, I think Rod Rosenstein is a good person to bring in right away, and let's find out what he knows about wearing a wire what he was doing about the 25th Amendment and these other issues that that came up in that critical, critical timeframe in May of '17.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you get the sense of Lindsey Graham this time means to actually find something out, because he went more than a year after promising to investigate the investigators? Of course, he has immediately ruled out any possible prosecution of President Obama or former Vice President Biden, strange ways to go, but then it is the Senate Judiciary Committee after all, your thoughts?</p><p>JORDAN: No, I do. You know, they're going to subpoena a number of people. I think that is real important. I keep coming back to this fact.</p><p>The insurance policy started off as the investigation itself. Once the President won the election, I think the insurance policy turned into, well, we've got to make sure Michael Flynn doesn't stay as his National Security Adviser in The Trump administration because he knows about Intelligence.</p><p>He might find out what we did. So, they get rid of Michael Flynn and Jim Comey is the guy who is going to travel into the next administration and protect him.</p><p>When he gets fired, it becomes -- Bob Mueller becomes the Special Counsel that becomes the insurance policy.</p><p>We've got to -- there's a lot of people I think we need to talk to. Lindsey is going to subpoena them all. And I think, make sure they come in and hopefully get to the bottom of all this.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, John Ratcliffe, you've worked with him, served with him in the Congress as the D.N.I., do you think that he will release those transcripts for General Flynn that were declassified by Ric Grenell?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, I think you will. I think John Ratcliffe is a good man. I think he's going to do the great work like Ric Grenell started there. I look forward to working with him.</p><p>I want that transcript between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak. I want the original 302. Remember, when Peter Strzok and Pientka go in and try to set up Mike Flynn on Comey's orders. There's the initial 302, the notes taken to that interview, and then it was changed by Peter Strzok.</p><p>So, I want to see the Kislyak-Flynn conversation. I want to see the original 302 and then I want to see the one that was doctored, the one that was amended and written by Peter Strzok. I want to see all three of those documents.</p><p>We have asked to get access to that as well from Christopher Wray, those 302s. We've also asked to make sure we get a chance to interview Mr. Pientka at some time. So hopefully we'll be able to get all of that information.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, great to have you with us. Very quickly, we're out of time, but does the vote fail or pass on the FISA reauthorization today?</p><p>JORDAN: I think it's going to lose because you're going to see the vast majority of us Republicans oppose it. And I think it's going to be tough to see if it passes.</p><p>The other interesting thing is I think there are 70 something Democrats, Lou, who aren't even showing up. They're mailing in the vote. They're phoning it in to a colleague via proxy and some colleagues are going to vote for them.</p><p>So it will be interesting to see how it all shakes out here in a few hours.</p><p>DOBBS: Better watch that mail-in vote there in the House.</p><p>JORDAN: No kidding. No kidding.</p><p>DOBBS: A lot of fraud associated with that.</p><p>JORDAN: Exactly right.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman Jim Jordan. Thanks for being with us. We'll be right back with much more. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump just moments ago tweeted he'll be in Florida for SpaceX's second effort to launch American astronauts into space, 3:22 Eastern, Saturday.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. Michael Pillsbury and investigative journalist, John Solomon among our guests here tomorrow. Please join us for that. Good night from Sussex.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2020052701cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-2721-JB20-G3GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Government expects a collection of EUR 1,818 million at both fees, below the estimated 2.050 million last year as a result of the economic slowdown.<br/>The new Tax on Certain Digital Services, known as<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Google fee',</emphasis>will predictably be taxed by companies with total annual revenues of at least 750 million euros and with revenues in Spain in excess of 3 million euros.<br/>The novelty that the Government has included is that, although the settlement of this tax will be quarterly, \"this year exceptionally will not be done until December 20 and this will give us a margin for negotiations at the international level and allow companies to adapt better,\" said the Minister of Finance, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero.<br/>In particular, in line with the proposal made by the European Commission at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">time,</emphasis>it will tax 3% of online advertising services, online intermediation services and the sale of data generated from information provided by the user during its activity or the sale of metadata. The Government expects to raise EUR 1.2 billion with this tax, the liquidation of which will be quarterly.<br/>In the Government's 2019 draft public accounts, the revenue estimate was EUR 1.2 billion with this tax, while now the Executive hopes to raise 968 million.<br/>The Government defends the creation of this levy because there are incomes obtained in Spain by large international companies from certain digital activities that escape the current fiscal framework, so they are making competitionunfair especially to small trade.<br/>The sale of goods or services between users under an online intermediation service is excluded from the tax; and sales of goods or services contracted online through the provider's website of those goods or services in which the supplier does not act as an intermediary. In addition, certain financial services are excluded from the fee.<br/>In addition, digital benefits that are made between entities that are part of a group with a direct or indirect share of 100% will also be excluded from the tax.<br/>The government's tax is similar to that passed by France last year and whose entry into force has sparked after reaching an agreement with the United States, which had announced the imposition of tariffs on French products on the grounds that this digital tax primarily penalized America's big tech giants, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google,</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook.</emphasis><br/>For now, the Gallic country defers the tax until one is paced internationally in the orbit of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OECD</emphasis> and the Trump Administration also cripples tariffs on French products. What is to be seen is how the United States will take this new tax in Spain and whether it will apply new tariffs on Spanish products, as it already did in the French case.<br/>Along with this tax, the Council of Ministers on Tuesday approved the bill creating the Financial Transactiontax, known as the 'Tobin rate', which will tax with 0.2% the transactions of purchase of Spanish shares executed by traders of the financial sector.<br/>Only 0.2% of the acquisition of shares issued in Spain of listed companies with a market capitalization of more than 1 billion euros will be subject to taxation. The purchase of shares of SMEs and unlisted companies will not be taxed. The taxable person is the financial intermediary who transmits or executes the purchase order, and must file an annual tax return.<br/>Debt, both public and private, and derivatives are outside the scope of the 'Tobin rate'. In particular, acquisitions that will be exempt from this levy include the operations of the primary market (ipode of a company), those necessary for the operation of market infrastructures, those of corporate restructuring , those between companies in the same group and temporary assignments.<br/>The Government estimates that it will deposit some 850 million for this new tax figure, which will be used to finance pensions and the social security protection system.<br/>Repeal of casualty layoffs<br/>The repeal of this article was announced by the Minister of Labour and Social Economy, Yolanda D\u00edaz, shortly after arriving in office and has been approved today after going through the appropriate administrative procedures.<br/>This article, which was amended with the 2012 labour reform, states that an employment contract may be terminated due to unassisted work failures, which are still justified but intermittent, reaching 20% of working hours in two consecutive months, provided that the total number of attendance failures in the previous twelve months reaches 5% of working hours or 25% in four discontinued months within a 12-month period.<br/>The abolition of 52.d comes after the Constitutional Court, in a judgment known at the end of October, endorsed the termination of the employment contract on objective grounds if there are justified but intermittent lack of assistance.<br/>What is approved today is the repeal of the article, not its modification or its replacementby other text. In this way, dismissal for accumulation of justified medical casualties will no longer be an objective cause for the dismissal of a worker.<br/>This does not mean that an employer cannot fire someone from his staff for lack of assistance or untimely, as he could argue this reason for carrying out what is known as disciplinary dismissal.<br/>The Minister of Labour has repeatedly stressed that the repeal of Article 52.d will be \"great news\" to stop living degrading situations in Spain and thus prevent a worker from losing his job while in a situation vulnerable.<br/>Union satisfaction and some criticism from the employer<br/>The repeal of this article has not been part of the social dialogue, although the minister did inform trade unions and employers of its approval. While CCOO and UGT have welcomed the adoption of this Royal Decree-Law, in some sectors of the CEOE it is not viewed with good eyes.<br/>The president of the trustee, Antonio Garamendi, has not been in front of the repeal of this article, although he has suggested that the first seven days of leave, especially in the case of SMEs, \"pay them for the Administration\". In his opinion, we should go much deeper into the issue of absenteeism \"because professional absenteeism is a reality in Spain\".<br/>For his part, the president of the Catalan employer Foment del Treball and vice-president of the CEOE, Josep S\u00e1nchez Llibre, has expressed his opposition to the repeal of this article.<br/>The Labour Minister believes that the business rejection of this measure is a minority and has made it clear that the Government has an obligation to legislate \"to correct what is already the source of European law\".<br/>More legal certainty in electronic services<br/>The Council of Ministers also approved, on a proposal from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, a draft law adapting national law to Community regulation to strengthen security in the use of certain trusted electronic services.<br/>These services include the signature and electronic seal of natural and legal persons or the electronic time stamp, which are commonly used in the telematic relations of citizens, companies and public administrations.<br/>The regulation provides for certain technical and internal organisational aspects to be established by the national legislature, regulating, inter alia, the verification of the identity and attributes of applicants for a qualified certificate.<br/>It also regulates the liability and risk forecasting regime of service providers, the maximum period of validity of the certificates, the time of retention of the service data, the legal effects of the documents where a qualified trusted service and a new sanctioning regime have been used, extended to all services that are trusted and appropriate to the European regulation.<br/>The project also appoints the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation as the body responsible for overseeing trusted service providers and building the list of trusted services.<br/>Spain is the country of the European Union with the largest number of qualified service providers, including the National Mint and Stamp Factory or the Directorate-General of the Police.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10880463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7R-8RC1-JBJN-M062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Even as the financial crisis raged, the former computer programmer has talked up the importance of upgrading the bank's systems. On February 20th, BBVA bought Simple, an American online-banking platform, for $117m, in a deal that hints at the potential for innovators to shake up retail banking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BBVA, with EUR607 billion in assets and 50m customers, believes that traditional banks will soon lose their monopoly on banking. In an opinion piece in the Financial Times last year, Mr Gonzalez warned that banks faced certain death unless they took on the likes of Amazon or Google. New entrants will not have the legacy costs of banks and can tempt clients with convenient mobile apps. He predicts mobile services could even triple the number of bank customers worldwide in the next decade.</p><p>Internet banking has had false starts before and thus far big tech companies have not really ventured into the low-margin, highly regulated and capital-intensive world of retail banking. True, non-banks have had some success in places like Kenya, which lacks an adequate banking network. And niche players like PayPal are thriving in payments. But their impact has been limited. \"I am dying to fund a disruptive bank,\" Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist, recently tweeted.</p><p>Banks have several lines of defence, says Jason Napier, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. They have millions of customers who tend to stay put. What is more, barriers to replicating technology are relatively low: cool new apps developed in Silicon Valley can be quickly copied by banks.</p><p>Still, he says a revolution is afoot, if not perceptible. As consumers do more banking on their mobile phones, visits to branches are falling. Simple says its clients login 2.4 times a day, on average. That compares with the mere handful of interactions most customers have with bank branches in a year. Its app allows users to work out how much it is \"safe to spend\" instead of simply providing a current balance. And it allows them to extract complex information easily by asking, for instance, how much they had spent on coffee and taxis in New York over the past month. Simple's base of young customers has grown by 330% in a year to 100,000.</p><p>If technology barriers are low, why didn't BBVA simply develop its own app? Time may be one factor. Another may be culture. Carlos Torres, head of BBVA's strategy and corporate development, says it is hard for a large organisation to replicate the entrepreneurial talent of an upstart. The Simple deal also suggests new entrants might still need banks. Simple itself is not regulated as a bank. Instead it places customers' funds with the Bancorp, which provides banking services to other firms. BBVA plans to move these funds to Compass, its American subsidiary.</p><p>The challenge for BBVA is to make Simple profitable. It plans to roll out new products, such as mortgages, in addition to the checking account that Simple currently offers. BBVA's focus will be on America where its retail business is still sub-scale. In time it hopes to introduce Simple in BBVA's core markets, including Spain and Mexico. It is not clear whether BBVA will eventually adopt Simple's technology for its own clients, or keep it independent.</p><p>For other lenders, upgrading creaky infrastructure to allow zippy functions along the lines of Simple's may be costly, but savings will come from fewer branches. And they still have the heft to buy pesky upstarts that threaten to disrupt them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20140301t1620000013xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FJH-YHF1-DYWT-T45X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2014 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

Instead, each fintech industry vertical is governed by the general legal provisions applicable to traditional players in that sub-sector.</p><p>One of the few exceptions is the regime applicable to equity crowdfunding and crowdlending platforms set out in the Law on Promotion of Business Financing (5/2015).</p><p>1.3 Which bodies are responsible for enforcing the applicable laws and regulations? What powers do they have?</p><p>The three main regulatory bodies that are responsible for enforcing the applicable laws and regulations are as follows:</p><p> the Bank of Spain, regarding banking activities and payment services;the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission (CNMV), with respect to investment services and issuance and trading of securities; andthe General Directorate for Insurance and Pension Funds, in relation to insurance activities.</p><p>In addition to their supervisory and sanctioning powers, these bodies may grant authorisations for reserved activities and pass technical regulations and guidelines.</p><p>1.4 What is the regulators' general approach to fintech?</p><p>Initially, the approach of the Spanish regulators to fintech was characterised by a lack of knowledge of certain business models and a lack of trust in these newcomers to the regulated environment.</p><p>However, as a result of the consolidation of the fintech sector and the steps undertaken in other jurisdictions, the regulators have become increasingly aware of the industry's potential to enhance competition in the financial markets and increase the efficiency of services for consumers.</p><p>This has led to the creation of specialised financial innovation departments within each of the regulators. The CNMV has also created a web portal specifically dedicated to consultations relating to fintech and innovation.</p><p>Finally, the effective implementation of the financial sandbox in Spain is also expected shortly.</p><p>1.5 Are there any trade associations for the fintech sector?</p><p>The Spanish Association of Fintech and Insurtech, which covers all industry verticals of both fintech and insurtech, is the most active association.</p><p>Other sectoral associations are also active in this regard, such as the Spanish Association of Crowdfunding, the Association of Crowdlending in Spain, the Spanish Association of Microloans and the Spanish Association of Tokens.</p><p>2 Fintech market</p><p>2.1 Which sub-sectors of the fintech industry have become most embedded in your jurisdiction?</p><p>All fintech industry verticals have evolved in Spain through the efforts of different national and international players.</p><p>The most embedded sub-sectors in terms of volume of activity and number of entities are lending (especially with regard to microloans), investment services (mainly roboadvisers and real estate crowdfunding), personal finance managers and payment solutions.</p><p>2.2 What products and services are offered?</p><p>Fintech companies in Spain offer a broad range of products and services, such as:</p><p> microloans;equity crowdfunding;crowdlending;personal finance management;comparison of financial products;automated investment advice or management;foreign exchange/securities trading;payment services;client online identification; andbig data related to the financial sector.</p><p>2.3 How are fintech players generally structured?</p><p>Most fintech players are start-up companies incorporated with limited economic and human resources, which generally have lean structures.</p><p>Nonetheless, more sophisticated structures are also in evidence in some of the most successful Spanish firms that have successfully raised larger amounts of funds, and in the neobanks and investment platforms launched by some incumbents.</p><p>2.4 How are they generally financed?</p><p>Initially, fintech players have been financed by private investors (eg, business angels, family offices) through investment rounds, some of which have used crowdfunding platforms.</p><p>Access to private equity funds has been more constrained, due to the legal restrictions on investment by such vehicles in the financial sector. This has also sometimes hindered the ability of fintech players to access public funding such as grants and soft loans.</p><p>More recently, the volume of investment channelled by banks through equity investments and incubators/acceleration programmes has also increased.</p><p>2.5 How are they positioned within the broader financial services landscape?</p><p>The position of fintech companies within the Spanish financial services landscape differs significantly from one sub-sector to another.</p><p>As regards lending, for instance, while microloan firms have gained significant market share, the market share of crowdlending platforms is still minimal.</p><p>Payment services offered by fintechs are also increasing as compared to those offered by banks - a trend which should be boosted further by the implementation of the second Payment Services Directive and the movements of big tech companies such as Facebook and Google.</p><p>By contrast, to date neobanks have gained market share only among specific client segments, such as millennials and frequent travellers, and as yet pose no threat to the incumbent entities.</p><p>The market shares of roboadvisers and equity crowdfunding platforms are also modest in comparison to the Spanish investment market as a whole.</p><p>2.6 Do start-ups generally outsource back office functions and is there a developed market for them to access? What are the legal implications of outsourcing?</p><p>Fintech start-ups generally outsource processes such as online client identification for know your customer purposes, collection and claims management and infrastructure development.</p><p>The main restrictions to outsourcing relate to the processing of personal data under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and associated local developments. Moreover, regulated credit entities operating in Spain are subject to specific requirements for the delegation of essential services and functions, and the technological providers of such services must cooperate with the regulators to facilitate the supervision of regulated entities.</p><p>3 Technologies</p><p>3.1 How are the following key technologies in the fintech space regulated and what specific legal issues are associated with each? (a) Internet (e-commerce); (b) Mobile (m-commerce); (c) Big data (mining); (d) Cloud computing; (e) Artificial intelligence; and (f) Distributed ledger technology (Blockchain, cryptocurrencies)</p><p>(a) Internet (e-commerce)</p><p>Internet (e-commerce) activity is mainly regulated by the Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (34/2002). This law broadly regulates services that are offered online, such as fintech services.</p><p>Under this law, the essential legal information that must be posted on company websites includes the company's cookie policy, privacy and data protection policy and legal notice. The website must also include the general conditions of service.</p><p>Specific legal issues in this regard relate to the existence of abusive contracts, with ill-defined terms and conditions, and cybersecurity crimes such as phishing, identity theft and information kidnapping.</p><p>(b) Mobile (m-commerce)</p><p>Mobile applications are governed by the same regulations applicable to e-commerce.</p><p>In addition to general risks discussed in question 3.1, legal issues concerning m-commerce arise from circumstances such as the following:</p><p> Mobile devices are always connected and in most cases logged into fintech applications, creating vulnerability to cyberattacks; andIf a password is lost or stolen, the information to reset the password is normally sent to the same device, increasing the risk of information theft.</p><p>(c) Big data (mining)</p><p>No specific regulation in Spain deals exclusively with big data. The most important regulation on this subject is the Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data and Digital Rights (3/2018), which implemented the EU General Data Protection Regulation in Spain - in particular, as regards the principles relating to the storage, processing, transfer and security of personal data.</p><p>The following legal issues are relevant in this field:</p><p> In most of cases the data used in big data processes is collected unlawfully and used without the knowledge of the data subjects, due to the fact that they do not know the terms and conditions under which their personal data is being processed.It is important to apply appropriate anonymisation and pseudoanonymisation procedures.</p><p>(d) Cloud computing</p><p>There is no special regulation on cloud computing in Spain. This notwithstanding, this area has many legal implications which are regulated by laws such as the Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, the Civil Code and the General Law for the Protection of Consumers and Users.</p><p>Likewise, since the most important legal implications relate to the storage, processing, transfer and security measures of personal data, the Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data and Digital Rights is also applicable.</p><p>The Spanish Data Protection Agency has published a Guide for Customers of Cloud Computing Services, to help ensure that customers are aware of their rights.</p><p>(e) Artificial intelligence</p><p>There is no specific regulation on artificial intelligence in Spain. As in the case of big data, given the relevance of the data to this technology, the Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data and Digital Rights is the most important regulation on this matter.</p><p>Legal issues in this field include concerns arising from the fact that, as part of an automated decision-making process, once data is used it is impossible to execute the subject rights recognised by the organic law.</p><p>(f) Distributed ledger technology (Blockchain, cryptocurrencies)</p><p>There is no specific regulation on blockchain or cryptocurrencies in Spain.</p><p>The most relevant issues to date concern investment in cryptocurrencies and the funding of projects through the issuance of tokens by means of initial coin offerings. These issues have been addressed by the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission and the Bank of Spain in certain warnings and guidelines they have issued.</p><p>4 Activities</p><p>4.1 How are the following key activities in the fintech space regulated and what specific legal issues are associated with each? (a) Crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending; (b) Online lending and other forms of alternative finance; (c) Payment services (including marketplaces that route payments from customers to suppliers (eg, Uber and AirBnb); (d) Forex; (e) Trading; (f) Investment and asset management; (g) Risk management; (h) Roboadvice; and (i) Insurtech.</p><p>(a) Crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending</p><p>The Law on the Promotion of Business Financing (5/2015) regulates equity crowdfunding and crowdlending activities.</p><p>Both businesses are considered reserved activities and, as such, their performance requires that so-called 'participatory financing platforms' obtain authorisation from the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission (CNMV). Furthermore, if such platforms intermediate the flow of funds between funding seekers and investors, they must also either obtain authorisation as a payment services firm or engage an authorised payment services firm for such purposes.</p><p>(b) Online lending and other forms of alternative finance</p><p>There is no specific regulation on online lending in Spain. This notwithstanding, the Law on Consumer Credit Contracts (16/2011) and the general consumer protection and e-commerce regulations apply to such activities.</p><p>Furthermore, certain court rulings have established restrictive criteria regarding interest on revolving credit loans and microloans based on the Law on Repression of Usury 1908.</p><p>On the other hand, invoice trading is not subject to the Law on the Promotion of Business Financing, which regulates crowdlending.</p><p>(c) Payment services (including marketplaces that route payments from customers to suppliers (eg, Uber and AirBnb)</p><p>Payment services are regulated by Royal Decree 19/2018 on Payment Services and Other Financial Measures, which implemented the second Payment Services Directive in Spain.</p><p>This legal provision recognises two new categories of payment services firms in Spain: account information services providers and payment initiation services providers.</p><p>Regardless of the fact that the requirements regarding security measures entered into force on 14 September 2019, the Bank of Spain has confirmed that it will grant an additional transition period for entities to adapt to them.</p><p>(d)  Forex</p><p>The foreign exchange (forex) industry is considered an investment service in Spain and, as such, is regulated by the Spanish Securities Market Law (whose consolidated text was approved by Royal Decree 4/2015) and the development legislation on investment services firms.</p><p>(e) Trading</p><p>Trading is an investment service which may be rendered only by banks and securities companies and securities agencies. Trading is also regulated by the Spanish Securities Market Law and the development legislation on investment services firms.</p><p>Social trading platforms may also be considered as a regulated investment service.</p><p>Binary options and financial contracts for difference have been subject to intervention measures pursuant to the CNMV Resolution of 27 June 2019.</p><p>(f) Investment and asset management</p><p>Investment advice may be rendered by any of the four classes of investment services firms, with financial advisory firms the simplest of these.</p><p>On the other hand, asset management entailing the creation of a client portfolio that is managed discretionally may be performed by any investment services firm other than financial advisory firms, with portfolio management companies the simplest of these.</p><p>These activities are regulated by the Spanish Securities Market Law and the development legislation on investment services firms.</p><p>(g) Risk management</p><p>Credit entities and investment services firms are obliged to have internal risk control departments; as a general principle, this task may be outsourced only to other regulated entities.</p><p>(h) Roboadvice</p><p>The development of automated advice and/or portfolio management activities entails the performance of a regulated investment service, provided that the advice activity refers to specific instruments and is made taking into consideration the personal circumstances of the investor.</p><p>(i) Insurtech</p><p>Insurance activities carried out by neo-insurers are subject to the Law on Ordination, Supervision and Solvency of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (20/2015).</p><p>The digital distribution of insurance products as intermediary (either as an exclusive or tied agent or as an insurance broker), and insurance comparison platforms and marketplaces, are subject to the Law on Mediation of Private Insurance and Reinsurance (26/2006).</p><p>Other insurtech sub-sectors, such as peer-to-peer insurance and crowdsurance, are not yet regulated in Spain.</p><p>5 Data security and cybersecurity</p><p>5.1 What is the applicable data protection regime in your jurisdiction and what specific implications does this have for fintech companies?</p><p>Fintech companies must abide by the Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data and Digital Rights, which means they are obliged to respect fundamental rights regarding personal data protection.</p><p>Certain particularities regarding credit information systems must be taken into account. First, fintech companies are obliged to inform the client in the event of a denial of service due to information obtained from credit bureaux. Second, they are also obliged to inform the client when payment defaults are registered with credit bureaux.</p><p>5.2 What is the applicable cybersecurity regime in your jurisdiction and what specific implications does this have for fintech companies?</p><p>The most relevant regulations with regard to cybersecurity include:</p><p> the Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce;the Law on Electronic Signatures (50/2003);the Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data and Digital Rights;the Law on General Telecommunications (9/2014);the Law on Retention of Data Related to Electronic Communications and Public Communication Networks;Royal Decree 381/2015, which establishes measures against illegal or irregular traffic which has fraudulent purposes in electronic communications;the Criminal Code;the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019; andthe Regulation on the Evaluation and Certification of Technology Security.</p><p>As a general principle, fintech companies must adopt special technical measures to manage, reduce and prevent incidences that may affect the security of the network and information systems that they use and provide.</p><p>6 Financial crime</p><p>6.1 What provisions govern money laundering and other forms of financial crime in your jurisdiction and what specific implications do these have for fintech companies?</p><p>The provisions regulating money laundering in Spain are the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (10/2010) and Royal Decree 304/2014 approving the regulations of Law 10/2010.</p><p>Fintech companies that carry out activities that are covered by Article 2.1 of Law 10/2010 (eg, lending or payment services) are covered by this regime, as well as by the criteria established by the Spanish Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</p><p>They must thus comply with obligations relating to due diligence, reporting and internal control.</p><p>These legal obligations apply to all entities covered by this regime that operate in Spain, regardless of whether this is through a subsidiary or branch or otherwise.</p><p>7 Competition</p><p>7.1 Does the fintech sector present any specific challenges or concerns from a competition perspective? Are there any pro-competition measures that are targeted specifically at fintech companies?</p><p>The Spanish National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) recently published its Study on the Impact in the Competition of the New Technologies in the Financial Sector (Fintech). In this document, the CNMC highlights that the fintech phenomenon requires a new regulatory approach and recommends, among other things, that regulation not hinder fintech innovations and be applied proportionally.</p><p>Furthermore, the CNMC is monitoring the market to ensure that traditional financial entities do not seek to protect themselves from the disruption caused by fintechs by creating artificial barriers to competition.</p><p>8 Innovation</p><p>8.1 How is innovation in the fintech space protected in your jurisdiction?</p><p>Most of the innovation in the fintech space relates to software development. In Spain, software is considered an IP right and is protected under the Intellectual Property Law (1/1996).</p><p>Moreover, as a result of the recent enactment of the Law on Trade Secrets (1/2019), software, code and algorithms, and commercial know-how will all benefit from broader protection in Spain.</p><p>8.2 How is innovation in the fintech space incentivised in your jurisdiction?</p><p>Innovation in the fintech space is incentivised mainly through the roll-out of multiple acceleration and incubation programmes by financial entities and private investors, and more recently through specific initiatives of the public administrations.</p><p>9 Talent acquisition</p><p>9.1 What is the applicable employment regime in your jurisdiction and what specific implications does this have for fintech companies?</p><p>The Workers' Statute is the main employment law in Spain. Nonetheless, the Spanish employment legal framework also includes a large number of national and regional regulations, collective bargaining agreements and criteria arising from relevant case law.</p><p>The labour issues that usually arise upon incorporation of fintech companies include:</p><p> the most suitable types of employment contracts (including teleworking contracts);the applicable collective bargaining agreement, depending on the company's main activity;the regulation of working hours;the applicable social security regime for key positions;post-contractual non-compete covenants; andminimum commitment agreements or golden parachutes in case of termination of the employment contract.</p><p>9.2 How can fintech companies attract specialist talent from overseas where necessary?</p><p>Spanish fintech companies usually try to attract specialist talent by leveraging on the country's general advantages: the Mediterranean lifestyle, an affordable cost of living, good flight connections, reputed business schools and tech clusters in big cities such as Barcelona and Madrid.</p><p>As most of these are start-up companies and cannot offer high salaries, they usually offer a package of flexible labour conditions (including teleworking and other benefits in kind). For key personnel, it is also common to grant stock options or other incentive plans.</p><p>10 Trends and predictions</p><p>10.1 How would you describe the current fintech landscape and prevailing trends in your jurisdiction? Are any new developments anticipated in the next 12 months, including any proposed legislative reforms?</p><p>Fintech companies are booming in Spain, in all verticals. Neobanks, real estate investment platforms, payment services providers (including account information and payment initiation) and blockchain ventures are leading the field today; although big data and artificial intelligence tools, together with regtech initiatives, may be the next big thing.</p><p>New developments anticipated in Spain over the next 12 months include the implementation of the Fifth Anti-money Laundering Directive, which will subject cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers to the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and its associated Royal Decree 304/2014. In addition, the sandbox for financial innovation should soon become a reality if, as expected, Parliament ratifies the draft government bill that regulates its creation.</p><p>11 Tips and traps</p><p>11.1 What are your top tips for fintech players seeking to enter your jurisdiction and what potential sticking points would you highlight?</p><p>Top tips for fintech players that are keen to start operating in Spain include conducting a thorough legal validation of their business models, to ensure that these will not require specific authorisations or registrations in Spain and will not be subject to particular local requirements such as anti-money laundering provisions. In the case of lending platforms, other business elements - such as default rates and recent case law - should also be assessed.</p><p>As regards the sticking points, business-to-consumer entities in particular are still struggling to gain market share, as the cost of acquiring clients and the difficulties in penetrate mature markets jeopardise their growth. Likewise, the levels of financing raised by Spanish fintech companies in comparison with their peers in other jurisdictions are still quite modest, since the local investment environment is limited and access to international investors is restricted to larger rounds and very successful stories.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)LISBON, Portugal (AP) \u2014 Spain's government approved Tuesday the introduction of new taxes on digital business and stock market transactions, following similar steps by other European countries. The Cabinet agreed at its weekly meeting to adopt the so-called Google tax and Tobin tax. The measures still require parliament's approval. Finance Minister Mara Jesus Montero said the Google tax, which has angered U.S. authorities and brought a threat of tariffs by the Trump administration, will be levied only from the end of the year.  By then, the government hopes an international agreement on digital business taxes will be in place. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which advises the world's rich countries on policies, is currently trying to draw up the agreement. Montero said the government wants a 'fairer\" tax system, adapted to the new economic trends of globalization and digitalization. Spain's Socialist-led coalition government is following other European countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, in adopting a digital tax.  The measure is an attempt to get around tax avoidance measures frequently used by multinationals. Big tech firms such as Google and Facebook pay most of their taxes in the European Union country where they are based and often pay very little in countries where they run large and profitable operations. Spain wants to place a 3% tax on online ads, on deals brokered on digital platforms and on sales of user data by tech companies that have a turnover of more than 750 million euros a year internationally and more than 3 million in Spain. It hopes to raise close to 1 billion euros a year in extra tax revenue. Other EU countries, such as France, Italy and Belgium, have already passed a Tobin tax. In Spain, the government aims to levy a 0.2% tax on share purchases involving companies worth more than 1 billion euros. That should raise more than 800 million euros annually, according to the government. (Ad) And Reuters magazine calls this type of trading \"the new baby boomer hobby.\" An anonymous trader -- living at the base of the Smoky Mountains -- just released a free report revealing a step-by-step system to generating an extra $5,000 per month in income thanks to this trading strategy. The report is free until Sunday. A Socialist government first said it wanted to adopt the new taxes in January of last year, but an April general election foiled its plans. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AMCN134119158203840879225876100189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIPR-134119</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7K-72Y1-F03R-N51D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><timeReceived>3:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>MarketBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;
