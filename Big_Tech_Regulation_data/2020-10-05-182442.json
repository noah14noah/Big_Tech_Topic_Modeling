Not quite, though pop culture decorations sure make it seem that way. The last Halloween full moon visible around the globe came in 1944, he said. He's written about the event on his web site, When the Curves Line Up. There was a Halloween full moon for some locations in 1955, but that didn't include western North America and the western Pacific, Hunt says. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday.

Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases.

One of the latter is called Lordstown Motors, and it debuted its Endurance pickup back in June. What sets Lordstown apart from its competitors is the fact that it's exclusively targeting commercial fleets as customers.</p><p>That strategy seems to be working because the brand announced on Wednesday that it had received approximately 40,000 preorders for the Endurance. Now, that may not sound like much compared to the half a million preorders that Tesla claims it has for the Cybertruck, but because they're commercial fleet orders, they might be more likely actually to turn into sales.pany Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: Fall Guys are apparently horrific, nightmarish monsters on the inside</p><p>The main characters in the extremely popular video game Fall Guys might look like adorable, oversize bean-shaped creatures, but apparently their insides look like a nightmare come to life.</p><p>Fans no longer have to imagine what the inside anatomy of the Fall Guys looks like.

The 2020 show, which was scheduled for late February, was one of the first major tech events to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. But while MWC 2020 didn't take place at all, the expectation now is that MWC 2021 will -- albeit with a delay.</p><p>With COVID-19 still circulating around the world, the show's organizers have decided to play it safe and schedule the show for next June instead of its usual February dates. In an announcement on Tuesday, the GSMA said the show would take place between June 28 and July. 1. A smaller, China-based event, MWC Shanghai, has been moved to take place in February.

This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants.

In the revealing documentary Oliver Sacks: His Own Life, streaming this week, he gets inside his own head, sharing the personal struggles that shaped him into a fearless student of the human experience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British doctor, whose memoir Awakenings inspired a 1990 movie of the same name starring Robin Williams, speaks with remarkable candor of the childhood fear that he might suffer severe mental illness like his older brother. He talks about shyness, self-doubt, insecurity and an amphetamine addiction that kept him awake for 36 hours at a time as a young physician. And he recalls the homophobia, from others and within, that haunted his whole life and psyche.

The film depicts a deeply empathic physician who believed in treating not just the disease but the entire person, and who shed his white coat whenever possible to interact with patients in their own environment. oliversacks-hisownlife-archive-photo2 Enlarge Image</p><p>The film intersperses interviews with archival photos and footage.

I need to know even more,\" says Robert Krulwich, co-host of the public radio show Radiolab, and one of more than a dozen subjects interviewed for the film.</p><p>That's a view echoed by Temple Grandin, the well-known professor and author who lectures widely on her life with autism and whom Sacks wrote about in a profile for The New Yorker and in his book An Anthropologist on Mars.</p><p>\"Oliver really got emotionally where I was at,\" Grandin says in the film. \"That he really, really understood.

Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth.

It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court.

Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month.

One of the latter is called Lordstown Motors, and it debuted its Endurance pickup back in June. What sets Lordstown apart from its competitors is the fact that it's exclusively targeting commercial fleets as customers.</p><p>That strategy seems to be working because the brand announced on Wednesday that it had received approximately 40,000 preorders for the Endurance. Now, that may not sound like much compared to the half a million preorders that Tesla claims it has for the Cybertruck, but because they're commercial fleet orders, they might be more likely actually to turn into sales.pany Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: Fall Guys are apparently horrific, nightmarish monsters on the inside</p><p>The main characters in the extremely popular video game Fall Guys might look like adorable, oversize bean-shaped creatures, but apparently their insides look like a nightmare come to life.</p><p>Fans no longer have to imagine what the inside anatomy of the Fall Guys looks like.

Not quite, though pop culture decorations sure make it seem that way. The last Halloween full moon visible around the globe came in 1944, he said. He's written about the event on his web site, When the Curves Line Up. There was a Halloween full moon for some locations in 1955, but that didn't include western North America and the western Pacific, Hunt says.

This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth. In 2019, it bought Double Fine, maker of adventure game Psychonauts. For more like this Subscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors' picks of the most important stories of the day.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events. GSMA canceled Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile show, a week before journalists were due to arrive in Barcelona in late February.</p><p>September 01: Events Calendar: Media Convergence Group Inc: Samsung, LG experiment with virtual demo rooms of the future amid IFA conference</p><p>Tech events so far this year have made something clear -- it's not tough for giants like Apple and Samsung to go all-virtual with their launches. But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday.

Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 24: Media Convergence Group Inc: Lordstown Motors claims it has 40,000 preorders, shows off its new interior</p><p>Source: ComElectric pickups look like they'll be big business with several brands -- both legacy and startup -- planning to offer them in the coming years. One of the latter is called Lordstown Motors, and it debuted its Endurance pickup back in June. What sets Lordstown apart from its competitors is the fact that it's exclusively targeting commercial fleets as customers.</p><p>That strategy seems to be working because the brand announced on Wednesday that it had received approximately 40,000 preorders for the Endurance. Now, that may not sound like much compared to the half a million preorders that Tesla claims it has for the Cybertruck, but because they're commercial fleet orders, they might be more likely actually to turn into sales.pany Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: A rare blue moon will bring a Halloween 2020 treat to the skies</p><p>In this bizarre year, another highly unusual event is headed our way. This year's Halloween full moon will be visible to the entire world, rather than just parts of it, for the first time since World War II, astronomy educator and former planetarium director Jeffrey Hunt says.</p><p>\"When I was teaching, my high school students thought a full moon occurred every Halloween,\" Hunt told me. Not quite, though pop culture decorations sure make it seem that way. The last Halloween full moon visible around the globe came in 1944, he said. He's written about the event on his web site, When the Curves Line Up. There was a Halloween full moon for some locations in 1955, but that didn't include western North America and the western Pacific, Hunt says.

The news comes as the Trump administration turns up the heat on big tech companies as the 2020 US presidential race gets into full swing.</p><p>Specifically, the new law if passed by Congress and signed by the president, would alter the criteria online platforms must meet to benefit from liability protections granted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>\"For too long Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. \"Ensuring that the internet is a safe, but also vibrant, open and competitive environment is vitally important to America.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: MWC 2021 rescheduled for late June to contend with COVID-19</p><p>Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile show, takes place every year in Barcelona, Spain -- every year except this year, that is. The 2020 show, which was scheduled for late February, was one of the first major tech events to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. But while MWC 2020 didn't take place at all, the expectation now is that MWC 2021 will -- albeit with a delay.</p><p>With COVID-19 still circulating around the world, the show's organizers have decided to play it safe and schedule the show for next June instead of its usual February dates. In an announcement on Tuesday, the GSMA said the show would take place between June 28 and July. 1. A smaller, China-based event, MWC Shanghai, has been moved to take place in February.

He talks about shyness, self-doubt, insecurity and an amphetamine addiction that kept him awake for 36 hours at a time as a young physician.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p>Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

Congratulations! You'll snag a PS5 on Nov. 12, when Sony launches its next-generation console. (If you didn't, you'll have a few chances between now and November to secure a unit. Best of luck.) But what games will you actually play on it? Sony recently announced juggernaut titles like God of War: Ragnarok, Final Fantasy 16 and Horizon Forbidden West. But those games are for 2021 and beyond (probably far, far beyond in Final Fantasy 16's case).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The PS5 has fewer games on day one than the Xbox Series X, but more PlayStation exclusives. Below are the games you'll be able to play on Nov. 12. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth. In 2019, it bought Double Fine, maker of adventure game Psychonauts. For more like this Subscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors' picks of the most important stories of the day.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events. GSMA canceled Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile show, a week before journalists were due to arrive in Barcelona in late February.</p><p>September 01: Events Calendar: Media Convergence Group Inc: Samsung, LG experiment with virtual demo rooms of the future amid IFA conference</p><p>Tech events so far this year have made something clear -- it's not tough for giants like Apple and Samsung to go all-virtual with their launches. But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday. It's Beijing's answer to the US government-owned GPS and will help the country reduce its reliance on American technology.</p><p>The satellite launch took place shortly before 10 a.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan province. The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 24: Media Convergence Group Inc: Lordstown Motors claims it has 40,000 preorders, shows off its new interior</p><p>Source: ComElectric pickups look like they'll be big business with several brands -- both legacy and startup -- planning to offer them in the coming years. One of the latter is called Lordstown Motors, and it debuted its Endurance pickup back in June. What sets Lordstown apart from its competitors is the fact that it's exclusively targeting commercial fleets as customers.</p><p>That strategy seems to be working because the brand announced on Wednesday that it had received approximately 40,000 preorders for the Endurance. Now, that may not sound like much compared to the half a million preorders that Tesla claims it has for the Cybertruck, but because they're commercial fleet orders, they might be more likely actually to turn into sales.pany Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: Fall Guys are apparently horrific, nightmarish monsters on the inside</p><p>The main characters in the extremely popular video game Fall Guys might look like adorable, oversize bean-shaped creatures, but apparently their insides look like a nightmare come to life.</p><p>Fans no longer have to imagine what the inside anatomy of the Fall Guys looks like. On Wednesday, Senior Concept Artist at Mediatonic Games Tudor Morris posted on Instagram his interpretation of the weird characters' insides complete with a skull with protruding eyeballs and an elongated neck.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: A rare blue moon will bring a Halloween 2020 treat to the skies</p><p>In this bizarre year, another highly unusual event is headed our way. This year's Halloween full moon will be visible to the entire world, rather than just parts of it, for the first time since World War II, astronomy educator and former planetarium director Jeffrey Hunt says.</p><p>\"When I was teaching, my high school students thought a full moon occurred every Halloween,\" Hunt told me. Not quite, though pop culture decorations sure make it seem that way. The last Halloween full moon visible around the globe came in 1944, he said. He's written about the event on his web site, When the Curves Line Up. There was a Halloween full moon for some locations in 1955, but that didn't include western North America and the western Pacific, Hunt says.

The news comes as the Trump administration turns up the heat on big tech companies as the 2020 US presidential race gets into full swing.</p><p>Specifically, the new law if passed by Congress and signed by the president, would alter the criteria online platforms must meet to benefit from liability protections granted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>\"For too long Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. \"Ensuring that the internet is a safe, but also vibrant, open and competitive environment is vitally important to America.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: MWC 2021 rescheduled for late June to contend with COVID-19</p><p>Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile show, takes place every year in Barcelona, Spain -- every year except this year, that is. The 2020 show, which was scheduled for late February, was one of the first major tech events to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. But while MWC 2020 didn't take place at all, the expectation now is that MWC 2021 will -- albeit with a delay.</p><p>With COVID-19 still circulating around the world, the show's organizers have decided to play it safe and schedule the show for next June instead of its usual February dates. In an announcement on Tuesday, the GSMA said the show would take place between June 28 and July. 1. A smaller, China-based event, MWC Shanghai, has been moved to take place in February.

He talks about shyness, self-doubt, insecurity and an amphetamine addiction that kept him awake for 36 hours at a time as a young physician.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p>Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes. CR has heard from travelers concerned about overcrowded flights and that mask requirements are not being enforced consistently.</p><p>CR urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials to establish requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel.</p><p>July 30: Consumers Reports investigation finds that the College Board is sharing students personal information with tech companies</p><p>Consumer Reports released findings from an investigation into the privacy practices of the College Board and found that the organization appears to be in violation of its own policies.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that the College Board is sending personally identifiable student information to major technology companies and ad platforms including Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and Yahoo.</p><p>\"College-bound students don't have any choice but to transact with the College Board-which is what makes these findings so concerning,\" said Ben Moskowitz, Director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. \"Because of its mission and its importance in the college admissions process, it is critical that the organization meet a high privacy standard, communicate clearly with its users, and limit the user data it shares with third parties for advertising purposes.\"</p><p>The College Board is a non-profit company that owns and operates the SAT test. The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation. For millions of students, the College Board is an unavoidable gatekeeper on the path to higher education.</p><p>After contacting the College Board with our findings, the organization made some updates to its site, but the underlying problem as found in the investigation remains.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 13: Consumer Reports launches petition calling for mandatory COVID-19 health and safety standards for airlines and airports</p><p>Consumer Reports is calling on Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to issue mandatory, enforceable health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it.

Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 23: Lack of key considerations in FDA food chemical safety process leaves consumers at risk of chronic diseases</p><p>(Washington, D.C. - September 23, 2020) Today, a group of health, environmental, and consumer organizations challenged the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) practice of not accounting for the cumulative health effect of chemicals in the diet when allowing new chemicals in food. Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats. The company responded by fixing the app.</p><p>The state's complaint says from 2013 to 2016 \"the Glow app had serious basic security failures that put its users' data at risk.\"</p><p>The $250,000 settlement also will require Glow to comply with state consumer protection and privacy laws, and what the state called \"a first-ever injunctive term that requires Glow to consider how privacy or security lapses may uniquely impact women.\"</p><p>Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports noted, \"Tech companies, especially those with a health focus, have access to incredibly sensitive information about consumers and too often fail to take the most rudimentary of protections. Especially with California's new privacy law in effect, the Attorney General's office is at the front line of protecting our privacy and security.

In a letter submitted to the OCC today, CR called on the federal regulator to protect consumers from high-cost loans by rescinding the proposal.</p><p>\"With so many Americans out of work and struggling to pay their bills, the last thing the OCC should be doing is making it easier for shady lenders to charge exorbitant interest rates,\" said Antonio Carrejo, policy counsel for Consumer Reports. \"Unfortunately, the OCC's proposal would enable predatory lenders to 'rent-a-bank' that isn't subject to state consumer protection laws and get away with peddling high-priced loans that trap borrowers in debt.\"</p><p>Rent-a-bank lending schemes typically involve partnerships between a national bank and a non-bank lender marketing payday loans, auto title loans, or auto installment loans. The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>September 02: Consumers Union: Blog: Consumer Reports calls on automakers to drop support for rollback of federal gas mileage standards</p><p>Consumer Reports continues to demand that automakers stop support for an initiative that will cause U.S.consumers to lose hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>Earlier this year, CR delivered a petition signed by over 75,000 consumers to the heads of several major auto manufacturers that are lobbying and suing to weaken federal fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>Today that message is being delivered again, as CR combines its petition with a coalition of consumer, climate, science, and faith advocacy groups in delivering a new combined total of over 285,000 signatures to the CEOs of General Motors, FiatChrysler, Toyota and other automakers supporting this rollback of fuel economy and emissions rules.

The chapter about maintenance cost is available for download as a PDF at the top of this page. The full white paper will be published in the coming weeks. For this report, 'vehicle lifetime' was defined as 200,000 miles. </p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

The bill (AB 1864) signed by Newsom will transform California's existing financial regulator into a more robust watchdog with broader authority and more resources to protect consumers.</p><p>California is strengthening state oversight at a time when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has scaled back its enforcement efforts at the federal level and reduced penalties on firms caught taking advantage of consumers. CR and a coalition of consumer and small business groups rallied behind the proposal given weak federal oversight and the heightened risk of financial exploitation that many Californians are facing during the current economic crisis.</p><p>\"Families hit hard by the collapse of the economy are prime targets for shady lenders and other unscrupulous financial firms,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager for Consumer Reports. \"California's financial watchdog will be equipped with the tools and resources it needs to protect communities from predatory financial practices and should serve as a model for other states.\"</p><p>Martindale continued, \"It's encouraging that California is strengthening its ability to stop financial fraud and abuse at a time when the CFPB is missing in action. No other state has empowered its financial regulator with such comprehensive authority and resources to protect consumers.\"</p><p>Under AB 1864, the Department of Business Oversight will be augmented and renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The new watchdog is modeled after the CFPB and is being funded using the Department of Business Oversight's existing reserve fund from past enforcement actions rather than money from the state's general fund.</p><p>The DFPI will have broad subject-matter jurisdiction over the financial services industry, including expanded authority to oversee important sectors that aren't currently subject to their supervision, such as debt collectors, credit reporting agencies and so-called \"fintech\" companies.</p><p>September 25: Consumers Union: California Governor Newsom signs student borrower protections into law</p><p>Californians with education debt will soon enjoy the strongest consumer protections in the nation now that Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law the Student Borrower Bill of Rights. The new law goes into effect on January 1 and aims to protect borrowers from loan servicing abuses that can make debts grow more costly and trigger defaults.</p><p>Consumer Reports co-sponsored the legislation with the California Federation of Teachers, NextGen California, Student Borrower Protection Center, Student Debt Crisis, and Young Invincibles. California's landmark new law was supported by a broad coalition of civil rights, higher education, and consumer advocacy organizations.</p><p>\"For most Californians, paying for college means going into debt that can haunt them for years before it is finally paid off,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager. \"Borrowers face a complex and confusing loan repayment system plagued by a lack of consumer protections and shoddy treatment that can add time and money to their loans.</p><p>Martindale continued, \"The Student Borrower Bill of Rights establishes the strongest standards in the nation to ensure student loan companies treat Californians fairly by acting in borrowers' best interests. California's comprehensive student borrower protections are a model for other states for holding loan servicers accountable when they mismanage accounts or engage in predatory practices.\"</p><p>Student loan servicers are the main point of contact for borrowers - taking payments, keeping account records and handling requests. In recent years, these companies have been the target state and federal investigations for abusive practices and mismanagement that have frustrated borrowers' ability to manage their loans, access legal rights to flexible repayment options, and stay out of default.</p><p>California's Student Borrower Bill of Rights (AB 376), introduced by Assemblymember Mark Stone, creates standards that require loan servicers to apply payments in a way that minimizes extra fees or charges, improve record-keeping, and train staff to provide borrowers with accurate information about their repayment options.</p><p>September 24: Consumer Reports survey finds that most Americans support government regulation of online platforms</p><p>Washington, DC - American consumers across the political spectrum are concerned about the increasing power and lack of accountability of online platforms such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, and a clear majority support some form of government regulation of the companies.</p><p>Consumer Reports conducted the nationally representative online survey of 3,219 adult U.S residents this summer to assess their experiences and opinions about online platforms.

While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes.

The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation.

CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public.

Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service.

Consumer Reports supported and provided input on the measure, which gained support from both consumer advocates and industry, and from California state legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>The measure would have required DTC genetic testing companies to obtain consumers' consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their genetic data, and to adopt security procedures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p><p>\"We're disappointed that Governor Newsom rejected this common-sense legislation. Privacy and security protections over this extremely sensitive data are sorely needed, especially in light of data breaches at several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies in recent years,\" said Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst at Consumer Reports. \"Without these protections, by default, California consumers' most personal information can be bought and sold to third parties without their knowledge.

Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>Marta L.

The chapter about maintenance cost is available for download as a PDF at the top of this page. The full white paper will be published in the coming weeks. For this report, 'vehicle lifetime' was defined as 200,000 miles. </p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

The report, \"Platform Perceptions: Consumer Attitudes on Competition and Fairness in Online Platforms,\" was issued by the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. Here's a look at the findings:</p><p>A majority of consumers-about 6 out of 10-support more government regulation of platforms (60%) and mandating interoperability features (61%) to deal with the growing power of large online platforms that may be hurting competition and consumers.</p><p>79% of Americans say Big Tech mergers and acquisitions unfairly undermine competition and consumer choice.</p><p>65% say platforms should be held accountable for the products and services sold on their platforms.</p><p>74% believe companies should be required to take more responsibility for evaluating information before it's shared on their platforms.</p><p>46% have difficulty distinguishing between what is a paid ad and objective search result, and 58% are not confident that they are getting objective and unbiased search results when using an online platform to shop or search for information;</p><p>85% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned about the amount of data online platforms store about them.</p><p>81% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned that platforms are collecting and holding this data about consumers in order to build out more comprehensive consumer profiles.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Consumers Union: CR Delivers 62,000 Petition Signatures To DOT Demanding Airline Safety Standards To Protect Passengers During COVID Crisis</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports delivered over 62,000 petition signatures to Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao today calling on her to establish mandatory health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus.

The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation.

CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public.

Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 23: Lack of key considerations in FDA food chemical safety process leaves consumers at risk of chronic diseases</p><p>(Washington, D.C. - September 23, 2020) Today, a group of health, environmental, and consumer organizations challenged the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) practice of not accounting for the cumulative health effect of chemicals in the diet when allowing new chemicals in food. Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

In a letter submitted to the OCC today, CR called on the federal regulator to protect consumers from high-cost loans by rescinding the proposal.</p><p>\"With so many Americans out of work and struggling to pay their bills, the last thing the OCC should be doing is making it easier for shady lenders to charge exorbitant interest rates,\" said Antonio Carrejo, policy counsel for Consumer Reports. \"Unfortunately, the OCC's proposal would enable predatory lenders to 'rent-a-bank' that isn't subject to state consumer protection laws and get away with peddling high-priced loans that trap borrowers in debt.\"</p><p>Rent-a-bank lending schemes typically involve partnerships between a national bank and a non-bank lender marketing payday loans, auto title loans, or auto installment loans. The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>September 02: Consumers Union: Blog: Consumer Reports calls on automakers to drop support for rollback of federal gas mileage standards</p><p>Consumer Reports continues to demand that automakers stop support for an initiative that will cause U.S.consumers to lose hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>Earlier this year, CR delivered a petition signed by over 75,000 consumers to the heads of several major auto manufacturers that are lobbying and suing to weaken federal fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>Today that message is being delivered again, as CR combines its petition with a coalition of consumer, climate, science, and faith advocacy groups in delivering a new combined total of over 285,000 signatures to the CEOs of General Motors, FiatChrysler, Toyota and other automakers supporting this rollback of fuel economy and emissions rules.

One of the latter is called Lordstown Motors, and it debuted its Endurance pickup back in June. What sets Lordstown apart from its competitors is the fact that it's exclusively targeting commercial fleets as customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That strategy seems to be working because the brand announced on Wednesday that it had received approximately 40,000 preorders for the Endurance. Now, that may not sound like much compared to the half a million preorders that Tesla claims it has for the Cybertruck, but because they're commercial fleet orders, they might be more likely actually to turn into sales.pany Website</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth. In 2019, it bought Double Fine, maker of adventure game Psychonauts. For more like this Subscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors' picks of the most important stories of the day.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday.

Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases.

On Wednesday, Senior Concept Artist at Mediatonic Games Tudor Morris posted on Instagram his interpretation of the weird characters' insides complete with a skull with protruding eyeballs and an elongated neck.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: A rare blue moon will bring a Halloween 2020 treat to the skies</p><p>In this bizarre year, another highly unusual event is headed our way. This year's Halloween full moon will be visible to the entire world, rather than just parts of it, for the first time since World War II, astronomy educator and former planetarium director Jeffrey Hunt says.</p><p>\"When I was teaching, my high school students thought a full moon occurred every Halloween,\" Hunt told me. Not quite, though pop culture decorations sure make it seem that way. The last Halloween full moon visible around the globe came in 1944, he said. He's written about the event on his web site, When the Curves Line Up. There was a Halloween full moon for some locations in 1955, but that didn't include western North America and the western Pacific, Hunt says.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p>Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

The bill (AB 1864) signed by Newsom will transform California's existing financial regulator into a more robust watchdog with broader authority and more resources to protect consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California is strengthening state oversight at a time when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has scaled back its enforcement efforts at the federal level and reduced penalties on firms caught taking advantage of consumers. CR and a coalition of consumer and small business groups rallied behind the proposal given weak federal oversight and the heightened risk of financial exploitation that many Californians are facing during the current economic crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Families hit hard by the collapse of the economy are prime targets for shady lenders and other unscrupulous financial firms,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager for Consumer Reports. \"California's financial watchdog will be equipped with the tools and resources it needs to protect communities from predatory financial practices and should serve as a model for other states.\"</p><p>Martindale continued, \"It's encouraging that California is strengthening its ability to stop financial fraud and abuse at a time when the CFPB is missing in action. No other state has empowered its financial regulator with such comprehensive authority and resources to protect consumers.\"</p><p>Under AB 1864, the Department of Business Oversight will be augmented and renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The new watchdog is modeled after the CFPB and is being funded using the Department of Business Oversight's existing reserve fund from past enforcement actions rather than money from the state's general fund.</p><p>The DFPI will have broad subject-matter jurisdiction over the financial services industry, including expanded authority to oversee important sectors that aren't currently subject to their supervision, such as debt collectors, credit reporting agencies and so-called \"fintech\" companies. It will be strengthened with dozens of new staff charged with actively monitoring the marketplace to identify patterns of abuse and to secure relief for consumers who are treated unfairly by financial firms.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

The new law goes into effect on January 1 and aims to protect borrowers from loan servicing abuses that can make debts grow more costly and trigger defaults.</p><p>Consumer Reports co-sponsored the legislation with the California Federation of Teachers, NextGen California, Student Borrower Protection Center, Student Debt Crisis, and Young Invincibles. California's landmark new law was supported by a broad coalition of civil rights, higher education, and consumer advocacy organizations.</p><p>\"For most Californians, paying for college means going into debt that can haunt them for years before it is finally paid off,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager. \"Borrowers face a complex and confusing loan repayment system plagued by a lack of consumer protections and shoddy treatment that can add time and money to their loans.</p><p>Martindale continued, \"The Student Borrower Bill of Rights establishes the strongest standards in the nation to ensure student loan companies treat Californians fairly by acting in borrowers' best interests. California's comprehensive student borrower protections are a model for other states for holding loan servicers accountable when they mismanage accounts or engage in predatory practices.\"</p><p>Student loan servicers are the main point of contact for borrowers - taking payments, keeping account records and handling requests. In recent years, these companies have been the target state and federal investigations for abusive practices and mismanagement that have frustrated borrowers' ability to manage their loans, access legal rights to flexible repayment options, and stay out of default.</p><p>California's Student Borrower Bill of Rights (AB 376), introduced by Assemblymember Mark Stone, creates standards that require loan servicers to apply payments in a way that minimizes extra fees or charges, improve record-keeping, and train staff to provide borrowers with accurate information about their repayment options.</p><p>September 24: Consumer Reports survey finds that most Americans support government regulation of online platforms</p><p>Washington, DC - American consumers across the political spectrum are concerned about the increasing power and lack of accountability of online platforms such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, and a clear majority support some form of government regulation of the companies.</p><p>Consumer Reports conducted the nationally representative online survey of 3,219 adult U.S residents this summer to assess their experiences and opinions about online platforms. The report, \"Platform Perceptions: Consumer Attitudes on Competition and Fairness in Online Platforms,\" was issued by the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. Here's a look at the findings:</p><p>A majority of consumers-about 6 out of 10-support more government regulation of platforms (60%) and mandating interoperability features (61%) to deal with the growing power of large online platforms that may be hurting competition and consumers.</p><p>79% of Americans say Big Tech mergers and acquisitions unfairly undermine competition and consumer choice.</p><p>65% say platforms should be held accountable for the products and services sold on their platforms.</p><p>74% believe companies should be required to take more responsibility for evaluating information before it's shared on their platforms.</p><p>46% have difficulty distinguishing between what is a paid ad and objective search result, and 58% are not confident that they are getting objective and unbiased search results when using an online platform to shop or search for information;</p><p>85% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned about the amount of data online platforms store about them.</p><p>81% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned that platforms are collecting and holding this data about consumers in order to build out more comprehensive consumer profiles.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Consumers Union: CR Delivers 62,000 Petition Signatures To DOT Demanding Airline Safety Standards To Protect Passengers During COVID Crisis</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports delivered over 62,000 petition signatures to Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao today calling on her to establish mandatory health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline.

The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation.

CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public.

Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 25: Consumers Union: California Gov. Rejects Bill that Protects Privacy of Californians' Genetic Data</p><p>California Governor Newsom today vetoed a bill (SB 980) that would have established strong privacy protections for genetic data collected by direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies like 23andMe. Consumer Reports supported and provided input on the measure, which gained support from both consumer advocates and industry, and from California state legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>The measure would have required DTC genetic testing companies to obtain consumers' consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their genetic data, and to adopt security procedures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p><p>\"We're disappointed that Governor Newsom rejected this common-sense legislation. Privacy and security protections over this extremely sensitive data are sorely needed, especially in light of data breaches at several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies in recent years,\" said Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst at Consumer Reports. \"Without these protections, by default, California consumers' most personal information can be bought and sold to third parties without their knowledge.

Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>Marta L.

The new law goes into effect on January 1 and aims to protect borrowers from loan servicing abuses that can make debts grow more costly and trigger defaults.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consumer Reports co-sponsored the legislation with the California Federation of Teachers, NextGen California, Student Borrower Protection Center, Student Debt Crisis, and Young Invincibles. California's landmark new law was supported by a broad coalition of civil rights, higher education, and consumer advocacy organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For most Californians, paying for college means going into debt that can haunt them for years before it is finally paid off,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager. \"Borrowers face a complex and confusing loan repayment system plagued by a lack of consumer protections and shoddy treatment that can add time and money to their loans.</p><p>Martindale continued, \"The Student Borrower Bill of Rights establishes the strongest standards in the nation to ensure student loan companies treat Californians fairly by acting in borrowers' best interests. California's comprehensive student borrower protections are a model for other states for holding loan servicers accountable when they mismanage accounts or engage in predatory practices.\"</p><p>Student loan servicers are the main point of contact for borrowers - taking payments, keeping account records and handling requests. In recent years, these companies have been the target state and federal investigations for abusive practices and mismanagement that have frustrated borrowers' ability to manage their loans, access legal rights to flexible repayment options, and stay out of default.</p><p>California's Student Borrower Bill of Rights (AB 376), introduced by Assemblymember Mark Stone, creates standards that require loan servicers to apply payments in a way that minimizes extra fees or charges, improve record-keeping, and train staff to provide borrowers with accurate information about their repayment options. It bans \"abusive\" student loan practices that take advantage of borrowers' confusion over the loan repayment process and establishes a student loan advocate to review borrower complaints, gather data, and issue reports to the state legislature.</p><p>For the 3.8 million student loan borrowers living in the state, the new law will provide much needed relief. Californians currently have over $147 billion in outstanding education debt with an average debt of $38,530. An estimated 508,520 Californians are behind on repaying their loans - and these numbers could dramatically worsen as the COVID-19 pandemic continues with no end in sight.</p><p>California previously enacted legislation requiring student loan servicers to be licensed and is one of 13 states that have advanced legislation in recent years to strengthen oversight of student loan servicers. States have been taking action since the Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos has refused to set loan servicing standards to protect struggling borrowers.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

The bill (AB 1864) signed by Newsom will transform California's existing financial regulator into a more robust watchdog with broader authority and more resources to protect consumers.</p><p>California is strengthening state oversight at a time when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has scaled back its enforcement efforts at the federal level and reduced penalties on firms caught taking advantage of consumers. CR and a coalition of consumer and small business groups rallied behind the proposal given weak federal oversight and the heightened risk of financial exploitation that many Californians are facing during the current economic crisis.</p><p>\"Families hit hard by the collapse of the economy are prime targets for shady lenders and other unscrupulous financial firms,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager for Consumer Reports. \"California's financial watchdog will be equipped with the tools and resources it needs to protect communities from predatory financial practices and should serve as a model for other states.\"</p><p>Martindale continued, \"It's encouraging that California is strengthening its ability to stop financial fraud and abuse at a time when the CFPB is missing in action. No other state has empowered its financial regulator with such comprehensive authority and resources to protect consumers.\"</p><p>Under AB 1864, the Department of Business Oversight will be augmented and renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).

While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes.

The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation.

CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry.

This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public.

Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 25: Consumers Union: California Gov.

Consumer Reports supported and provided input on the measure, which gained support from both consumer advocates and industry, and from California state legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>The measure would have required DTC genetic testing companies to obtain consumers' consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their genetic data, and to adopt security procedures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p><p>\"We're disappointed that Governor Newsom rejected this common-sense legislation. Privacy and security protections over this extremely sensitive data are sorely needed, especially in light of data breaches at several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies in recent years,\" said Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst at Consumer Reports. \"Without these protections, by default, California consumers' most personal information can be bought and sold to third parties without their knowledge.

Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>Marta L.

Consumer Reports supported and provided input on the measure, which gained support from both consumer advocates and industry, and from California state legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The measure would have required DTC genetic testing companies to obtain consumers' consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their genetic data, and to adopt security procedures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're disappointed that Governor Newsom rejected this common-sense legislation. Privacy and security protections over this extremely sensitive data are sorely needed, especially in light of data breaches at several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies in recent years,\" said Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst at Consumer Reports. \"Without these protections, by default, California consumers' most personal information can be bought and sold to third parties without their knowledge. We urge California legislators to take up this measure again in the next session, and for lawmakers in other states to pursue similar protections.\" </p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

The bill (AB 1864) signed by Newsom will transform California's existing financial regulator into a more robust watchdog with broader authority and more resources to protect consumers.</p><p>California is strengthening state oversight at a time when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has scaled back its enforcement efforts at the federal level and reduced penalties on firms caught taking advantage of consumers. CR and a coalition of consumer and small business groups rallied behind the proposal given weak federal oversight and the heightened risk of financial exploitation that many Californians are facing during the current economic crisis.</p><p>\"Families hit hard by the collapse of the economy are prime targets for shady lenders and other unscrupulous financial firms,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager for Consumer Reports. \"California's financial watchdog will be equipped with the tools and resources it needs to protect communities from predatory financial practices and should serve as a model for other states.\"</p><p>Martindale continued, \"It's encouraging that California is strengthening its ability to stop financial fraud and abuse at a time when the CFPB is missing in action. No other state has empowered its financial regulator with such comprehensive authority and resources to protect consumers.\"</p><p>Under AB 1864, the Department of Business Oversight will be augmented and renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The new watchdog is modeled after the CFPB and is being funded using the Department of Business Oversight's existing reserve fund from past enforcement actions rather than money from the state's general fund.</p><p>The DFPI will have broad subject-matter jurisdiction over the financial services industry, including expanded authority to oversee important sectors that aren't currently subject to their supervision, such as debt collectors, credit reporting agencies and so-called \"fintech\" companies.</p><p>September 25: Consumers Union: California Governor Newsom signs student borrower protections into law</p><p>Californians with education debt will soon enjoy the strongest consumer protections in the nation now that Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law the Student Borrower Bill of Rights. The new law goes into effect on January 1 and aims to protect borrowers from loan servicing abuses that can make debts grow more costly and trigger defaults.</p><p>Consumer Reports co-sponsored the legislation with the California Federation of Teachers, NextGen California, Student Borrower Protection Center, Student Debt Crisis, and Young Invincibles. California's landmark new law was supported by a broad coalition of civil rights, higher education, and consumer advocacy organizations.</p><p>\"For most Californians, paying for college means going into debt that can haunt them for years before it is finally paid off,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager. \"Borrowers face a complex and confusing loan repayment system plagued by a lack of consumer protections and shoddy treatment that can add time and money to their loans.</p><p>Martindale continued, \"The Student Borrower Bill of Rights establishes the strongest standards in the nation to ensure student loan companies treat Californians fairly by acting in borrowers' best interests. California's comprehensive student borrower protections are a model for other states for holding loan servicers accountable when they mismanage accounts or engage in predatory practices.\"</p><p>Student loan servicers are the main point of contact for borrowers - taking payments, keeping account records and handling requests. In recent years, these companies have been the target state and federal investigations for abusive practices and mismanagement that have frustrated borrowers' ability to manage their loans, access legal rights to flexible repayment options, and stay out of default.</p><p>California's Student Borrower Bill of Rights (AB 376), introduced by Assemblymember Mark Stone, creates standards that require loan servicers to apply payments in a way that minimizes extra fees or charges, improve record-keeping, and train staff to provide borrowers with accurate information about their repayment options.</p><p>September 24: Consumer Reports survey finds that most Americans support government regulation of online platforms</p><p>Washington, DC - American consumers across the political spectrum are concerned about the increasing power and lack of accountability of online platforms such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, and a clear majority support some form of government regulation of the companies.</p><p>Consumer Reports conducted the nationally representative online survey of 3,219 adult U.S residents this summer to assess their experiences and opinions about online platforms. The report, \"Platform Perceptions: Consumer Attitudes on Competition and Fairness in Online Platforms,\" was issued by the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. Here's a look at the findings:</p><p>A majority of consumers-about 6 out of 10-support more government regulation of platforms (60%) and mandating interoperability features (61%) to deal with the growing power of large online platforms that may be hurting competition and consumers.</p><p>79% of Americans say Big Tech mergers and acquisitions unfairly undermine competition and consumer choice.</p><p>65% say platforms should be held accountable for the products and services sold on their platforms.</p><p>74% believe companies should be required to take more responsibility for evaluating information before it's shared on their platforms.</p><p>46% have difficulty distinguishing between what is a paid ad and objective search result, and 58% are not confident that they are getting objective and unbiased search results when using an online platform to shop or search for information;</p><p>85% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned about the amount of data online platforms store about them.</p><p>81% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned that platforms are collecting and holding this data about consumers in order to build out more comprehensive consumer profiles.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Consumers Union: CR Delivers 62,000 Petition Signatures To DOT Demanding Airline Safety Standards To Protect Passengers During COVID Crisis</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports delivered over 62,000 petition signatures to Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao today calling on her to establish mandatory health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes. CR has heard from travelers concerned about overcrowded flights and that mask requirements are not being enforced consistently.</p><p>CR urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials to establish requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel.</p><p>July 30: Consumers Reports investigation finds that the College Board is sharing students personal information with tech companies</p><p>Consumer Reports released findings from an investigation into the privacy practices of the College Board and found that the organization appears to be in violation of its own policies.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that the College Board is sending personally identifiable student information to major technology companies and ad platforms including Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and Yahoo.</p><p>\"College-bound students don't have any choice but to transact with the College Board-which is what makes these findings so concerning,\" said Ben Moskowitz, Director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. \"Because of its mission and its importance in the college admissions process, it is critical that the organization meet a high privacy standard, communicate clearly with its users, and limit the user data it shares with third parties for advertising purposes.\"</p><p>The College Board is a non-profit company that owns and operates the SAT test. The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation. For millions of students, the College Board is an unavoidable gatekeeper on the path to higher education.</p><p>After contacting the College Board with our findings, the organization made some updates to its site, but the underlying problem as found in the investigation remains.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 13: Consumer Reports launches petition calling for mandatory COVID-19 health and safety standards for airlines and airports</p><p>Consumer Reports is calling on Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to issue mandatory, enforceable health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public. This news is especially welcome at a time when nonprofits are focused on meeting their communities' needs during the coronavirus pandemic.\" Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel for Consumer Reports.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 31: Zoom Makes Improvements to Privacy Policy after Consumer Reports Investigation</p><p>Yonkers, NY -Consumer Reports recently uncovered a range of privacy concerns with Zoom, a videoconferencing service that has gained in popularity as consumers, businesses, and schools have come to rely on the platform during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that Zoom, like many digital platforms, outlines in its privacy policy that it collects personal information about its users, but failed to disclose details about how that information is used for advertising, marketing, or other business purposes. Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 24: Consumers Union: Electric vehicle owners spending half as much on maintenance compared to gas-powered vehicle owners, finds new CR analysis</p><p>A new analysis by Consumer Reports finds that owners of plug-in electric vehicles are spending half as much on maintenance and repair as the owners of similar gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>Consumer Reports analyzed its 2019 and 2020 reliability survey data for thousands of electric and gas-powered vehicles, and found that drivers of electric vehicles are saving an average of 50% on maintenance and repair over the life of a vehicle compared to owners of gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>\"Electric vehicle owners don't need a coupon to get half-off typical maintenance and repair costs from their dealer, it comes standard!\" says senior transportation policy analyst Chris Harto, who authored the analysis based on CR's real-world data. \"These savings are going a long way to offset the upfront costs for consumers.\"</p><p>Average maintenance/repair costs over vehicle lifetime:</p><p>BEV (Battery-Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile ICE (Internal Combustion Engine): $0.06/mile According to CR's experts, simpler powertrains in EVs and no need for oil changes are likely reasons for the lower costs.</p><p>\"Electrics just don't need as much maintenance as gas-powered cars, and even though repairs won't necessarily be less expensive, they are less frequently needed,\" explains Gabe Shenhar, associate director of CR's Auto Test Center, specializing in electric vehicle testing.</p><p>September 24: Consumers Union: Electric vehicle owners spending half as much on maintenance compared to gas-powered vehicle owners, finds new CR analysis</p><p>A new analysis by Consumer Reports finds that owners of plug-in electric vehicles are spending half as much on maintenance and repair as the owners of similar gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>Consumer Reports analyzed its 2019 and 2020 reliability survey data for thousands of electric and gas-powered vehicles, and found that drivers of electric vehicles are saving an average of 50% on maintenance and repair over the life of a vehicle compared to owners of gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>\"Electric vehicle owners don't need a coupon to get half-off typical maintenance and repair costs from their dealer, it comes standard!\" says senior transportation policy analyst Chris Harto, who authored the analysis based on CR's real-world data. \"These savings are going a long way to offset the upfront costs for consumers.\"</p><p>Average maintenance/repair costs over vehicle lifetime:</p><p>BEV (Battery-Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile ICE (Internal Combustion Engine): $0.06/mile According to CR's experts, simpler powertrains in EVs and no need for oil changes are likely reasons for the lower costs.</p><p>\"Electrics just don't need as much maintenance as gas-powered cars, and even though repairs won't necessarily be less expensive, they are less frequently needed,\" explains Gabe Shenhar, associate director of CR's Auto Test Center, specializing in electric vehicle testing.</p><p>September 23: Lack of key considerations in FDA food chemical safety process leaves consumers at risk of chronic diseases</p><p>(Washington, D.C. - September 23, 2020) Today, a group of health, environmental, and consumer organizations challenged the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) practice of not accounting for the cumulative health effect of chemicals in the diet when allowing new chemicals in food. Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

In a letter submitted to the OCC today, CR called on the federal regulator to protect consumers from high-cost loans by rescinding the proposal.</p><p>\"With so many Americans out of work and struggling to pay their bills, the last thing the OCC should be doing is making it easier for shady lenders to charge exorbitant interest rates,\" said Antonio Carrejo, policy counsel for Consumer Reports. \"Unfortunately, the OCC's proposal would enable predatory lenders to 'rent-a-bank' that isn't subject to state consumer protection laws and get away with peddling high-priced loans that trap borrowers in debt.\"</p><p>Rent-a-bank lending schemes typically involve partnerships between a national bank and a non-bank lender marketing payday loans, auto title loans, or auto installment loans. The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>Marta L.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust is down 5.2% in the month. That's bad, even for a September.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 0.5%, on average, in September since 1950, says \"The Stock Trader's Almanac.\" And in election years, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped an average of 0.2% in September.

The Communications Services Select Sector SPDR Fund is down 7.1% in September. That's the second worst run of any S&amp;P 500 sector in the month.</p><p>Just two S&amp;P 500 sectors are up during the month so far: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-cheap-stocks-are-beating-fast-money-growth-ones/\">materials and industrials</url>.

Even after dropping 17.5% in September to 74.93, it's still up 63.4% this year. It also sports a perfect <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/\">IBD Composite Rating of 99</url>, meaning its chart and fundamentals top 99% of all companies'.</p><p>AMD is one of the stocks that's jumped so much in 2020, it's already bumping up against analysts' 12-month price targets. Analysts think AMD will be worth just 76.84 in 12 months, which implies just 2.5% in additional upside. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-buy-now/\">Do you know what to look at before you buy AMD stock?</url></p><p>It's a similar story with Apple. The stock is still up 45.5% this year, despite falling 17.2% just in September. Analysts are still bullish on Apple, though. Profit is seen jumping 9% in fiscal 2020 and 19% in fiscal 2021. And Apple carries a sky-high 91 IBD Composite Rating.</p><p>But the trouble is, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-how-high-can-apple-stock-go-who-profits-does/\">stock ran ahead too fast</url>. Analysts think the stock will be worth 119.02 in 12 months, not far from Friday's 106.84 close. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/\">Here's what you should look at when buying Apple stock.</url></p><h>Pain Outside Of S&amp;P 500 Technology</h><p>Amazon.com isn't a technology stock, per se. It's in the communications services sector. But it's been a leader all year. Until September. It's down 14.4% in September alone. Amazon, though, still, is up nearly 60% this year. You won't find many long faces, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/amazon-stock-get-rich-diversify-too-etfs-beat-apple-stock/\">given how hard it is to beat it</url>.</p><p>And in health care, Illumina continues to struggle with investors in September. The company, with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/illumina-ceo-followed-his-future-helped-human-health/\">long-history of top-notch management</url>, is down 17.3% during the month to 295.50. Shares are now down 11% this year as investors brace for profit this year to fall nearly 31%. Analysts, though, see profit rebounding 52% in 2021.</p><p>Will September's selling get worse?

You regularly run into aimlessly wandering participants who hope that a serendipitous encounter might show them the way to their next panel or revelation. Since everybody else is often equally lost, artificial intelligence in the form of chatbot 'Hibou' is supposed to help. But: Even the</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">machine</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">appears to not quite be on planet Davos. Ever since kindly announcing on Monday night that the welcome remarks would be delayed, it's gone mute. Even when prompted it offers no direction.</p><p>Humans</p><p>are left to their own devices, after all.</p><p>An uplifting speech by the Pope might help. Alas, he is not in attendance. But he doesn't have to be because</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi</p><p>held his speech for him. 'Only a</p><p>united people</p><p>can be successful,' as holy Sanskrit scripture declares, 'the whole world is a family'.</p><p>Conflict</p><p>can occur in the WEF family, too. As an unchallenged rumor has it, organizers had to hastily change the large interactive world map in the Congress Center to avoid a scandal: Because it displayed political borders that displeased the Indian delegation, they threatened Modi might cancel. Now the map lacks political borders, but the WEF has Modi. Why are we</p><p>fighting about borders</p><p>if we can just delete them?</p><p>'As a business leader I have a strong awareness that there is an impatience: That our current model of society is not inclusive, not sustainable, not inspiring.'</p><p>Co-Chair Isabelle Kocher, CEO Engie</p><p>In more than an hour of speaking, Modi managed to allude to plenty of Indian history and philosophy, but offered very few actual suggestions for</p><p>how to solve global challenges</p><p>. His retro speech ('In 1997, the last time an Indian Prime Minister spoke in Davos, almost no one knew of Osama bin Laden or Harry Potter') rode a reconciliatory wave, while India tries to reconcile its own struggle between economic and democratic liberalization.</p><p>Freedom of speech and of the press</p><p>have come under intense pressure during the Modi administration and civil society organizations are being threatened and isolated.</p><p>Gender equality</p><p>, too, is at times violently non-existent. A little side note: After my late night arrival at the hotel I ended up taking the elevator with a few members of the Indian delegation.</p><p>Man: 'What floor?'</p><p>Me: 'Third floor.'</p><p>Man: 'What room number?'</p><p>Me: Grad_Grad</p><p>On the other side of the feminist spectrum,</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</p><p>used his keynote address yesterday to call for a 'critical discussion on the power dynamics of gender,' challenging both business and political leaders to seriously tackle</p><p>systemic inequalities and sexual harassment</p><p>. He reminded the audience that 'recent estimates suggest that</p><p>economic gender parity</p><p>could add $1.75 trillion to the United States' GDP'. Even more impressively, in China the</p><p>GDP boost</p><p>could be as much as $2.5 trillion - 'that's</p><p>bigger than the entire Canadian economy</p><p>'. To top off his liberal victory lap, Trudeau also announced that in Tokyo today, the 10 remaining members of the</p><p>Trans-Pacific Partnership</p><p>agreed on maintaining their alliance after President Donald Trump pulled the US out of it. A clear mark in the Davos snow before the US delegation lands tomorrow night.</p><p>No one in an otherwise abundantly optimistic Davos discusses the next phase of the</p><p>Fourth Industrial Revolution</p><p>, which Germans call 'digitalization', without mentioning its key challenge: To include as many people as possible. To make sure that</p><p>more people gain work through artificial intelligence</p><p>rather than lose it. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam - all of them demand that more people receive support to</p><p>update their skills for the digital era</p><p>, when education and qualification are the lever of</p><p>personal welfare</p><p>. That's why Deutsche Post CEO Frank Appel is tired of another debate: The one about the blessing of Donald Trump's tax reform. While most American business leaders praise it, Appel maintains: The US is ditching a chance to partake in more technological progress. 'In the future, it's an increase in productivity that actually promises successful for an economy. And the way to get it is through better education. For which you need</p><p>money to invest</p><p>in.'</p><p>Digits of the day:</p><p>87 percent</p><p>of 1,600 top tier managers surveyed by Deloitte believe that the Fourth Industrial Revolution</p><p>will create more equality in the long-term</p><p>. But only 25 percent think that they can lead their own company through the changes.</p><p>In some discussion round the heads of big tech companies suddenly appear</p><p>humble</p><p>. The sound of</p><p>impending regulatory bells</p><p>ringing has grown so cacophonous in the last few weeks that they have to counteract in rhetoric. Confidence must be restored. '</p><p>Trust</p><p>has to be your highest value in your company. If it's not, you have a problem', says Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce. 'It's about</p><p>durable growth</p><p>and durable success. Short-term growth can be corrupted', seconds Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. And Professor Rachel Botsman opines: 'We live in an age of trust on speed. Convenience in many instances trumps trust.' Meanwhile, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's candidness was refreshing. Uber plans to elevate the role of</p><p>customer ratings</p><p>in the future. Nonetheless, Khosrowshahi grants that there are limits of a digital leap of faith: 'What's a rating about? It's about how you can drive, not about whether you're a serial killer.'</p><p>Advertising veteran Martin Sorrell insists on calling the tech industry the 'Fearsome Five'. And when it comes to governing the tech industry,</p><p>Europe is ahead of the US</p><p>, as a US journalist remarked with palpable respect. Whether or not Europe is in the lead in other ways might be a topic for discussion today: Heads of companies switch to listening mode and hand over center stage to Europe's heads of state. One after the other, Italy's Paolo Gentiloni, Germany's Angela Merkel, and France's new audience favorite Emmanuel Macron will be speaking here in Davos. Let's see if Europe is still ahead after that.</p><p>L\u00e9a Steinacker and I broadcast a</p><p>daily livestream</p><p>from Davos. You can find our recap of yesterday's First Day here:</p><p>We hope you can start your day with serenity!</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Miriam Meckel</p><p>Publisher of WirtschaftsWoche</p><p>Subscribe here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wiwo.de/serendipity-en\">www.wiwo.de/serendipity-en</url></p><p>Guten Morgen, liebe Leserinnen und Leser,</p><p>Information Overload</p><p>, das ist am World Economic Forum der Normalzustand. Regelm\u00e4\u00dfig trifft man auf planlos umherirrende Menschen, die hoffen, eine zuf\u00e4llige Begegnung werde ihnen den Weg zum n\u00e4chsten Panel und zur n\u00e4chsten Erkenntnis weisen. Da die anderen aber oft ebenso planlos sind, soll</p><p>k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz</p><p>in Gestalt des Chatbots 'Hibou' helfen. Nur: Richtig im Davos-Film scheint der auch nicht zu sein. Nachdem er Montagabend freundlich den Beginn des versp\u00e4teten Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsempfangs ank\u00fcndigte, blieb er seitdem stumm. Auch auf Nachfrage keine Orientierung. Wir sind als</p><p>Menschen</p><p>doch auf uns selbst gestellt.</p><p>Hier w\u00fcrde nun eine erbauliche Ansprache des Papstes helfen. Der ist aber leider nicht in Davos. Muss er auch nicht, denn seine Rede hat der</p><p>indische Premierminister Narendra Modi</p><p>gehalten. 'Nur ein</p><p>geeintes Volk</p><p>kann Erfolg haben', das stehe schon in den heiligen Sanskrit-Schriften, 'die ganze Welt ist eine Familie.' Auch in der WEF-Familie gibt es schon mal Stress. So sagt ein unwidersprochenes Ger\u00fccht, man habe die gro\u00dfe interaktive Weltkarte im Konferenzzentrum \u00e4ndern m\u00fcssen, um einen Eklat zu verhindern. Die indische Delegation war mit den dort eingezeichneten Grenzen nicht einverstanden und drohte mit Modis Fernbleiben. Jetzt hat die Karte keine Grenzen mehr und das WEF hat Modi. Warum streiten wir noch \u00fcber</p><p>Grenzen</p><p>, wenn wir sie einfach l\u00f6schen k\u00f6nnen?</p><p>'Als Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrerin ist mir deutlich bewusst, dass eine Ungeduld vorherrscht; dass unser aktuelles Gesellschaftsmodell nicht inklusiv, nachhaltig oder inspirierend ist.'</p><p>Co-Chair Isabelle Kocher, CEO Engie</p><p>In mehr als einer Stunde vermochte Modi sehr viel indische Geschichte und Philosophie, aber sehr wenig</p><p>aktuelle L\u00f6sungsvorschl\u00e4ge</p><p>f\u00fcr die Probleme der Welt unterzubringen. Seine Retro-Rede ('1997, als zuletzt ein indischer Premierminister in Davos gesprochen hat, kannte kaum jemand Osama bin Laden oder Harry Potter'), trieb auf der Welle einer Vers\u00f6hnung, w\u00e4hrend Indien selbst durchaus mit sich und einem Twist zwischen wirtschaftlicher und demokratischer Liberalisierung ringt.

In seiner Keynote forderte der kanadische Premierminister Justin Trudeau, es m\u00fcsse endlich eine Diskussion \u00fcber die</p><p>Machtverh\u00e4ltnisse der Geschlechter</p><p>geben. Kleine Erinnerung: Eine</p><p>wirtschaftliche Gleichstellung</p><p>von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern w\u00fcrde den USA ein Plus von</p><p>1,75 Billionen Dollar f\u00fcr ihr Bruttoinlandsprodukt</p><p>bescheren. China n\u00e4hme einen noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Schwung: plus 2,5 Billionen Dollar. Das ist mehr als das gesamte Bruttoinlandsprodukt Kanadas. Trudeau k\u00fcrte seinen liberalen verbalen Triumphzug mit der Ansage, dass die zehn verbleibenden Mitglieder des</p><p>Transpazifischen Partnerschafts-Abkommens</p><p>sich in Tokyo geeinigt haben zusammen zu bleiben - auch nach dem Ausscheiden von US Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump. Das war die vorauseilende Gru\u00dfbotschaft aus dem Davoser Schnee vor der morgigen Ankunft der US Delegation.</p><p>Eigentlich niemand im ansonsten so optimistischen Davos spricht \u00fcber die n\u00e4chste Stufe der</p><p>vierten industriellen Revolution</p><p>, die die Deutschen Digitalisierung nennen, ohne auf die Schl\u00fcssel-Herausforderung zu verweisen: so viele Menschen wie m\u00f6glich mitzunehmen. Also daf\u00fcr zu sorgen, dass</p><p>durch k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz mehr Menschen Arbeit finden als verlieren</p><p>.

Genau deswegen geht Deutsche Post-Chef Frank Appel eine andere Debatte auf die Nerven - die um den Segen der Steuerreform von US-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump. W\u00e4hrend die meisten US-Manager in Davos diese loben, findet Appel: Die USA verspielen eine Chance auf mehr Teilhabe am technischen Fortschritt.

'Es geht um</p><p>dauerhaftes Wachstum</p><p>und dauerhaften Erfolg. Kurzfristiger Erfolg kann korrumpiert werden,' sekundiert Ruth Porat, Finanzchefin von Alphabet/Google. Und die Professorin Rachel Botsman meint: 'Wir leben in einem Zeitalter des Vertrauens auf Speed. Die Bequemlichkeit \u00fcbertrumpft in vielen Momenten das Vertrauen.' Sehr erfrischend war da die offenherzige Aussage von Uber-Chef Dara Khosrowshahi. Uber will k\u00fcnftig mehr aus den</p><p>Kundenratings</p><p>machen.

My name is Brent Thill. I am responsible for the software research initiative at UBS. Thanks for joining us today. We're really excited to have you at Cavallo Point. This is a unique setting. Sorry we don't have a better view of the Golden Gate Bridge this morning, but I think you will be able to see it later in the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After multiple months with no rain, it had to come right during our conference, so I apologize for that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But on a brighter note, we have Frank Slootman, CEO, and Mike Scarpelli, CFO, of ServiceNow. Many of you have heard this story, but I think it's one of the more unique stories in our space, and they're really redefining a really new opportunity that we think is extremely exciting. Both Frank and Mike, obviously, were at Data Domain before they joined ServiceNow, so they worked together in the past and worked very well together, as you'll see on this presentation.</p><p>We are going to turn it over to Frank for just a few opening remarks, and then we will go to Q&amp;A and we will take Q&amp;A from all of you. If there is anything we can do for you during the day, please don't hesitate to reach out. There is no request that we can't handle.</p><p>We will have the ServiceNow self-service portal outside here to help, too. We can route the request, and then Kirsten Parker is running our tech initiative from the distribution side, if you raise your hand, get to know her. She is based in London and is responsible for all of our tech products, so I want to make sure we highlighted her work here today as well.</p><p>Thanks, and Frank, we appreciate you being here.</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO, SERVICENOW, INC.: Yes, so good morning, everybody. Do a little bit of prepared remarks here for those of you that don't know the story very well or you are just getting acquainted, some things that we really want you to take away, and then all the Q&amp;A part will be a little bit more pointed for those of you who have been following us a lot more closely.</p><p>Safely into harbor, thank you. Our starting point is always, with ServiceNow, is that we bill ourselves as the enterprise IT cloud. As you know, Salesforce, sales and marketing clouds; Workday and HR clouds; NetSuite, finance clouds. Lots of marketing clouds out there.</p><p>We are that one company that is squarely focused on the enterprise IT audience. That is our constituency. We always tell IT audiences, IT is our home and you guys are our homies, and it's really important because that's the advocacy that we leverage inside the enterprise.</p><p>The second thing is this is a very high-growth enterprise. Literally out of the gate, the Company bootstrapped itself back in 2004 with less than $10 million in capital and never looked back, and on the compound annual basis, has been growing, has been doubling in size literally every year. Even in our most recent quarter, on a revenue basis year on year, it was 73% growth. So it takes a lot to grow at that rate, and I will emphasize it a little bit more.</p><p>Final point here, we did move our head office to Silicon Valley. We are originally a San Diego company. We have been in San Diego for a long time, but we have now really spread out the West Coast. We are in Seattle now. We have several hundred people in our new head office in Santa Clara, right here on 101.</p><p>Now, the takeaways. The first thing that we emphasize about ourselves is that even though we go to market with a portfolio of applications, we are fundamentally a software platform company and the applications are built on our platform. The platform is really the power behind the throne. It is what enables -- it is what allows applications to be built very, very quickly, really orders of magnitude faster than what people have historically been able to do. And that's why the name of the Company is ServiceNow, not later.</p><p>Also, this system was built in such a way that applications can very, very quickly morph and change. They are super dynamic. What is important about that is that you don't have to get it right up front. It is not like carving a tombstone, like once the app is built, you never touch it again type of thing. Applications iterate very quickly, typically on a daily basis. So it's a very, very modern approach to building applications.</p><p>Now, the platform is relatively generic. It can build applications for any kind of service function throughout the enterprise, but we focus the application portfolio on the needs of internal IT, most notably IT service management, instant management, problem management, change management, configuration management. These are disciplines that are very well known, very precisely defined and understood in IT organizations.</p><p>But ServiceNow is used by the vast majority of our customers not just inside IT, but also outside of IT, and also in customer-facing applications. So that significantly increases the total addressable market. It is really a multiple of what we think the IT opportunity is for us.</p><p>We are very focused on large enterprises. The bigger your IT budgets are, the more IT people you have, the more value there is, typically, in deploying ServiceNow. We have about 1,900 customers as of the end of last quarter. About 360 of those are Global 2000 entities, so those are names anybody would recognize.</p><p>We are a SaaS Company, so we have a ratable revenue recognition model, very high predictability, very strong cash flow, so those are the good aspects of the model here.</p><p>Our customers are not really concentrated in any one vertical. We're in big tech, we're in big pharma, we're in big retail. We're public sector, state and local. General Electric is our largest customer, general industrial type stuff. They literally manage service providers, global outsourcers. Everywhere there is IT, you will find ServiceNow.</p><p>Now this is a new picture that we have inserted in our investor presentation, and it's really to create some perspective on what is the growth opportunity for ServiceNow over the long haul. Today, we are -- last 12 months' revenue, around $400 million, very similar to Workday. We have very similar scale, very similar growth pattern. Obviously, they are higher on the market cap side.</p><p>We really believe that on the strength of our pure IT ascent opportunity -- I will explain a little bit more about that -- that the Company has lines of sight in the next two years to get to the $1 billion revenue run rate.</p><p>But the question then becomes what happens after that. What is sort of your next major mile marker in terms of what you're aiming for in terms of growth and scale? Could we aspire to be a Salesforce class company in terms of revenues and so on, and what would that take? I will explain how we think, what our strategies are to get to that level, and then the question becomes, can you dream even bigger and aspire to get into the classes of the very, very large software companies in this space?</p><p>So this is important because one of the great things that so attracted me to ServiceNow 2.5 years ago is that this Company is really unbounded in terms of its addressable market opportunity, and it was very evident, because the Company has bled into all aspects of the enterprise, as well as beyond the enterprise in terms of customer facing, really without the Company even trying. And that is because of the advocacy role that IT departments play in the enterprise.</p><p>So this is probably one of the most important pictures I can show you. As many of you know, we have our DNA set, if you will, going all the way back to the mid-1990s. We didn't exist then as a company, but our founder, Fred Luddy, was the Chief Technology Officer of Peregrine Systems and Remedy software back in those days. And in 2004 when he started ServiceNow, he said I started ServiceNow really to atone for my sins, because he won't have to basically go after a lot of the systemic issues that has plagued that generation of software.</p><p>But help desk was the first service model that came into the enterprise to help IT organizations. In the mid-2000s, help desk really evolved into what we now call IT service management, and that was really under the influence of the IT infrastructure library framework, right? It was a precise set of definitions and it really superseded the notion of help desk as a service model.</p><p>It also drastically expanded the marketplace because in the days of help desk, you just licensed to people that were physically on the help desk, right? In the days of ITSM, everybody who was an owner of a part of the infrastructure, whether it was a server or a database or a virtual machine or a network, whatever it was, they were part of the workflow, and the same thing on the application side, right? Anybody who was an owner of an application or a piece of an application, they became part of it.</p><p>That's one of the things that was not understood at the time of our IPO is that ITSM was really an order of magnitude greater opportunity than the historical help desk of the mid-1990s.</p><p>We had to push the boundaries of ITSM even bigger to a notion that we refer to as ERP for IT. And ERP for IT, really everybody in the IT organization is really an actor and a participant in the workflow, and it becomes really the system of record for that function. And that's been a very strong driving part of our vision.</p><p>Now, what has happened in our business, and this is super important to appreciate what's going on at ServiceNow, is that IT organizations, and particularly the IT executives, CIOs and so on, they have taken the IT service model and recognized that it is actually very easy to adapt and repurpose for service domains beyond IT.</p><p>So you very typically see ServiceNow showing up in human resources. Human resources has historically not had a service model, right? They had email. If you had issues and you needed help from HR, what did you do? You sent them an email and hoped the hell that somebody would get back to you and it wouldn't go into a black hole.</p><p>The same thing with facilities. They don't have service models, either. You manage outsource, that stuff typically has been done through email as well. So this whole notion of having service models and service management systems is actually relatively new when you get outside of the parameters of the enterprise IT function.</p><p>So this is something that has been catching fire, because people very quickly start to recognize how easy it is to apply these service models to functions that have traditionally been dealt with on email, spreadsheets, personal databases, and so on. So I will talk about that more.</p><p>So ServiceNow, we refer to the platform as a service automation platform. I will explain to you what service relationships really are and what service automation really is. It is actually a devastatingly simple concept, but we recognize it differently.</p><p>So that service automation platform really established in the IT organization people that understand service models, very well defined, very mature. So that is where we land and that is why we use the advocacy of the IT organization.</p><p>What has happened is the service platform has really been pushing out in all these other functional areas. Just as we have needs of IT organization, we have needs of all these other organizations as well, but everybody can become either a requester or a provider of a service.</p><p>And I say a service, it can just be a request, literally, for a service or a product. It can just be information, can be help, can be a change, anything that anybody can possibly ask for.</p><p>Now, service relationship management, there are people that need something and there is people that can provide the services. The providers of the services are not necessarily people. Typically, they are systems or systems that are actually assisted by people. And a lot of the provisioning these days of service requests is done in a highly automated fashion -- no hands, speed of light, lights out.</p><p>But what is different when you do this in a system rather than on email is that we actually define what the service is. Now you go, what do you mean by definition? When I sent somebody an email, I am defining what I'm asking for. That is actually unstructured, right?</p><p>What you do in a service management system, you actually have a very precise data definition of what that service is. What that lets you do is aggregate the data and create reporting metrics -- dashboarding and analytics around it, and you can actually ask the question, what were the top three things that HR worked on in this particular location over this particular period of time? You can't do that when you have emails. So how do you actually manage relationships if you don't even know what people are working on?</p><p>Secondly, the provisioning of services actually happens through a defined workflow, as opposed to who you know running around the building type of thing and constantly following up with the status of my PO, blah, blah, blah, that sort of thing. So building these things into systems has been a very, very powerful thing for us.</p><p>And then, finally, automation. Automation is really the mantra of the cloud. The opportunity to disintermediate these processes is just enormous.</p><p>We have one of our large financial institution customers, they got 35,000 IT people on service. Now, they were telling us we're going to take in 2014 1,000 people on IT strictly through automation. IT organizations tend to be overstaffed, underautomated, and the opportunity to start inverting that equation is incredible. Taking 1,000 people out is dropping $100 million to the bottom line. You better believe that matters, and you look at IT staffs around the world, they are huge. So the opportunity to go after savings and efficiency there is phenomenal.</p><p>Now, what we're really after here with service relationship management is really to create a new class of software. 15 years ago, we really didn't know what ERP was, and we certainly didn't know what CRM was, either, right? ERP really grew out of a variety of applications, general ledger and accounts receivable and so on, and gradually that -- and spreadsheets, by the way, and then gradually, that really became a real suite of systems, really typically owned by the Chief Financial Officer really integrating all the back-office operations.</p><p>More recently, we have seen this similar phenomenon in the front office, notably Salesforce really driving the notion of a sales and marketing and the service cloud. Once front office -- and by the way, that is where the CMO is really the dominant owner of the systems.</p><p>So we view the CIO, Chief Information Officer, as really being the guy or the gal in the middle and that really manages the work and the service relationships that exist between these departments. And you are, like, well, I can't really see this opportunity. That's right because today it lives in Lotus Notes, it lives in SharePoint, it lives in tons of spreadsheets.</p><p>You go to large institutions. I know at UBS, the CIO told us one time, yes, we've got 5,000 systems, 4,975. Actually our spreadsheets are Microsoft Access personal databases. Every large institution has thousands and thousands and thousands of these small applications lying around that are service oriented, and it's a huge problem because a lot of them are on laptops. They are sitting in the back of cars. They are not secure, they are not compliant, they are not multi-user. They are just not enterprise grade, and they're old. The people that have built them have long gone. So there is really this incredible opportunity for an IT organization to establish common platform for this kind of activity and work.</p><p>So that's our ambition, to establish the category that way.</p><p>Now this is how everybody knows IT. We make a request of IT -- my printer is out of toner. Can you please help? But these days, most requests coming into IT are not coming from people anymore; they are coming from machines. Events are raised in the infrastructure; events programmatically become incidents. Incidents are effectively the initiation of a structured workflow. A lot of that is not people to people; it is literally system to system. Now we are a long ways away from the world of help desk here.</p><p>But I can change this relationship very easy. Sometimes we refer to this as the monkey in the middle. IT goes out of the middle; now HR becomes the service provider and everybody else the requester. HR can really run the exact same service model that IT does. Many of our customers actually take our applications and just repurpose them for HR, and when I say repurpose, they just rename them.</p><p>HR people don't like to talk about incidents; they call them cases. No big deal. It's exactly the same thing, but they have their own terminology and their own words and their own nomenclature, and it's so easy to do. The notion to sequence of incident, problem, and change, which is so typical for IT people, applies to any service domain. This is essentially a way of managing service.</p><p>General Electric does this for turbines. We have people that do it for x-ray machines; Intel does it for lab equipment. So any physical or even nonphysical asset can be the subject of these kinds of service models.</p><p>So we believe, and we [focelate] this a lot with our CIO audience, that the future of IT and particularly the CIO really is in the management of service in the enterprise. You think about it, IT is in a bit of a precarious spot because infrastructure is moving to the cloud, slowly but surely, fits and starts, and that has been the dominant preoccupation of IT is running infrastructure, keeping the lights on.</p><p>A lot of the apps are moving to the line of business. Certainly, Salesforce is running around saying CMOs have had more budget now than CIOs. That's true. What is IT going to do? What is going to be their mission and their goal in life?</p><p>So this whole notion of managing service, shared services, throughout the enterprise, we believe, is the opportunity for IT. We can work so much better through disintermediation. We can do so much more with less. We can really manage for service performance and we have an opportunity to really impact the service experience itself.</p><p>Standing in line for service is just very awful. We always take pictures around the world when we travel, what are the worst service experiences on the planet? DMV is probably near the top. US Postal Service, immigration, and we have so many -- there are so many instructive places where we can learn about a really superior service experience. You can go to Amazon, you can go to Expedia, online banking, and this is really what IT can do for the world is really bring a service experience that is consumerized, really world class, and is something where we want to go, as opposed to somewhere that we have to go.</p><p>Real quickly, one of our big inspirations for our strategy was actually the city of CERN. CERN is actually not a city; it is a nuclear research organization in Europe on the French/Swiss border, but there is 700 buildings and 30,000 scientists that travel through there, and they run the entire city of CERN on ServiceNow. They essentially defined a services taxonomy; I think there is 650 services.</p><p>This is all the stuff in every walk of life or any category of service that scientists can request, whether it is transportation, whether it is lodging, whether it is entertainment, whether it is food, help, facilities. You see all the things that a regular city has, CERN has as well.</p><p>That concept has really taken off because this is the notion of a service model. And a lot of our business partners are really pursuing different verticals, lines of business, developing standard service models that they can wholesale, deliver through their customers, as opposed to something that we are going to build from scratch every single time.</p><p>Why now? The technology is making it so much easier, faster, and cheaper. Outsourcing drives a lot of this, right, because you can't manage service relationships, outsourcing relationships, without systems. Regulated industries, they got to prove they are following a defined workflow, and of course, mobile. People are not in offices, but they are in hospitals, schools, or in the field. It dramatically opens up the opportunity for automation.</p><p>So with that, I would like to wrap this up, sit down, and see if we can answer some questions. This is our management group. As you said, Mike and I have worked together -- actually, most of our management team has been together for a very long time. It is kind of a unique story in the industry for people having worked together in two companies now for the better part of seven or eight years.</p><p>With that, I will put this away and I will sit down.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRENT THILL: Thanks, Frank. We will open it up to questions. If you have a question, please raise your hand. I have questions to get it going. So this is your conference, but just to maybe kick it off.</p><p>Just from -- the biggest question we get from investors is how you measure your TAM as you move beyond a broader service automation market. Is it easy enough to put a single number on it or is it too complex because it is this moving target every year? Salesforce talked about this yesterday. They raised their TAM by a pretty big order of magnitude, almost $18 billion within a year. So is this --</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: The interesting thing is people like Workday because they can see a very big TAM, in terms of the business that SAP and Oracle does. But it takes talent to hit a target that nobody else can hit, but it takes genius to hit a target that nobody else can see.</p><p>And a lot of what we do is transformational. It is not totally visible to the world. Do you really believe that people are going to really implement these service relationships systems versus keep running 20-year-old spreadsheets and email-type paradigm? Yes, it takes a little bit of a leap of faith.</p><p>But you come to our users conference and we have -- in May in Vegas, we had 4,000 people, even though we only had 1,500 customers at the time. We had 4,000 people show up. Next year, we are expecting 6,000 to 7,000 here in San Francisco. The place is just buzzing with all the opportunities that people are pursuing to implement the technology in ways you cannot even get your head around.</p><p>I travel almost every week and it is extraordinarily inspiring to see what people do with the platform. That is why my first words out of my mouth are we are a platform company. This is not about the apps. We can literally go anywhere with the apps. We just love the IT opportunity because that is a market you can see. We are replacing 10-, 15-year-old software.</p><p>And you can look at our rate of monetization. We have about 18% penetration, of which probably a third saturated in terms of opportunity.</p><p>You can see what our revenue run rate is. There is about 12,000 enterprises that we think are appropriate and applicable to our business, and you do the math on that, the IT opportunity alone is in the $8 billion to $10 billion of spend. You get outside of IT, you're dealing with a multiple of that size. I don't know how big that multiple is. Maybe it is a multiple of [1]. I can't authoritatively put that number on it because it is not a market that has metastasized to the point where you can really do that.</p><p>BRENT THILL: Let's bring Mike into this conversation. Your run rate, you are running the $0.5 billion run rate, and your growth rate, you effectively don't have too many people at that type of growth. Can you just help us understand how you're putting the right infrastructure in and sales processes in to help? As many companies have hit that milestone and hit a speed bump, you don't seem like you're at all feeling any resistance on your wings, if you will.</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI, CFO, SERVICENOW, INC.: I think we -- I joined the Company slightly after Frank, a little over almost 2.5 years ago, I guess, a little over two years ago, and one of the first things I did when I saw that growth is -- I think we hire the right people. We put in place the right systems. We still have a lot of improvement, especially on the sales automation side, but we are rolling that out right now and I feel pretty comfortable with what we are doing with preparing for that growth.</p><p>The biggest challenge we had with this Company that I never had before is how geographically dispersed we are as a Company and the burden that it puts on facilities. A lot of people don't realize when you're adding -- we will have added north of 700 people this year. We think next year we are probably going to add 700 to 800 people. The problem is is forecasting when those people are going to go and making sure that you don't overcommit yourself to a facility.</p><p>We made some mistakes early on on the facility side. We fixed that. You saw some of those charges we took early on in 2012, but we think we have the right people in place to scale the Company.</p><p>It is really the people. The systems are there, too. We run on SAP and we're using a lot of our own internal -- our own product for our own internal systems as well. We built a procurement system that we just went live with. There is a bunch of other systems that we are building as well.</p><p>We built out our own sales force on our own product method. We're going to sell that as an app, but it has all the functionality for us internally with the pipeline and the weighting and managing that as well. We manage all of our customers from a support perspective through our own product.</p><p>BRENT THILL: You had (multiple speakers)</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: (multiple speakers) infrastructure is run on our platform.</p><p>BRENT THILL: A few questions from investors around the pricing. You had, I think, a minor update to the pricing. Can you just crystallize what you did and why you did it?</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: When we joined the Company, there was one price and it bought you everything, and half the customers loved it, like this is great. You are not nickel and diming me. The other half hated it because they didn't want to pay for everything that they weren't using. So it was a no-win situation.</p><p>And as time wore on, we decided that we were going to morph the pricing model to much more of an a la carte thing. In other words, you could buy exactly what you wanted, pay for that, and you could expand your usage as you went along. If you were not using our platform to build custom bespoke apps, then don't pay for that. But if you do, then we will charge you for that.</p><p>We have basically entry-level bundles of software now that just lets you commit to the platform at a number that is more amenable for people that don't want to step up to the whole thing.</p><p>So that is really the change in pricing strategy for new customers. They don't know any better, so it is what it is. That is our model. When we do renewals, obviously we have to take people through the transition of the model, but that's just part of doing business.</p><p>We're also, obviously, trying to monetize our business more intelligently, but most important is reduce friction in the sales process.</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI: It also helps us be more scalable because you don't have reps coming for exception pricing all the time, because you have certain customers that only value a certain component of our offering, and now we can offer those as separate SKUs. And we feel we are not going to leave as much money on the table with those upsells in the future with those customers.</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: We have customers like Volkswagen, who has a massive service catalog application across the enterprise with 800,000 people on it. That is just what they wanted to do. They look at our product, I just want to buy that.</p><p>Our pricing model was not set up for that, so it takes a lot of negotiating and a lot of work. So we wanted to make that just easier and really build those kind of options into the model.</p><p>BRENT THILL: Mike, you gave very encouraging billing guidance for Q4, and maybe if you can work back and just help us understand what you're seeing in the customer behavior to get to such a strong number in terms of what you are seeing in contract size and duration. Any trends, high-level trends, that maybe highlight the strength of your business?</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI: Sure, contract length has been pretty consistent, new business. It runs 35 months on average. Remember, we incent our sales force to sell a three-year contract with 12 months' billings in advance, which, by the way, we are seeing less and less of those multiple-year payments in advance.</p><p>You'll notice last quarter was actually the lowest at only 4% of our billings were multiple years, and that's on purpose. We are not incentivizing the sales force because the customers we deal with, there is no credit issues with those.</p><p>Remember, a big chunk of our billings is not necessarily just the new business we sign in the quarter. A lot of it is our backlog, as we are building our backlog. There is professional services that go into that as well, too. And based upon what we are seeing with our backlog that I know is going to be billed this quarter, we feel very confident that the guidance I gave when I was asked the question was plus $150 million or north of $150 million.</p><p>BRENT THILL: 50% plus?</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI: I feel pretty good about that number.</p><p>BRENT THILL: Great.</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI: You got to remember, we added a lot of people in our sales and marketing organization the first half of this year. We are now starting to see a lot of those reps going to full productivity because it is a nine-month ramp, so Q4 we are seeing a lot of those reps and the benefit of those. We see it in the pipeline with the deals right now.</p><p>BRENT THILL: You had a great slide, which basically showed the leaders in the cloud, which you are one of them. Our simple thesis has been there is going to be a front office and a back office and the service and the traveling expense, and maybe an infrastructure, but there will be some big clouds that are going to take over. And I think just being in the city yesterday at Salesforce's event with 130,000-plus people, you see this whole industry almost hitting the tipping point now.</p><p>From your perspective, what do you think is left for this to really continue to hit, or have we hit this now and the old-school vendors just can't even catch this now because they are so poorly architected and their business models are built for the past?</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: Yes, I think the business model is probably the least of their issues. I think -- we call it Soviet-era software. It is so backward, it is almost unapproachable for today's generation of people that have to work with it.</p><p>We have customers that, initial instance, would not go with us and picked up a CA or a BMC or whatever, and then a year later, they are, like, are we stupid that we can't do this? It is not that they are stupid; it's just generationally there is so much separation between the people that have to do it and the technology, from what era it comes from. And it is not just that it is not that good, it's that people simply are just wholesale failing with it.</p><p>So having a modern architecture, a modern platform, and the changes are just phenomenal what is possible today versus before. I don't think there's enough appreciation out there. People really do not fully understand what these differences are.</p><p>The consumer approach by Amazon, Google, Expedia, and so on has really given the enterprise sector to become much better than they have ever been. Our Company was founded -- Fred Luddy was inspired by Yahoo and Google. He was like that is what enterprise software should be like. Salesforce is a generation before that, but also made huge headway on that front.</p><p>This are very important things because it makes the platform more approachable. More people can get productive on the platform. We're a nonprogrammer platform. There is no procedural language. That expands your population by orders of magnitude. Anybody who has an Excel spreadsheet, and I am sure everybody in this room touches Excel, you can build apps on our platform. That is a statement you could ever make in prior generation.</p><p>BRENT THILL: The question on competition comes up, and clearly Salesforce is not going to walk away without giving up the fight on the service angle. And they talked about Philips embedding a service button right in the MRI machine yesterday, where they could just hit and the technician could get help driven right from the machine. When you think about where they're going and where you are at, you mentioned GE. Both are customers of respective companies. It seems like there is room for both of you right now, given your focus and given how big this market is.</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: Yes, we think there is. And the reason is we're not presumptuous enough to say we do everything for everybody. We are all things to all people.</p><p>We build a certain class of applications really, really well. That is why we have a high level of abstraction. We are not a generic programming platform the way Salesforce is. That said, we do come head to head. You mentioned GE. We had a confrontation there with GE Energy, which we won. All the warranty claims processing of power turbines and things like that all runs on ServiceNow.</p><p>But what our customers will tell you is that the application is appropriate for ServiceNow. We are an order of magnitude cheaper and faster than Salesforce in terms of the implementation.</p><p>But I gave you a caveat. In other words, not every app is appropriate for us. We look for these workflow request/response type of applications.</p><p>But Salesforce is much more generic. It is aiming at a lower level of developer. They may not be aiming for it, but it requires a lower level of developer than what ServiceNow does. The guy from GE Energy said to us at the conference, he said it took us longer to decide than actually build and roll out a fully deployed system. That's how inverted things are these days. People spend more time talking that actually delivering stuff.</p><p>BRENT THILL: I will ask you one more and then we can open it up. Just from a sales force capacity, it seems like you have the right platform now. Now you are probably bound more by distribution capacity than anything. Can you give us a sense of how that buildout has been going this year, how you think about the next year?</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI: We were actually working on it yesterday, our 2014 headcount plan for sales.</p><p>So we entered the year with 350 people in our sales and marketing organization. Our plan was to exit with 600. We very much front-end loaded that. We're going to do somewhere around 610 we are going to exit, so slightly ahead of plan.</p><p>Next year, we anticipate that we are going to hire a similar amount, 250, 270 people into the sales and marketing organization. There is going to be a focus on a lot of developing markets. We really moving into Asia-Pacific. We're going to go heavier in Latin America, South America as well. And we are really focused on where are the Global 2000.</p><p>We are seeing that kind of nine-month ramp time for developed territories for reps. These new geographies we're going into, like Japan was one that we went into, that is a 15-month, plus, ramp cycle. On average, we think it is about 15 months to ramp in new territories.</p><p>You don't want to add too fast, though, especially in your existing territories, because you disincent your existing salespeople. You got to give them plenty of notice when you're going to split territories to close deals. If not, you will lose people. Remember, your best source of finding people is through your existing people, and you want them to be happy. And happy for a salesperson is knowing they can make a good W-2.</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: Sales cycles are longer, actually. You cannot just sort of willy-nilly yank territories around because they're working all these transactions for many, many months.</p><p>MIKE SCARPELLI: This is an ERP-type sale. It does not happen overnight. It doesn't mean that it takes them that nine months to make the decision, but our customers do not pull the trigger until they're ready to do the implementation, because as soon as they sign the contract, the subscription starts, and they want to make sure that they plan their own internal resources to do the deployment.</p><p>BRENT THILL: Great. Do we have any questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Recently, there was a Piper survey that says that the top cloud winners, and you guys are obviously in the top five, which surprised me, just given your size, along with names like Amazon, Google, salesforce.com, then ServiceNow.</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: Why did that surprise you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It surprised me given your size, and Workday and other names are not on the top five. So I'm wondering if you have made a concerted effort to get a mind share of CIOs. These are CIOs who get -- who did the survey. So the question was (multiple speakers) you do that?</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: You are exactly right. We do make a concerted effort to address the executive audience. Because I said this during the prepared remarks, we're really trying to give IT organizations a forward strategy because they are in transition.</p><p>Things are going to change. IT is not staying where it had been with a screwdriver out and they are having the wiring closet and keeping the lights on and running around with their hair on fire. That model is going away.</p><p>IT is going to split between infrastructure and apps, and the infrastructure is moving to the cloud, whether we like it or not. It may be slowly in some places, but it is going to. So IT people need to develop a different approach of what they are in the enterprise. A lot of apps are going to be in other places, so they are embracing ServiceNow.</p><p>I saw a CIO the other day in New York at a large insurance company, and he said, look, ServiceNow is my service hub. That is the term that he used, not our term. He says it's the hub; it's the fabric; it's where all service relationships get implemented and managed. So therefore, we have high mind share with these people because we are central to their mission, much more so than other players.</p><p>The contrast between us and Salesforce is Salesforce is trying to get into the enterprise from the outside in. They are going after sales. They are going after marketing. They're going after customer support.</p><p>We come from the inside out through IT. So IT is our advocacy. It is our landing ground, and then from there through IT and with the advocacy of IT. Salesforce is always surprised when they see us, because where did you people come from, because you didn't get there the way we did. So it's a completely inverted go-to-market model that we have, compared to them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I like to think you like to keep your sales people happy. Just a question in terms of you talked about the other opportunities, so you referenced HR, but then at the user conference, you also say that there are other things that you are discussing. Can you talk about where else within an organization you are actually starting to see interest in deploying ServiceNow, please? Thank you.</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: Yes, so the -- I call them service adjacencies. In other words, organizations that are highly analogous to IT is typically low-hanging fruit.</p><p>People can have a very clear line of sight. Okay, we're going to do HR because the service model is the same; facilities, the same thing. At UBS, your travel requests are running on ServiceNow. That is how you get permission to travel here from London, presumably, stuff like that. Or even legal organizations do it that way.</p><p>But you mentioned the Philips app with Salesforce. We have a customer in Belgium, [acva], who builds x-ray machines for hospitals, and they -- actually, they are in the middle of going live with this system right now. And they have deployed ServiceNow exactly the same way. So in other words, doctors and nurses in hospitals interact with the manufacturer through ServiceNow.</p><p>So we are in that same category of customer-facing applications. We have a very large retailer who uses us for balancing supply chains, because this store doesn't have enough of this and that store has too much of this. This constant process of rebalancing inventories between stores and distribution centers, they do on ServiceNow.</p><p>So these are examples that are farther afield from the typical service domain that we all know about through our normal work lives. But it is mind blowing because it is an infinite set of things. Everything that is request/response/workflow oriented is fair game for our platform. And you don't need programmers to stand up these apps, and apps are stood up in hours and days, not in weeks and months. So there is an order of magnitude speed difference in how quickly you can show something.</p><p>It is a very different mentality toward standing up applications, sort of what spreadsheets did to the world. All of a sudden, it just exploded application development. Why? Because everybody can use it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: What are the (inaudible) challenges to adoption? Do IT departments often feel threatened by you? And you said a lot of them are overstaffed. Do they worry that more efficient means they're going to have to be cutting their colleagues? Or when people don't take you, what is the reason, typically?</p><p>FRANK SLOOTMAN: The automation is a mixed blessing because the executives love it, but the workforce gets a little uneasy on that value proposition.</p><p>But the friction in our model is really that these are systems that are replacing systems that have been around for a long time, 10, 15 times, often times very heavily customized, very heavily integrated. People don't really know how they work. They are afraid to turn them off; they don't know how to turn them off. They don't know how to sequence themselves through that process.</p><p>Like Mike said, it is like an ERP deployment. It is very high profile. When these systems are not working, everybody knows about it. So this really has to be a very highly prioritized project. It is not something you push out and go, like, put me down for one of those and we will turn it on on Monday. Not like that. This is a very serious deployment.</p><p>The systems are very sticky because as lousy as these legacy systems are, they are not that easy to pull out. That is the friction that we deal with. That is why we have a sales force; otherwise, we'd just have a fax machine.</p><p>BRENT THILL: Great. Frank, Mike, thanks for your time.

Now they are a favourite target of politicians everywhere. Europe's finance ministers are discussing ways to increase taxes on digital services. Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, this week demanded that social-media platforms be able to take down terrorist material within two hours. In America Facebook's bosses must soon tell Congress what role users tied to Russia played in last year's presidential campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of this is still political theatre. But not all. America's Senate is contemplating the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), a bipartisan bill that seeks to deter sex trafficking by ensuring that the Communications Decency Act (CDA) does not protect online services, such as Backpage.com, notorious for making money with sex-trafficking ads (see page 66). Should the bill pass, a wave of lawsuits against social-media platforms is likely to follow.</p><p> SESTA highlights a growing problem with which many governments are grappling: how online firms should be held liable for illegal content that is published on their platforms. From October, Germany will require firms to take down hate speech and fake news within 24 hours, or face fines of up to ?50m ($60m). Yet the debate over SESTA is especially important. It could end up being the model for other areas, chilling free speech and innovation. </p><p>If the internet and some of the firms it has spawned have taken over the world, this is the result not simply of entrepreneurial brilliance but also of an implicit subsidy. In America and Europe online platforms have until now inhabited a parallel legal universe. Broadly speaking, relevant media laws\u2014in particular the CDA\u2014exempt them from liability for what their users do or for the harm that their services can cause.</p><p>This made sense in the early days of the internet, when it was still a sideshow. Ruinous lawsuits might have crushed then-infant digital ventures. But today online firms have come to dominate entire industries. They can also no longer be considered neutral conduits for information, like telecoms carriers. Facebook's algorithms, for instance, determine what members see in their news feeds. The words and deeds of online ghouls have consequences in the real world.</p><p>SESTA has a worthy aim. Yet it is too broad. It greatly expands the definition of enabling sex trafficking, including ten actions, from advertising to transporting. It would also let state attorneys-general and civil claimants sue online platforms. A deluge of lawsuits is likely. In general, big tech firms can afford such programmes, but startups may face bankruptcy. Both will want to avoid trouble by erring on the side of safety, curbing free speech.</p><p>Rather than attempt to define precisely what material is banned\u2014which invites arguments\u2014the law should instead require firms only to follow a reasonable, transparent process by which they decide what to take down. That would cover sites like Backpage.com and limit potential lawsuits. It should take into account differences in size. Smaller firms could be held to a different standard, depending on their resources and business models. Widely accessible sites could be more tightly regulated than those with a restricted audience.</p><p>The drawback is that this turns online firms, especially big ones, into arbiters of acceptable speech. But it would be preferable to a series of all-controlling, SESTA-like laws, which could ultimately turn them into regulated utilities (see Schumpeter). To avoid that fate, they need to realise that, as the dominant actors of the digital age, they bear special responsibility. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-GC6OG7F</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ4-JHH1-DY2R-21Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The deal, if approved, would create a media giant that combines AT&amp;T's mobile and satellite distribution networks with Time Warner's huge collection of popular movies and television offerings, including \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, news on CNN and college and professional basketball on TNT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them? How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasingly turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&amp;T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon.</p><p>But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers. The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers \u2014 in the media industry and beyond \u2014 will be permitted in the years to come.</p><p>\"This court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,\" said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. \"This case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.\"</p><p>The Justice Department's move to block the deal in November took Wall Street and the entertainment industry by surprise. Many executives and lawyers thought President Donald Trump's administration would usher in a hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, despite Trump's criticism of the deal on the campaign trail.</p><p>Instead, the Justice Department, under its antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, moved aggressively, demanding the sale of major parts of the businesses before a deal could go through. AT&amp;T responded by suggesting that Delrahim's decision was politically motivated and not based on established antitrust law. In recent weeks, though, the judge overseeing the case, Richard Leon of US District Court of the District of Columbia, has rejected moves by AT&amp;T to inject politics into the arguments.</p><p>Unless the two sides settle \u2014 and there have been no signs of that happening \u2014 the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the US's video future.</p><p>Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&amp;T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand \u2014 and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry. The Justice Department argues that the merged company's combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry.</p><p>It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls \"must-watch\" programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.</p><p>The government's case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&amp;T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming \u2014 the same combination that AT&amp;T is seeking \u2014 would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows.</p><p>That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses. Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast's merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast's holdings.</p><p>\"Either important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,\" the Justice Department said in pretrial filings. \"Or it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.\"</p><p>AT&amp;T scoffs at the government's predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government's theory that it would withhold content, AT&amp;T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.</p><p>Leading AT&amp;T's defence is Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles-based lawyer with a long track record in high-profile cases but not someone who is considered an antitrust expert. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&amp;T says Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems.</p><p>Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos. AT&amp;T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&amp;T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.</p><p>\"The new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,\" AT&amp;T said in its pretrial brief.</p><p>The merger is opposed by several lawmakers and many consumer groups. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don't own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say. Streaming competition is the \"best hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,\" said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.</p><p>--</p><p>Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government's intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies. \"The government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,\" said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham &amp; Co. AT&amp;T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Leon rejected those demands, and AT&amp;T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference \u2014 which it described as \"selective enforcement\" \u2014 from the case. But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration. The decision to block a merger between companies that don't directly compete is rare. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in such deals \u2014 getting companies to promise they'll be on their best behaviour \u2014 is not effective. That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS's $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna \u2014 as well as proposed media deals like Disney's acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting's purchase of Tribune Media.

The particular bill the Democratic leader is asking to move by unanimous consent is so partisan that it received one--just one--Republican vote over in the House.

Big Tech executives have faced an onslaught of criticism from US politicians at a high-stakes antitrust hearing which could lay the groundwork for tougher regulation of the major internet platforms.   Chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google were grilled for more than five hours in the unprecedented joint appearance - by video - before a House of Representatives panel investigating market dominance.   While the hearing was called to focus on whether the companies abuse their dominant positions in the market, it veered quickly into topics including political bias, privacy, dealings with China and how platforms deal with misinformation.   \"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.   Mr Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power - some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\"   As a great American, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, once said, \u201cWe must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d #BigTechHearing  pic.twitter.com/1xaGcfwiP1  \u2014 Cicilline Press Office (@RepCicilline) July 30, 2020  Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms.   \"The antitrust storm clouds appear to be building in the Beltway against Big Tech,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors.   \"With today's hearings setting the stage for a battle royale over the next 6 to 9 months.\"  Pandemic strength  Mr Cicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the clout of the four, saying: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"   Some lawmakers sought to play down the competitive danger of the companies, which have won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during virus lockdowns.   \"Being big is not inherently bad,\" said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. \"Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success.\"  Abusing platforms?   Politicians also put spotlights on problems with tech companies operating platforms relied upon by rivals.   Mr Pichai was pressed regarding whether Google's ad platform tactics hurt other internet players such as news outlets.   Apple's Tim Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company's App Store and its treatment of developers.   \"We treat all app developers the same,\" Mr Cook said. \"We do not retaliate or bully people.\"   Mr Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Mr Cicilline.   \"We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town,\" the committee chair said to the company founder.   Mr Bezos disputed the characterisation, while adding: \"There are a lot of options for small firms ... I think we are the best one.\"  Playing politics  President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing.   \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Mr Trump said.    Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase - Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\"   Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Mr Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.   \"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Mr Raskin said. \"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans.  Moving forward  Some analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being big.   \"There was considerable scepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,\" said Darrell West, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.   \"If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,\" Mr West said.   Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that while \"the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework\" he didn't think the hearing would lead to quick action.   Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said the hearing failed to demonstrate specific anti-competitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.

However, on Thursday, Biden delivered his most acute and powerful speech of the campaign, the kind of speech that many, even in his own party, doubted he could give.<br/>At times, Biden was optimistic about America's potential and sober about the upcoming problems, challenging the cartoon of hesitant speaker invented by the Trump campaign and benefiting from the low level at which his opponents had placed him.<br/>Joe Biden (Reuters) (KEVIN LAMARQUE/)<br/>It was proof that in the really important moments (whether to secure the support of rivals before the super-bestseller or by accepting the nomination) Biden is able to perform under pressure. But that's a skill that will be tested over and over again in the final stretch of the campaign.<br/>Harris broke down barriers and Biden's campaign hopes he can make his way among voters.<br/>Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general, made history on August 19 when she accepted the vice presidential nomination, to become the first black woman and the first Indian descendant to be named to the national formula of a major party. His outstanding presence throughout the convention and the fact that he talked about his own history in deeply personal terms emphasized the generational and racial diversity he brings to the candidacy, two factors in his ability so far to inject energy into Democrats as Biden's formula companion.<br/>The campaign team hopes that her vibrant speaking style and personal and political background will help her connect especially with Latino and African-American voters and deepen Biden's appeal among moderate white voters living in the suburbs. However, like Biden, Harris comes from the party's ruling class wing, and it is unclear that it will help Biden win over the more liberal activists who have long been skeptical of his candidacy.<br/>Kamala Harris (Reuters) (KEVIN LAMARQUE/)<br/>Obama's impassioned speech revealed it as the moral conscience of the party.<br/>Former President Barack Obama, generally known for his relaxed and balanced conduct, launched an unusually passionate and caustic attack on his successor at the White House, describing what was at stake in the election in harsh and chilling terms. This contestObama, Obama clarified, is not the typical partisan war, but the continuation of American democracy as we know it, he argued, and issued what many Democrats considered an emotional call to action.<br/>\"Don't let them take away their power. Don't let them take away their democracy,\" he urged.<br/>Michelle Obama, the former first lady, added her own lacerating attack and said Trump was \"the wrong president for our country\" and urged Americans to make plans to vote.<br/>The speeches were clear synthesis of the Democratic argument that this campaign is a national emergency, and Obama, Biden's most important validator, presented his vice president as a stable and decent leader for difficult times.<br/>Biden won the nomination and, for now, the message battle in his party.<br/>Since the start of Biden's 2020 campaign, his message has been simple: America's deepest problems cannot begin to be solved until Trump and Biden are defeated (due to his experience, character, and conciliatory instincts) he is the right person to defeat him. It was a speech that was based more on political calculation than on far-reaching political ambitions or a radically new vision of the nation, and many Democrats wondered whether that argument would be inspiring enough.<br/>But by this week, it was clear that even Biden's ideological opponents within the party (including Senator Bernie Sanders, the personification of the progressive movement) had accepted Biden's cause to focus on building the largest possible coalition to defeat Trump, and set aside political differences. In a speech that pleased a broad representative sample of the Democratic Party, Sanders posed the election as a battle against authoritarianism and promised that he would \"work with progressives, moderates, and, yes, conservatives to preserve this nation,\" in line with Biden's approach that the election was a unique crisis.<br/>Jill Biden helped the campaign emphasize an urgent issue for many Americans: education.<br/>Despite having served as second lady for eight years when Biden was vice president, Jill Biden was not especially well known on the national scene. This week Jill Biden, an English teacher by profession, now introduced herself as an educator who is intimately acquainted with the grave fears that many American parents are experiencing right now.<br/>Jill Biden (Reuters) (POOL/)<br/>In the message from a classroom where she once taught, she called directly to families concerned about their children's future at a time of uncertainty about what the school year will look like. She tried to link these concerns to her husband's priorities and indicated that the campaign understood that the full recovery from pandemic problems cannot happen until the needs of working parents were met.<br/>Democrats left their political differences behind, at least for now.<br/>Democrats have very divergent views on public policy and the political questions facing the party, including how to expand health insurance coverage, how to regulate Wall Street and big tech companies, and how much to value bipartisanship. But this week there was little political debate beyond a broad consensus on issues such as the fight against climate change and gun violence,reception of immigrants and improved access to health care.

However, on Thursday, Biden delivered his most acute and powerful speech of the campaign, the kind of speech that many, even in his own party, doubted he could give.<br/>At times, Biden was optimistic about America's potential and sober about the upcoming problems, challenging the cartoon of hesitant speaker invented by the Trump campaign and benefiting from the low level at which his opponents had placed him.<br/>It was proof that in the really important moments (whether to secure the support of rivals before the super-bestseller or by accepting the nomination) Biden is able to perform under pressure. But that's a skill that will be tested over and over again in the final stretch of the campaign.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Harris broke down barriers and Biden's campaign hopes he can make his way among voters.</emphasis><br/>Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general, made history on August 19 when she accepted the vice presidential nomination, to become the first black woman and the first Indian descendant to be named to the national formula of a major party. His outstanding presence throughout the convention and the fact that he talked about his own history in deeply personal terms emphasized the generational and racial diversity he brings to the candidacy, two factors in his ability so far to inject energy into Democrats as Biden's formula companion.<br/>The campaign team hopes that her vibrant speaking style and personal and political background will help her connect especially with Latino and African-American voters and deepen Biden's appeal among moderate white voters living in the suburbs. However, like Biden, Harris comes from the party's ruling class wing, and it is unclear that it will help Biden win over the more liberal activists who have long been skeptical of his candidacy.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Obama's impassioned speech </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">revealed it as the moral conscience of the party.</emphasis><br/>Former President Barack Obama, generally known for his relaxed and balanced conduct, launched an unusually passionate and caustic attack on his successor at the White House, describing what was at stake in the election in harsh and chilling terms. This presidential contest, Obama clarified, is not typicalpartisan war, but the continuation of American democracy as we know it, argued, and issued what many Democrats considered an emotional call to action.<br/>\"Don't let them take away their power. Don't let them take away their democracy,\" he urged.<br/>Michelle Obama, the former first lady, added her own lacerating attack and said Trump was \"the wrong president for our country\" and urged Americans to make plans to vote.<br/>The speeches were clear synthesis of the Democratic argument that this campaign is a national emergency, and Obama, Biden's most important validator, presented his vice president as a stable and decent leader for difficult times.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biden won the nomination and, for now, the message battle in his party.</emphasis><br/>Since the start of Biden's 2020 campaign, his message has been simple: America's deepest problems cannot begin to be solved until Trump and Biden are defeated (due to his experience, character, and conciliatory instincts) he is the right person to defeat him. It was a speech that was based more on political calculation than on far-reaching political ambitions or a radically new vision of the nation, and many Democrats wondered whether that argument would be inspiring enough.<br/>But by this week, it was clear that even Biden's ideological opponents within the party (including Senator Bernie Sanders, the personification of the progressive movement) had accepted Biden's cause to focus on building the largest possible coalition to defeat Trump, and set aside political differences. In a speech that pleased a broad representative sample of the Democratic Party, Sanders posed the election as a battle against authoritarianism and promised that he would \"work with progressives, moderates, and, yes, conservatives to preserve this nation,\" in line with Biden's approach that the election was a unique crisis.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jill Biden helped the campaign emphasize an urgent issue for many Americans: education.</emphasis><br/>Despite having served as second lady for eight years when Biden was vice president, Jill Biden was not especially well known on the national scene. This week Jill Biden, an English teacher by profession, now introduced herself as an educator who is intimately acquainted with the grave fears that many American parents are experiencing right now.<br/>In the message from a classroom where she once taught, she called directly to families concerned about their children's future at a time of uncertainty about what the school year will look like. She tried to link these concerns to her husband's priorities and indicated that the campaign understood that the full recovery from pandemic problems cannot happen until the needs of working parents were met.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democrats left their political differences behind, at least for now.</emphasis><br/>Democrats have very divergent views on public policy and the political questions facing the party, including how to expand health insurance coverage, how to regulate Wall Street and big tech companies, and how much to value bipartisanship. But this week there was little political debate beyond a broad consensus of issues such ascombating climate change and gun violence, receiving immigrants and improving access to health care. Overall, the amount of praise for Biden's character far exceeded any minuance on his government agenda.<br/>Democrats seem united in their strategy to defeat Trump, but how long will that last? And while that was the message party leaders wanted to give at the convention, will it be adopted by liberal activists on party bases who have always been uninthhusiastic about Biden?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democrats sho turned the hand out of the independents and the Republicans. Were those voters listening to them?</emphasis><br/>Although Democrats spent the week mobilizing to unify the party around Biden and Harris, it was clear that the convention prioritized rapprochement with moderate voters who do not identify as Democrats, but who are disillusioned with Trump's handling of the Republican Party.<br/>From videos with Republican figures like former Ohio Governor John Kasich to Biden's insistence that the election was \"not a partisan moment\" but an \"American moment,\" Democrats pushed the message that the country was above the party all along.<br/>The critical test for Biden after the convention will be: how many undecided voters listened to and got excited about that message?<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CELAME-107089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CELAME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NT-MRJ1-DY1R-B3WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 ContentEngineLLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Latin America Migration English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Mundo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>The New York Times</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Convenci\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>elecciones Estados Unidos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>En Segundos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kamala Harris</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Revenue from ad-supported videos are split 55-45 per cent in the publisher's favour. Seven Studios chief executive Therese Hegarty confirmed some video content created would be ad-supported.</p><p>Big tech companies have come under increased regulatory scrutiny for undermining the business model of traditional media by grabbing advertising revenue without spending on the content that supports it.</p><p>Other deals are expected to follow. \"We are keen to support the Australian ecosystem,\" a Facebook spokeswoman said.</p><p>Ms Hegarty said the new content would be published daily and act as an extension of some of the network's biggest brands.</p><p>\"It will provide deeper engagement for the audiences \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 who are interested in behind the scenes or a different take on some of the content,\" she said. \"There'll be some exclusive content and some non-exclusive content.\" The content arrangement will run for 12 months, with an option to extend. While Seven's major television brands will be the initial focus, Seven Studios hopes to build content from other programs. Seven declined to say how much it was spending to create content. Facebook and media com-panies await a final report due on June 30 from the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer -Commission on the impact of digital platforms on traditional media.A Seven West Media spokesman said the deal didn't change the fact digital platforms needed stronger regulation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-96e954bc8a6211e9a5072410a1462709ac6bff7675bbef42ea2bb616976d5236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9D-1CY1-F0JP-W1C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 10, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When asked to explain why, six in ten said (59%) it was an invasion of privacy.</p><p>More than half (53%) are concerned people could be unfairly influenced with political advertising without their knowledge. Nearly half (48%) also felt that advertisers would target people when they are at their most vulnerable.</p><p>Tanya O\u2019Carroll, Director of Amnesty Tech, said:</p><p>\u201cThe poll results are stark and consistent - a clear majority of people are worried about the power Big Tech has over their lives.

Our poll shows that people simply don\u2019t trust Big Tech to determine the terms of political debate.\u201d</p><p>The poll, conducted by YouGov, asked nearly 10,000 people for their opinions on online privacy across nine countries: Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Norway, South Africa and the US.</p><p>Almost half of those polled (49%) are more cautious about how they share their personal information online. Over a third (37%) avoid certain search terms or web pages because they are concerned about tracking, while the same percentage of people (37%) elected not to use a platform because of data privacy concerns. This shows that online corporate surveillance is having a chilling on people\u2019s ability to access the digital world. Nearly a third (32%) use tools to limit online tracking.</p><p>Tech threat to human rights</p><p>The results of the poll reinforce Amnesty\u2019s analysis that the core business-model of Facebook and Google poses a systemic threat to human rights.

Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Federica Whitfield. All right. Just a short time ago, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo renewed his calls for the Federal government to provide more testing in the battle against the coronavirus. The governor saying his state is not at the stage where it can begin to reopen the economy. He also says widespread testing is the number one factor needed to get people back to work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Testing. Testing is the single most important topic for us to understand I think, and it's important that we understand it. The more you test, the more information, the more you can reopen society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: But some states are beginning to loosen their restrictions. Right now in Jacksonville, Florida people are flocking to the beaches. And in Texas, a planning of a rolling reopening of businesses is taking places early as next week. President Trump now says governors will have the authority to reopen once they meet certain criteria. Syria, but a new model used by the White House shows only four states may be ready to reopen by May 4th.</p><p>We're talking about Vermont, West Virginia, Montana and Hawaii, while dozens of others may have to wait until June, perhaps even July. Meanwhile, medical experts including a former director for the Centers for Disease Control where the U.S. is still lagging way behind in testing to safely reopen the country. CNN's team of correspondents are on the scene in cities across the country right now.</p><p>Let's start in New York where today Governor Andrew Cuomo discussed what it will take before his state can reopen. CNN's Cristina Alesci joining me now so. Cristina, the governor, you know, spoke a lot about testing, but also about Federal funding that partnership. CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Those are the two things that he said are necessary in order to get the economy back up and running. What he described in that press conference was a fairly tenuous situation. Yes, there are some glimmers of hope in the sense that hospitalization rates are going down. But the death count is still very high.</p><p>And the way that he described the healthcare situation here really stuck out, he said, it's barely stabilizing. That's because here in New York, we still have 2000 people walking into the state's hospitals across the state every day with COVID. And he says, look, this is a tenuous situation. So the two things that are necessary is testing and funding. And it's clear on the testing front that he is making it his personal mission to inform the public as to why testing is important because we keep hearing testing, testing, testing.</p><p>Well, one of the things that testing informs is the infection rate. How many people does one person in fact and right now that number is below one in New York, and that's where the governor wants to keep it in order to reopen the economy and you can only get that kind of information with massive testing. And he said, Look, New York has been leading the charge on testing and we're still not doing enough on the funding front.</p><p>Not only is money from the Federal government necessary to support that kind --that -- in that level of testing. But if you want to have a successful reopening of the economy, you have to have certain basic government services functions, like the train systems and the school systems up and running, fully functional so that people could get back to work and that the economy can, you know, reemerge essentially.</p><p>And if you look at it, some people at home may be wondering, look, Congress just passed $2 trillion in stimulus. Clearly some of that money went to the States. Yes, it did. But a very small amount of that whole entire two trillion went to the states. A lot of it went to unemployment benefits, local -- the small business lending, airline rescue, so what he and other governors are calling for is $500 billion to be spread across all of these states in order to ensure an economic recovery that will be, you know, done in a way that's both safe and effective. Fred?</p><p>[13:05:12]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Cristina Alesci , thank you so much. All right. Meanwhile, the White House is focusing on the reopening of the economy despite warnings from medical experts to not rush the process. CNN Kristen Holmes joining us now. So Kristen, the White House, you know, being pressed about the number of tests available, which governors including the New York governor, you know, says is really key to reopening the economy and that there isn't enough testing.</p><p>KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Fred. And we're hearing from governors on both sides of the aisle who say that testing is key. And they're very skeptical of this idea which Vice President Pence said yesterday that there are enough tests to reopen the economy or at least to meet phase one in certain places. And the reason for their skepticism is that they've heard this from the administration now for more than a month.</p><p>And it was early March when we heard President Trump saying that there was a test for everyone. Every single person who wanted to be tested could be tested. And of course, we know it wasn't true then and it's still not true. Now, I talked to state officials, both sides of the aisle to kind of get an idea of what exactly was missing in this testing. Where's the disconnect between the state and the Federal government?</p><p>And here's what I learned. One of the things is about the length of time it takes to turn around these tests. So essentially, the administration has pointed states to their own state labs and private labs and said these labs aren't at capacity. Why are you testing more people? Well, one person that I spoke to one state official said, the reason being that a lot of these labs have a four to five-day turnaround.</p><p>That is too long if you're trying to reopen the economy. You can't put people back in the workforce and then take them out again for five days while they wait for the results and then get to contact tracing eventually. The other side of this, of course, being the supplies, those reagents, those swabs. Now President Trump said yesterday that they were going to send 5.5 million swabs -- excuse me, billion swabs out to the states there to get people to supplies they need.</p><p>But we heard from Governor Cuomo, he said his problem was those reagents and those chemicals and we didn't hear enough about what they're doing to fix that, on that in there. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: And now, Kristen, tell us more about what we're hearing, furloughed employees working at many of Trump's prop properties.</p><p>HOLMES: Well, that's right. So, 713 people have been furloughed from two of President Trump's properties in Florida talking about Doral and Mar-a-Lago. Now we know from the numbers here, we have 560 employees that were furloughed from Trump National Doral Miami and then another 153 employees from Mar-a-Lago and when it comes to Mar-a-Lago we know that they had suspended their services just about a month ago.</p><p>But this really goes to show you that it's not just this idea of mom and pop shops that are shutting down and small businesses, you're seeing this problem across the board. I mean, they work for the Trump family. And again, they're having to furlough workers. This is taking a huge economic toll on our country.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Kristen Holmes at the White House. Thanks so much. So even as social distancing guidelines remain in place, Vice President Mike Pence visiting the Air Force Academy right now. You see him arriving there in Colorado Springs. Today he'll be delivering the commencement address for the graduation ceremony. CNN Sarah Westwood is following all of this. So Sarah, what kind, you know, of protections or guidelines are being honored by the vice president who is heading the task force?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes. That's right, Fred. And this is actually the first time that we're seeing the President or the Vice President venture outside of Washington in weeks. They have been grounded for a long time in accordance with these recommendations from Federal health officials that Americans just should not be traveling for any reason and they should not be gathered in groups larger than 10.</p><p>Now obviously, this being the Air Force Academy's commencement ceremony, there are going to be more than 10 people at this event, but the Air Force Academy tells us that they are taking a lot of precautions to keep the Vice President, other guests and especially the cadets healthy today, they're going to be marching six feet apart. For example, they're going to be sitting eight feet apart during the ceremony, as are the people who are going to be on stage alongside the Vice President.</p><p>Now President Trump said yesterday he thinks it's great that the VP is going up to this commencement ceremony and Trump actually announced that he himself will be delivering the commencement address at West Point next month. And this is coming as the White House is pushing this message in this sort of time for states for governors to start preparing to open their seats as soon as possible as close that May 1st target date is possible.</p><p>So, showing that this is what they want for life to be able to return to normal, for people to be able to start traveling, events to start being held again. So, the Vice President, a milestone here of sorts of him venturing out for the first time in weeks to a state other than Washington, D.C., Fred.</p><p>[13:10:02]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Sarah Westwood. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. All right. The coronavirus outbreak. Aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt continues to worsen. The U.S. Navy said today that four additional crew members have tested positive which brings the total number of infected to 669. As of now, 94 percent of the crew has been tested. I want to bring in CNN Pentagon Reporter Ryan Browne in Washington.</p><p>So, Ryan, what more can you tell us about the conditions of those who have bitten -- who have tested positive?</p><p>RYAN BROWNE, CNN PENTAGON REPORTER: Well, Fred most of the sailors who have tested positive are asymptomatic. They're not showing any symptoms. They have tested positive for coronavirus but they've been put into isolation and quarantine but they are not exhibiting any symptoms. Now, some sailors are exhibiting symptoms and some have been admitted to the hospital for treatment.</p><p>That number currently stands at eight, one of which is in the intensive care unit there. Of course that the sadly the Navy announced that a sailor last week, that a sailor died as a result of the coronavirus from that ship. But we are also learning new information about how the virus spread on that -- on that ship. That aircraft carrier. It's a massive ship, you know, 4800 sailors aboard it. One out of every 10 sailors now has the coronavirus. It began in the air crew we're being told that is the sailors who operate the aircraft and helicopters and jets on that ship and then spread from there. Now the Navy has taken steps to evacuate the ship. Some 4000 sailors have been moved into isolation and quarantine on Guam. And the Navy is preparing to announce the results of its investigation into the circumstances of Captain Brett Crozier, as you remember was fired after his warning about the spread of the virus on his ship became public.</p><p>The Navy conducting an investigation into that circumstances. We're expecting the results of that investigation to be announced soon and the Navy has not ruled out a possible reinstatement for Captain Crozier if he is cleared in this investigation. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: Reinstatement and that would -- that would put him reassigned even back on that aircraft carrier?</p><p>BROWNE: It is possible. Of course they would have to work out the mechanics, he has -- he is -- he's been in quarantine since being fired very publicly from his command. As they conduct this review, they would have to kind of work out the mechanics of that, of course, after he was fired the person who fired him, the acting Navy secretary was forced to resign over his handling of the situation. So, a lot of turmoil in the upper ranks of the Navy over this issue.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Uh-hmm. Any more clarity on the origins of the virus outbreak on the aircraft carrier?</p><p>BROWNE: So they know that it began -- the initial cases were members of the air crew, it is still not clear whether it came aboard the vessel during its port call in Vietnam. There were some cases of coronavirus in Vietnam when the ship pulled into port there. Some have speculated that that was where the virus came on board. However, the Navy has not been able to identify the source of the virus.</p><p>It is conducting a medical examination to determine more about how it's spread around the ship. But some officials are skeptical whether or not they'll ever be able to determine how that virus came on board.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Ryan Browne, thanks so much.</p><p>BROWNE: You bet.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Coming up. It helped and the Ebola outbreak and now contact tracing could help reopen America but what is it and how does it work?</p><p>Also ahead, health officials fighting back against the reopening of a mall in Nebraska. We'll go there live.</p><p>[13:17:47]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right now, former President Bill Clinton is holding a virtual global initiative with the governors from New York and California. They're discussing strategies for getting the outbreak under control and the challenges of reopening the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can get back to normal until we've got control of this virus, and we can keep it under control. And that might take longer than we wish. It's already taken longer than we wish. But there are a lot of moving parts, a lot of complicating factors, including in the United States, the various significant racial disparities and income disparities and exposure to the virus and in this mortality rate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Experts say there is a crucial step needed for a safe reopening of the country and that is contact tracing. And that means tracking down anyone, an infected patient might have come into contact with to contain the virus and to keep it from spreading. As CNN's Sara Sidner shows us from Los Angeles, it's not an easy task.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMY DRISCOLL, SURVIVED CORONAVIRUS: This was painful.</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Amy Driscoll says coronavirus had a her in a vise grip that wouldn't let go for weeks.</p><p>DRISCOLL: Every breath, every movement, every, you know, raising your arms, rolling over in bed, every single thing is painful.</p><p>SIDNER: Less than two hours after arriving home from the hospital, her phone rang. It was the county health department, asking lots of questions.</p><p>DRISCOLL: Who have I seen in the last two weeks, where was I in the last two weeks, who was I in contact with, where do I work.</p><p>SIDNER: The Health Department was doing what is called contact tracing.</p><p>CUOMO: You have to trace every person who comes up positive. Trace means investigate. Investigate all those prior contacts.</p><p>SIDNER: Driscoll traced her steps. She had gone to work. Her boss and staff had to be contacted.</p><p>She went to a restaurant for lunch. She went to her hair salon, they had to be contacted. She went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game. All the family members who sat with her were contacted.</p><p>This kind of contact tracing is happening across the country and the world.</p><p>[13:20:02]</p><p>SIDNER: From those suffering through the deadly COVID-19 outbreak in New York and those connected to the first major U.S. outbreak in Washington State, to California, the first place where a statewide stay-at-home order was announced.</p><p>Experts say without contract tracing and enough testing, America and the world cannot reopen safely.</p><p>JOSHUA MICHAUD, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY, KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION: We're going to be at risk of resurgence of this disease, not just in the fall, but going into next year.</p><p>SIDNER: So you're saying without contact tracing, a massive amount -- without testing a massive amount, we could find ourselves right back where we started?</p><p>MICHAUD: I think we could find ourselves very much at risk of another resurgence.</p><p>SIDNER: But the U.S. does not have enough people to do the tracing. State health officials estimate there are about 2,000 people doing this work now, but Johns Hopkins University warns we need at least 100,000.</p><p>SIDNER: For now, contact tracing is only as good as your memory. This is hard. I mean, before stay-at-home orders, can you remember all the people you had close contact with over a two-week period, say, at the coffee shop? Or at the grocery store? Or at a restaurant? Or at your child's school?</p><p>And that's where big tech like Google and Apple are jumping in. They will soon have an app you can voluntarily download built with health departments so they can see detailed location data from your cellphone. But the public may be skittish about it due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Still contact tracing requires serious legwork. L.A.'s mayor is pushing for Federal help.</p><p>ERIC GARCETTI (D), MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES: We're probably going to need hundreds of thousands of Americans to be put to work. It should be funded by the Feds by enacted locally.</p><p>SIDNER: As for Driscoll, her contacts have been found. The Health Department tells her that none have symptoms so far. But testing is still a problem.</p><p>DRISCOLL: I've had no additional testing.</p><p>SIDNER: Amy Driscoll told us that she was supposed to have two negative tests to make sure that she was no longer spreading the virus. Well, she's not going to have those tests, they simply don't have enough and it makes her worried to go back out into the community safely.</p><p>And as far as how important contact tracing is, the CDC announced just this week that they are starting a pilot program and sending out protection teams to eight states to try to help ramp up contact tracing.</p><p>Sara Sidner, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Meanwhile, an outlet mall in Nebraska is encouraging retailers to begin to open their doors this coming Friday despite a still growing number of coronavirus cases in that state. The malls owner encouraging major retailers to use the shopping center as an opportunity to determine best practices as they plan to reopen stores across the nation in the coming weeks. CNN's Ryan Young joining me now from Omaha. So, what more are you learning about their approach?</p><p>RYAN YOUNG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, Fred, look, there's a lot of people who just want to see things get back to normal. You can understand that at this point. People want to go back to shop and they want to go back to being a part of the retail industry. And of course, there are so many folks who work here. Hundreds of folks who work here, the owner was basically saying giving them a chance to get back to work would be a good thing.</p><p>Now here's the situation here though. If you think about it, there's a lot of major anchor tenants that are here. So just because you open them all back up doesn't mean some of the stories behind me will allow their employees to come back in. But what they're doing is they want to do a face sort of soft opening from what we were explained, like to bring some of the employees back so they can start setting up to set up the situation.</p><p>So, when people do come back, they can do social distancing. And they can allow certain numbers of people in at the same time. So that soft opening will give them a chance to be able to look at this. Now the hospital association in this state though, they are worried about an opening like this, they think it could be bad for flattening the curve in this area. In fact, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN NOONAN, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AND EDUCATION, NEBRASKA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION: It's premature, right? It's irresponsible. It's, you know, really, we just be patient for, you know, another -- I don't know if it's three to four weeks. I don't know. No one can predict the timeline. But again, we've got to listen to our scientists and our public health experts.</p><p>They are the ones who tracking this data and looking deeply into how it's spreading. So, we have to be confident that they know what they're doing. We've done a good job so far. So, you know, why stop short? We need keep continuing to be vigilant.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG: Yes, Fred. You can understand their ideas and the reason why they feel that way because obviously they're on the front lines of this pandemic. But to give you an idea of the state, you're talking about 1200 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the state.</p><p>They've had 24 deaths. That's not the same size numbers that we've seen across the country. In fact, you know, when I was talking to you last weekend, from Michigan, of course, those numbers would be this pale in comparison because -- compared to that state.</p><p>So when you think about this, you can understand what they're thinking about doing. But obviously, some of the health professionals are saying, hey, let's just wait a little bit longer. So far, though, it seems like the 24th when -- will -- is when this is going to all happen. And I'm sure people will sort of show up. In fact, even now, there are some people who are still at the mall right now sort of prepping things.</p><p>[13:25:06]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, we shall see. Ryan Young, thank you so much in Omaha, Nebraska.</p><p>All right. CNN viewers and readers from around the world have asked more than 90,000 questions about coronavirus on CNN.com. And at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time right here on CNN, a panel of experts will join me to answer some of your questions. Go to CNN.com to submit some of your questions on health, family life and your money. Again, that's 2:30 Eastern Time right here on CNN.</p><p>It's about the third weekend that we've been doing that and it has been hugely popular and people have felt very satisfied with getting lots of great answers.</p><p>All right, still ahead. Could a vaccine be in the works? The U.K. now launching a task force to examine one. A live update next.</p><p>[13:30:23]</p><p>WHITFIELD: As countries around the world scramble to find ways to fight the coronavirus outbreak, the U.K. says it is putting together a task force to focus on finding a vaccine. The announcement comes as the number of deaths from the virus in the U.K. has now passed 15,000 people.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson is with me from London.</p><p>Nic, we're learning about this task force but also learning today of some critical new shortages of medical gowns. What's the latest?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The government is saying in its briefing an hour or so ago that the medical gown shortage is acute. It's critical. They are recommending at the moment practice, which isn't normal practice.</p><p>The gowns that are in particular short supply could run out in hospitals this weekend. These are gowns that are fluid repellent. But the government is saying there's global shortage in supply. This is something we all know, and I think we've heard this from many leaders around the world at the moment.</p><p>But the olive branch, if you will, that the government is holding out for the health care professionals is that they are saying they should get 400,000 of these much-needed gowns in a shipment on Sunday coming from Turkey. It's a very hand-to-mouth situation, if you will, for the health care professionals on the front line.</p><p>The government minister today speaking at the press conference said he recognized this was a difficulty for some of those frontline professionals. I think perhaps that many people would agree that's an understatement. But the government is trying to keep on top of the personal protection equipment.</p><p>That issue about the vaccines, yes, a task force is being set up. It's very aspirational at the moment. Brings together government, academics and industry. Sets out all sorts of different aspirations that they want them to do to look at regulations and try to inspire new developments, $312 million. And things are on the drawing board but no actual vaccine inside at the moment.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Nic Robertson, in London, thanks so much.</p><p>Still ahead, the White House and congressional Democrats discussing adding tens of billions of dollars for hospitals as part of a small business package.</p><p>[13:36:47]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Live pictures right now out of Colorado Springs where the 62nd class will be enjoying its commencement ceremonies today. The vice president is the commencement speaker.</p><p>And you are seeing there the distancing between the cadets. Apparently, six feet apart in their marching. And the same will be the case in the seating arrangement you see right now. The vice president there on stage. And we have been assured that there's social distancing taking place on the stage there as well.</p><p>We'll continue to monitor the developments and the commencement address coming from the vice president.</p><p>And this just into CNN. Amid an impasse to renew funding for the country's small business loan program, we're learning about a new bipartisan effort between the White House and congressional Democrats to provide funding for hospitals. A source tells us that a deal could be reached as early as Monday.</p><p>CNN's Phil Mattingly has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Millions of small businesses are hanging by a thread as the coronavirus continues to devastate the U.S. economy. MICHAEL CERBELLI, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, CERBELLI CREATIVE : Our industry is hurting right now.</p><p>MATTINGLY: And the financial lifeline signed into law to help them has officially been severed.</p><p>(SHOUTING)</p><p>MATTINGLY: Michael Cerbelli has been producing corporate and social events for 43 years. He's committed to paying his seven employees through the crisis.</p><p>CERBELLI: The past 30 days, we've been busting our butts, taking everything from the back burner, bringing it to the front, working hard, preparing with our clients, but now, I got to tell you, today, I'm a little scared.</p><p>MATTINGLY: But the Small Business Administration has now exhausted its $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program leaving lenders and borrowers alike to see this message: In just 13 days, the agency approved more loans than it had in the 14 years prior combined. Data that underscores the level of urgency and devastation small business owners, like Cerbelli, currently face. But also the limbo they now find themselves in.</p><p>CERBELLI: I turn to my bank today and, excuse my English, but I said, am I screwed, am I getting the short end of the stick. And they said, unfortunately, you're still in the queue. You never made it to that next phase.</p><p>MATTINGLY: More than 800,000 applications were awaiting approval when the funds ran out. Those business owners have no idea what's coming next. And their eyes are on Congress.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY): Every Senate Republican was ready to act today. Today. But Democrats would not let us reopen the program.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Republicans and Democrats are locked in a stalemate as they try and add funds to the program. Republicans pushing for an immediate and clean additional $250 billion. Democrats blocking that effort and countering there are other urgent needs as well.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY: I want to help small business. But if we don't deal with the testing and health care problems, if we don't deal with the local government problems, small business may have enough money to get back, but there will be -- people won't go out on the streets.</p><p>MATTINGLY: For small business owners, the details of that negotiation and how it ends up are the least of their worries. They just want a resolution.</p><p>[13:40:05]</p><p>CERBELLI: We are asking you to please remember us, the live events industry, the caterers, the hospitality people that bring life to the world. We are not celebrating right now. We are asking just for help.</p><p>MATTINGLY (on camera): For small business owners looking for that help, looking for that resolution on Capitol Hill, right now, talks are still ongoing between Democrats and Republicans, Democrats and the Trump administration. And there were even proposals traded as late as Friday night.</p><p>The reality is this: Both parties agree that the money needs to be replenished. More money needs to go into the small business program.</p><p>The question, right now, at least as it currently stands, is what else needs to be added to get agreement and can that agreement get support of both sides, pretty much every member in both chambers. That's what lawmakers are working toward and through this weekend.</p><p>The goal, I'm told, at the moment, is to have an agreement and to be able to move forward with that agreement as soon as Monday. But they're not there yet. Still negotiations ongoing.</p><p>Phil Mattingly, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: President John F. Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs. How could that historical event possibly relate to Trump's response to this pandemic? Presidential historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin, lays it all out for us, next.</p><p>[13:45:52]</p><p>WHITFIELD: After declaring that he would be the one to reopen the U.S. economy, President Trump now says governors will have the authority to reopen their states once they meet certain criteria.</p><p>The about-face also highlights the tensions between the president and the governors where he has, at times, praised but more often blame forward failures in the fight against the coronavirus.</p><p>Is there historical precedence for the way this president is handling the crisis?</p><p>Doris Kearns Goodwin is a presidential historian and Pulitzer-prize- winning author of the book, \"Leadership in Turbulent Times.\"</p><p>Good to see you, Doris. Always love having you because</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: -- you either help us see things differently or just help us see things, period.</p><p>So let's begin this way. The president is calling for more protests against social distancing guidelines all in states with Democratic governors, we should note. One of the historical parallels you draw here is John F. Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs. Why that comparison?</p><p>DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN &amp; AUTHOR: It may seem weird on the surface, but the most important trait of leadership in a time of crisis is to assume responsibility, to acknowledge failures, and learn from your mistakes.</p><p>And that's precisely what JFK did during the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs when he stood before the people and said, this is a kick in the leg but I'm not going to shift blame on others, and I'm going to learn from this.</p><p>And learning from that meant he restructured the White House. He was in a much better situation when the far more important crisis came of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He grew in office.</p><p>You can't do that by shifting blame to others, not taking responsibility and not learning from your mistakes, which we need so badly right now.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So FDR, when he was governor of New York, you know, he stepped in, provided unemployment relief and, you know, the state's jobs helped considerably when there was this vacuum on the federal level. And his success with that helped him win the presidency.</p><p>What was it about him that appealed to so many, and really ended up answering the call?</p><p>GOODWIN: I think it's almost the same thing again. He was willing to say, I will take this gift of leadership, when he was finally elected to the presidency, and I will assume responsibility for taking action.</p><p>And then he took unprecedented steps. He put millions of people to work. He created the first kind of safety net. He eventually created Social Security. I mean, all the things that had not been done before, which he knew were unprecedented, he was willing to put on his shoulders.</p><p>The interesting thing to think about is that governors used to be the main role into the presidency. Seventeen of our presidents were governors because they had executive experience. They were on the ground.</p><p>And I keep wondering, what might it have been like if this virus occurred last fall when more of those who ran for governor or more other governors had been in the mix when we came to the end of the Democratic primary.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Forgive me if I'm redundant because I lost audio for a second. As I ask you a question, you may have already answered this one.</p><p>So for FDR, you know, to have led the U.S. during the Great Depression and World War II, you know, when you look at today's food lines, for example, I mean, these images are extraordinary of what we've seen in the past couple of weeks. And then you hear the current surgeon general saying a week in this pandemic is tantamount to Pearl Harbor.</p><p>What parallels or perhaps even contrasts do you see in this crisis, the consequences and/or the leadership styles?</p><p>GOODWIN: You know, the vision that I keep hoping will come out of this crisis is that, just as FDR initially dealt with the problems of the Great Depression, you know, by providing relief and providing jobs, he then argued that there was systemic problems that had caused the Great Depression in the first place, and we had to address those.</p><p>[13:50:11]</p><p>And so that's when he began to regulate the stock market to provide safety nets, to provide Social Security.</p><p>So I look now at where we are in the pandemic, and lots of issues were discussed during the election campaign, but they seemed abstract and maybe too far removed.</p><p>But now we see people going to those food pantries, just as you say, long lines of people, which made me understand that people living paycheck to paycheck. What can we do about that? Can we have a greater minimum wage?</p><p>We see people who risk their lives to go vote in Wisconsin. What is that necessary for? Can't we have some better system of voting by mail or a national holiday or a whole bunch of days when we vote for our presidents?</p><p>We've seen the discrimination evidently against African Americans that have made them bear this crisis more than others. What are we going to do about housing and overcrowding and the kinds of jobs they have? All of these things we're feeling viscerally.</p><p>Even the idea of climate change, we've seen what difference it makes when we, as individuals, have not polluted, when birds are coming back and wildlife is flourishing. What if we could make individual actions which would help climate change in the future?</p><p>Sometimes crises like this can produce big change. If we need a positive vision, if we could make society more socially and economically just, it would be something to look forward to. And we need it in these moments.</p><p>WHITFIELD: This president, have you seen him fully exert his power or have you seen him cede, relinquish his power more than one might expect?</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, it's been such a contradictory journey because, at times, he claimed authority over all the states to determine when they would re-open, and now he has left it to the states to determine when they re-open but, yet, is giving guidance to the people by suggesting we should liberate Minnesota, liberate Michigan.</p><p>What you really need is just clear-headed assumption of national responsibility. You know, I think about how much is needed. We keep talking about testing, testing, testing. At the beginning, before we were even in World War II, we were so far behind Germany. We had only 400 fighter planes.</p><p>In that first spring of 1940, FDR said, I'm setting a target this year. We're going to have 50,000 planes produced. People said that's impossible. You'll never get it done. He said, I believe when the people are given a challenge in this country, they will meet it.</p><p>And he formed a partnership with the business community, who produced terrifically during the war, 300,000 planes eventually, you know, millions of tanks and weapons that we were able to give our allies in all the far corners of the world.</p><p>But it took taking that responsibility to set a target and then shoulder the blame if we didn't meet it. But he knew that together the people would meet it. I still believe that. If we were to mobilize the business community now even more to produce the swabs and everything we need, they would come through.</p><p>People want to be together. We're in it together. It is not the federal government versus the states. It's all of us together in this thing.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes.</p><p>GOODWIN: That is the only way we will succeed in making this pandemic end and doing something great that comes out of it.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Doris Kearns Goodwin, that sounds like the national plan that people keep saying they want to hear. They want to hear something that equates to a national plan.</p><p>All right. Thank you so much. Great to see you. Appreciate it.</p><p>GOODWIN: Absolutely.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Be well.</p><p>GOODWIN: You, too. Thank you.</p><p>[13:53:28]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Vice President Pence is about to speak at the 2020 graduates ceremony of the U.S. Air Academy. We'll bring that to you live as soon as it happens.</p><p>[13:58:28]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hello, again. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.</p><p>We begin this hour with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo renewing his calls for aggressive testing in the battle against the coronavirus. The governor saying his state is not at the stage where it can begin to reopen the economy. And he insists that widespread testing in the number-one factor needed to get people back to work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: Testing. Testing is the single-most important topic for us to understand I think. And it's important that we understand it. The more you test, the more information, the more you can re-open society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: But some states are beginning to loosen their restrictions. Right now, in Jacksonville, Florida, people are flocking to the beaches.</p><p>And there are new signs about the toll the shutdown is having on the economy. Many of President Trump's own properties are beginning to furlough hundreds of workers.</p><p>The White House is set to give another coronavirus briefing today, 5:00. We'll bring that to you live as it happens.</p><p>Let's get started in New York where Governor Andrew Cuomo says new deaths and hospitalizations are down but still high. The state is reporting more than 500 new deaths, 2,000 new hospitalizations. This, as the governor offers a sobering outlook on when the state could re- open.</p><p>CNN's Evan McMorris-Santoro is in New York.</p><p>Evan, what does the governor say has to happen before things can re- open again?</p><p>[14:00:01]</p><p>EVAN MCMORRIS-SANTORO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, the governor opened his conference today talking about the hospitalizations that you mentioned that are down and, you know, the focus on the future that everybody is having now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020041804CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPH-WWJ1-JB20-G0YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp; PREVENTION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Deaths</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vaccines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pharmaceuticals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Small Business Administration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paycheck Protection Program</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Businesses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment and Unemployment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mitch McConnell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chuck Schumer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>History</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John F.

I'm in the Roche headquarters in Basel and I'm joined by the CEO of Roche, Severin Schwan. Great to have you with us, Mr. Schwan, and nice to see you today. A good for you then. First quarter revenue beat, you also raised your forecast for sales this year. Market not reacting too positively though. The shares is a little changed off ever so slightly slightly. I wonder if it's to do with the themes around my first question, which is that sales rose 15% in the U.S. but dropped 7% in Europe. Is this going to widen this gap between the U.S. and Europe?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  Well, we started strongly into the new year. We had an overall sales growth of 6%, and as you rightly point out, a very different dynamics in the United States and in Europe. And the reason is that we have launched our new medicines, such as Ocrevus or Perjeta, already in the U.S. The rest will only come to the market later in Europe. So actually the contrary is the case that, overtime, what we will is that the new launches in Europe will also compensate for reentry of the (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  In that sense, do you see Europe catching up to the U.S. in terms of sales rather than U.S. sales dropping to match Europe as, for example, U.S. customers favor biosimilars of your older drugs which seems to be what's happening in Europe?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  Actually, both are true. We will see a bit of decline in the growth rate in the United States as the biosimilars enter the market. And at the same time, we will see an uptake of the new medicines in Europe. We will have different dynamics. There's a different timing here. But overall, based on the successful launch of the new medicines, I'm very confident to see continued to growth for the coop (ph) during this transition phase.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  So overall, you're saying U.S. sales might plateau slightly, Europe sales might pick up?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  No, plateau is not the right word. Given this strong launch of medicines, like Ocravus, for example, we will see continued to growth in the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Now there's been a flurry of M&amp;A activity in the rare drugs and biotech sector at the beginning of this year. Would Roche be open to a large deal to boost part of its portfolio, for example, in hemophilia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  We won't change our M&amp;A strategy. Our M&amp;A strategy has always been about bolt-on acquisitions, where we look out for specific products or technologies to complement our portfolio and we will continue to do so. And experience shows that the vast majority of our transactions are at early stage assets because that's typically where we can add more value for shareholders.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes. You have said though that it's quite difficult to find these M&amp;A opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions. Are you looking anywhere specifically in any areas?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  We focus very much on our two-core businesses, pharmaceuticals and diagnostic. And it's a mixed of products, medicines, for example, and new technologies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Is the industry, in general, after the flurry at the beginning of this year, gearing up for more big mergers?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  We'll see. There is a lot of activity at this stage. Actually, we also did an acquisition towards the end of last year, a company called Ignyta in oncology space. But again, whatever is happening in the industry as a whole, our specific strategy of bolt-on acquisitions will not change.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Right. And you also said -- you expect U.S. tax cuts to boost profit this year. Will that fully up more cash for bolt-on acquisitions and how much cast are we talking about that you'd have at your disposal?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  I wouldn't link the benefits we have from the tax reform with our acquisition strategy. What is true is that this will generate additional cash. But again, I would not link that to the M&amp;A strategy. When we go for an acquisition, the acquisition has to make sense in itself. It's not a matter of how much cash you have available. The key question is, can you generate additional value with this acquisition? And this is a question which is independent of the specific cash flow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  So you say the acquisition have to make sense. I believe you bought three tech companies in the past ten months or so. Would more tech companies make sense?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  Now, that certainly the case is what we see in healthcare now is finally also this industry is digitized. I mean, really, the healthcare is behind other industries such as media or retail or many others. But now, a patient data more and more digitized. And as a consequence of that, we can analyze this kind of data, the new analytics tools available, and that will help us to develop better medicines and also to improve patient care. And that's also by we look out for respective partnerships or acquisitions in the space.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  So could you buy more tech companies this year?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  Well, typically, I would say, it's a matter of partnerships. It's less about acquisitions. We did an acquisition with Flatiron at the beginning of this year, but typically, what we see is partnerships.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Are you concerned though generally about competition from the big tech giants, for example, like Amazon and Alibaba?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHWAN</emphasis>:  No. I think it's an opportunity to partner, to work together. And we do have partnerships with tech companies. We bring in different capabilities. Tech companies are traditionally extremely good in managing data, big data, and our strength, around the medical understanding of diseases the regulatory environment. So I see this is a very complementary skill set.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Severin Schwann, CEO of Roche, thank you so much for joining us on Bloomberg TV.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6H-7X91-JDPT-T32P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

I'm in the Roche headquarters in Basel and I'm joined by the CEO of Roche, Severin Schwan. Great to have you with us, Mr. Schwan, and nice to see you today. A good for you then. First quarter revenue beat, you also raised your forecast for sales this year. Market not reacting too positively though. The shares is a little changed off ever so slightly slightly. I wonder if it's to do with the themes around my first question, which is that sales rose 15% in the U.S. but dropped 7% in Europe. Is this going to widen this gap between the U.S. and Europe?</p><p>SEVERIN SCHWAN, CEO, ROCHE: Well, we started strongly into the new year. We had an overall sales growth of 6%, and as you rightly point out, a very different dynamics in the United States and in Europe. And the reason is that we have launched our new medicines, such as Ocrevus or Perjeta, already in the U.S. The rest will only come to the market later in Europe. So actually the contrary is the case that, overtime, what we will is that the new launches in Europe will also compensate for reentry of the (inaudible).</p><p>CEHIC: In that sense, do you see Europe catching up to the U.S. in terms of sales rather than U.S. sales dropping to match Europe as, for example, U.S. customers favor biosimilars of your older drugs which seems to be what's happening in Europe?</p><p>SCHWAN: Actually, both are true. We will see a bit of decline in the growth rate in the United States as the biosimilars enter the market. And at the same time, we will see an uptake of the new medicines in Europe. We will have different dynamics. There's a different timing here. But overall, based on the successful launch of the new medicines, I'm very confident to see continued to growth for the coop (ph) during this transition phase.</p><p>CEHIC: So overall, you're saying U.S. sales might plateau slightly, Europe sales might pick up?</p><p>SCHWAN: No, plateau is not the right word. Given this strong launch of medicines, like Ocravus, for example, we will see continued to growth in the United States.</p><p>CEHIC: Now there's been a flurry of M&amp;A activity in the rare drugs and biotech sector at the beginning of this year. Would Roche be open to a large deal to boost part of its portfolio, for example, in hemophilia?</p><p>SCHWAN: We won't change our M&amp;A strategy. Our M&amp;A strategy has always been about bolt-on acquisitions, where we look out for specific products or technologies to complement our portfolio and we will continue to do so. And experience shows that the vast majority of our transactions are at early stage assets because that's typically where we can add more value for shareholders.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. You have said though that it's quite difficult to find these M&amp;A opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions. Are you looking anywhere specifically in any areas?</p><p>SCHWAN: We focus very much on our two-core businesses, pharmaceuticals and diagnostic. And it's a mixed of products, medicines, for example, and new technologies.</p><p>CEHIC: Is the industry, in general, after the flurry at the beginning of this year, gearing up for more big mergers?</p><p>SCHWAN: We'll see. There is a lot of activity at this stage. Actually, we also did an acquisition towards the end of last year, a company called Ignyta in oncology space. But again, whatever is happening in the industry as a whole, our specific strategy of bolt-on acquisitions will not change.</p><p>CEHIC: Right. And you also said -- you expect U.S. tax cuts to boost profit this year. Will that fully up more cash for bolt-on acquisitions and how much cast are we talking about that you'd have at your disposal?</p><p>SCHWAN: I wouldn't link the benefits we have from the tax reform with our acquisition strategy. What is true is that this will generate additional cash. But again, I would not link that to the M&amp;A strategy. When we go for an acquisition, the acquisition has to make sense in itself. It's not a matter of how much cash you have available. The key question is, can you generate additional value with this acquisition? And this is a question which is independent of the specific cash flow.</p><p>CEHIC: So you say the acquisition have to make sense. I believe you bought three tech companies in the past ten months or so. Would more tech companies make sense?</p><p>SCHWAN: Now, that certainly the case is what we see in healthcare now is finally also this industry is digitized. I mean, really, the healthcare is behind other industries such as media or retail or many others. But now, a patient data more and more digitized. And as a consequence of that, we can analyze this kind of data, the new analytics tools available, and that will help us to develop better medicines and also to improve patient care. And that's also by we look out for respective partnerships or acquisitions in the space.</p><p>CEHIC: So could you buy more tech companies this year?</p><p>SCHWAN: Well, typically, I would say, it's a matter of partnerships. It's less about acquisitions. We did an acquisition with Flatiron at the beginning of this year, but typically, what we see is partnerships.</p><p>CEHIC: Are you concerned though generally about competition from the big tech giants, for example, like Amazon and Alibaba?</p><p>SCHWAN: No. I think it's an opportunity to partner, to work together. And we do have partnerships with tech companies. We bring in different capabilities. Tech companies are traditionally extremely good in managing data, big data, and our strength, around the medical understanding of diseases the regulatory environment. So I see this is a very complementary skill set.</p><p>CEHIC: Severin Schwann, CEO of Roche, thank you so much for joining us on Bloomberg TV.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And the reason is  that we have launched our new medicines, such as Ocrevus or Perjeta,  already in the U.S. The rest will only come to the market later in Europe.  So actually the contrary is the case that, overtime, what we will is that  the new launches in Europe will also compensate for reentry of the  (inaudible).</p><p>CEHIC: In that sense, do you see Europe catching up to the U.S. in terms of  sales rather than U.S. sales dropping to match Europe as, for example, U.S.  customers favor biosimilars of your older drugs which seems to be what's  happening in Europe?</p><p>SCHWAN: Actually, both are true. We will see a bit of decline in the growth  rate in the United States as the biosimilars enter the market. And at the  same time, we will see an uptake of the new medicines in Europe. We will  have different dynamics. There's a different timing here. But overall,  based on the successful launch of the new medicines, I'm very confident to  see continued to growth for the coop (ph) during this transition phase.</p><p>CEHIC: So overall, you're saying U.S. sales might plateau slightly, Europe  sales might pick up?</p><p>SCHWAN: No, plateau is not the right word. Given this strong launch of  medicines, like Ocravus, for example, we will see continued to growth in  the United States.</p><p>CEHIC: Now there's been a flurry of M&amp;A activity in the rare drugs and  biotech sector at the beginning of this year. Would Roche be open to a  large deal to boost part of its portfolio, for example, in hemophilia?</p><p>SCHWAN: We won't change our M&amp;A strategy. Our M&amp;A strategy has always been  about bolt-on acquisitions, where we look out for specific products or  technologies to complement our portfolio and we will continue to do so. And  experience shows that the vast majority of our transactions are at early  stage assets because that's typically where we can add more value for  shareholders.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. You have said though that it's quite difficult to find these  M&amp;A opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions. Are you looking anywhere  specifically in any areas?</p><p>SCHWAN: We focus very much on our two-core businesses, pharmaceuticals and  diagnostic. And it's a mixed of products, medicines, for example, and new  technologies.</p><p>CEHIC: Is the industry, in general, after the flurry at the beginning of  this year, gearing up for more big mergers?</p><p>SCHWAN: We'll see. There is a lot of activity at this stage. Actually, we  also did an acquisition towards the end of last year, a company called  Ignyta in oncology space. But again, whatever is happening in the industry  as a whole, our specific strategy of bolt-on acquisitions will not change.</p><p>CEHIC: Right. And you also said -- you expect U.S. tax cuts to boost profit  this year. Will that fully up more cash for bolt-on acquisitions and how  much cast are we talking about that you'd have at your disposal?</p><p>SCHWAN: I wouldn't link the benefits we have from the tax reform with our  acquisition strategy. What is true is that this will generate additional  cash. But again, I would not link that to the M&amp;A strategy. When we go for  an acquisition, the acquisition has to make sense in itself. It's not a  matter of how much cash you have available. The key question is, can you  generate additional value with this acquisition? And this is a question  which is independent of the specific cash flow.</p><p>CEHIC: So you say the acquisition have to make sense. I believe you bought  three tech companies in the past ten months or so. Would more tech  companies make sense?</p><p>SCHWAN: Now, that certainly the case is what we see in healthcare now is  finally also this industry is digitized. I mean, really, the healthcare is  behind other industries such as media or retail or many others. But now, a  patient data more and more digitized. And as a consequence of that, we can  analyze this kind of data, the new analytics tools available, and that will  help us to develop better medicines and also to improve patient care. And  that's also by we look out for respective partnerships or acquisitions in  the space.</p><p>CEHIC: So could you buy more tech companies this year?</p><p>SCHWAN: Well, typically, I would say, it's a matter of partnerships. It's  less about acquisitions. We did an acquisition with Flatiron at the  beginning of this year, but typically, what we see is partnerships.</p><p>CEHIC: Are you concerned though generally about competition from the big  tech giants, for example, like Amazon and Alibaba?</p><p>SCHWAN: No. I think it's an opportunity to partner, to work together. And  we do have partnerships with tech companies. We bring in different  capabilities. Tech companies are traditionally extremely good in managing  data, big data, and our strength, around the medical understanding of  diseases the regulatory environment. So I see this is a very complementary  skill set.</p><p>CEHIC: Severin Schwann, CEO of Roche, thank you so much for joining us on  Bloomberg TV.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

I'm in the Roche headquarters in  Basel and I'm joined by the CEO of Roche, Severin Schwan. Great to have you  with us, Mr. Schwan, and nice to see you today. A good for you then. First  quarter revenue beat, you also raised your forecast for sales this year.  Market not reacting too positively though. The shares is a little changed  off ever so slightly slightly. I wonder if it's to do with the themes  around my first question, which is that sales rose 15% in the U.S. but  dropped 7% in Europe. Is this going to widen this gap between the U.S. and  Europe?</p><p> SEVERIN SCHWAN, CEO, ROCHE: Well, we started strongly into the new year. We  had an overall sales growth of 6%, and as you rightly point out, a very  different dynamics in the United States and in Europe. And the reason is  that we have launched our new medicines, such as Ocrevus or Perjeta,  already in the U.S. The rest will only come to the market later in Europe.

A couple of months ago, the big consumer tech company launched what seemed to be a very clever marketing gimmick -- an Apple-branded credit card that could be used only in conjunction with its iPhones and its Apple Pay service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It seemed a foolproof way to beef up purchases of iPhones and enrollment in Apple Pay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now comes the backfire. Several Apple Card customers -- including, most embarrassingly, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak -- have complained publicly that the credit limits set for the card seem to discriminate against women, even when their finances are jointly held with their spouses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And there seems to be no one to talk to for an appeal. Not at Apple, nor at Goldman Sachs, the giant investment bank that is actually running the card for Apple.</p><p>Wozniak, who is no longer associated with Apple management, tweeted that he was granted a credit limit 10 times the size of his wife's. \"We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets,\" he stated. \"Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.\"</p><p>New York State financial regulators are looking into the situation. Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the state's Department of Financial Services, dismissed out of hand Goldman Sachs' defense that the credit limits are scored by an algorithm that scores individual creditworthiness.</p><p>\"New York law prohibits discrimination against protected classes of individuals, which means an algorithm, as with any other method of determining creditworthiness, cannot result in disparate treatment for individuals based on age, creed, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected characteristics,\" Lacewell stated in a post on Medium.</p><p>The controversy over the card took flight last Thursday, when a software entrepreneur named David Hansson tweeted that the card was a \"sexist program.\" He described it rather more profanely, which is why his tweet can't be published here. But it went on to specify that \"my wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work.\"</p><p>He added that his wife experienced further restrictions on her card spending. \"Nobody is authorized to discuss the credit assessment process. No opportunity to present evidence. Just a 'sorry, your wife is deemed to be 1/20th the credit worth you are, check again in 6 months!' \" (Six months is the minimum Goldman says it requires to consider requests for higher credit limits.)</p><p>Others chimed in on Hansson's Twitter thread, notably Wozniak.</p><p>What may be worst for Apple is that the blowup has exposed the truth about the Apple Card: First and foremost, this isn't an \"Apple\" card. Under the hood, it's a Goldman Sachs card, with Apple branding. Goldman Sachs is responsible for establishing the credit lines for individual applicants and provides the \"credit platform\" backing the card -- in other words, it's backed by Goldman's money.</p><p>Apple isn't all that forthright about its relationship with Goldman Sachs. \"To create a different kind of card, we worked with a different kind of partner,\" it says on its product page, hailing Goldman as \"a partner that was up for the challenge of doing something bold and innovative.\"</p><p>Well, good lord, Goldman Sachs is one of the largest and oldest investment banks on Wall Street that does most things in the same old way, just better than many of its rivals. This is a \"bold and innovative\" partner?</p><p>Apple's card marketing is plainly built around the idea of yoking the company's cultish relationship with its customers to what is, on the surface, a mostly conventional credit card. The product has a couple of tweaks, though not all are entirely novel.</p><p>There's no annual fee, which is hardly unique in the credit card world. It offers rebates on purchases -- 3% on Apple products and those at merchants such as T-Mobile that have made deals with Apple, 2% on anything bought with Apple Pay, 1% on everything else. That's also not novel.</p><p>If you miss a payment, Apple won't charge a late fee, though interest will still accrue. That's good, but the interest on unpaid balances ranges from 12.74% to 23.74%, based on users' credit history, which is no particular bargain. Apple Card also comes with privacy and security enhancements tied to your iPhone.</p><p>Apple brags that there are \"no fees. Not even hidden ones.\" Is that so?</p><p>Card users must have an iPhone running the latest system software, which rules out some of the older iPhone models. But since the new iPhone can cost up to $1,099, and even those a few generations old still run more than $400, that could be regarded as a pretty significant hidden fee.</p><p>Indeed, the requirement that each Apple Card user have an individual iPhone and therefore an individual account is what's gotten Apple into trouble. Most traditional credit card accounts allow for multiple \"authorized users,\" typically family members, to share an account and piggyback on each other's credit ratings. There may be slight differences in credit scores, but probably not dramatic ones.</p><p>Not the Apple Card. Apple says \"Goldman Sachs uses your income and the minimum payment amounts associated with your existing debt to assess your ability to pay\" in setting an applicant's initial credit limit. \"In addition, Goldman Sachs uses many of the same factors that are used to assess whether your application is approved or declined, including your credit score and the amount of credit you utilize on your existing credit lines.\"</p><p>Apple refers all questions about these issues to Goldman, which told me by email: \"We look at ... factors like personal credit scores, how much debt you have, and how that debt has been managed. Based on these factors, it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions.\"</p><p>Goldman specifically says \"in all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender.\"</p><p>Yet applicants really have no clue to what factors Goldman actually uses to assess their creditworthiness or how it weighs those factors. The weighing is placed in the hands of the all-powerful algorithm, which doesn't seem amenable to appeal.</p><p>As New York's Lacewell observes, the fact that these judgments are left to an automated formula doesn't excuse the bank from responsibility for how the judgment is made.</p><p>Nor does it guarantee that the judgment will be gender- or race-neutral.</p><p>Lacewell noted that her agency has launched an investigation into whether an algorithm developed and marketed by UnitedHealth Group has a discriminatory effect that harms black patients' access to healthcare. The effect was identified by researchers at UC Berkeley.</p><p>The reason may be that algorithms, for all that they're supposedly based on artificial intelligence, rely on inputs from the real world that may reflect long-embedded discrimination against women or minority groups.</p><p>Outsourcing potentially discriminatory judgments to a machine won't excuse its human developers, Lacewell warned. \"Financial service companies are responsible for ensuring the algorithms they use do not even unintentionally discriminate against protected groups.\"</p><p>In other words, Apple and Goldman Sachs may have just discovered the limits of technology.</p><p>--</p><p>Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government\u2019s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>With passage of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act</url>, Silicon Valley\u2019s ability to stay out of the government\u2019s reach suffered a rare setback.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/online-sex-trafficking-bill.html\">The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month</url>, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law.</p><p>\u201cThe president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. \u201cThis is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it\u2019s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was \u201ccracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, it\u2019s sex trafficking,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd down the road, it\u2019s content from foreign governments.\u201d</p><p>Internet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.</p><p>But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.</p><p>The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.</p><p>\u201cThis is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it\u2019s required,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.\u201d</p><p>When it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.</p><p>The law \u201cwould almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,\u201d said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.</p><p>But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies \u2014 no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking \u2014 retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.</p><p>The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.</p><p>\u201cThe internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.</p><p>The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re opening the courthouse doors,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday\u2019s vote.</p><p>According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.</p><p>But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that \u201cacknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims\u2019 trafficking\u201d but were \u201cpowerless to act,\u201d Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.</p><p>The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: \u201cThe big guys can take care of themselves.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.</p><p>Dozens of victims\u2019 advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.</p><p>\u201cThis is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,\u201d said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. \u201cThey will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, was a co-author of the sex trafficking bill that passed the Senate by a 97-to-2 vote.

Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government's oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>  With passage of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley's ability to stay out of the government's reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is expected to sign it into law.</p><p>  ''The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,'' the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.</p><p>  ''It's a wake-up call,'' said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. ''This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it's not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.''</p><p>  Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was ''cracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.''</p><p>  ''Today, it's sex trafficking,'' he added. ''And down the road, it's content from foreign governments.''</p><p>  Internet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.</p><p>  But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.</p><p>  The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.</p><p>  ''This is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it's required,'' said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ''The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.''</p><p>  When it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.</p><p>  The law ''would almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,'' said Robyn Green, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.</p><p>  But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies -- no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking -- retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.</p><p>  The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.</p><p>  ''The internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,'' said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.</p><p>  The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</p><p>  ''We're opening the courthouse doors,'' Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday's vote.</p><p>  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.</p><p>  But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that ''acknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims' trafficking'' but were ''powerless to act,'' Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.</p><p>  The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.</p><p>  On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.</p><p>  ''It'll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,'' Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: ''The big guys can take care of themselves.''</p><p>  Mr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.</p><p>  Dozens of victims' advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.</p><p>  ''This is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,'' said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims' rights. ''They will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-119148180322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXN-53M1-DXY4-X2YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/sex-trafficking-bill-senate.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/sex-trafficking-bill-senate.html</url><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The legislation weakens Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a provision that limits the legal liability of online platforms such as Google and Facebook for content posted by their users. In so doing, the bill which tracks closely to a popular Senate bill, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act greatly increases the ability of victims and state attorneys general to sue platforms if their users facilitate or participate in online sex trafficking.</p><p>FOSTA has already passed the House, is extremely popular in the Senate, and is virtually guaranteed to be signed into law by President Trump. Many tech companies and advocacy groups that first opposed the legislation, including Facebook and the Internet Association, later dropped their complaints in the face of withering criticism.</p><p>When big tech first backed down last year, some observers<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/660401/why-big-tech-backed-down-sex-trafficking-legislation\"> speculated </url> that sex trafficking was just too emotional an issue for tech platforms or politicians to oppose, and that FOSTA was little more than an aberrant setback for Silicon Valley on Capitol Hill.</p><p>But as concerns over the behavior of online platforms keep piling up, lawmakers are now touting FOSTA as the first of many axes to fall.</p><p> I think it s an important piece of legislation, because I think it does establish that we re serious about clamping down on this kind of bad behavior,  said John Thune, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The senator specifically mentioned the  activities of social-media platforms with respect to the elections,  but added that  everything else  was also fair game.</p><p>That means the fallout from terrorist content, shady political ads, and nonconsensual pornography all of which are routinely posted on a variety of online platforms could soon be laid at the feet of the platforms themselves. Experts say that will likely raise a variety of free-speech concerns, worsen the online experience for law-abiding users, and potentially price smaller tech platforms out of business.</p><p> Now Congress thinks it has all the answers, and it s about to tell the internet how it can best run itself,  said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a leading expert on online liability.  That should make most of us pretty nervous, because the odds of Congress getting things right is low. </p><p>Thune s growing skepticism of the tech platforms is shared by many of his Democratic colleagues. On Monday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he hoped FOSTA  will be the start of other conversations particularly now that we see what has happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and a clear need for more laws that protect privacy. </p><p>Mark Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is also warning tech platforms that there may be more shoes to drop.  The companies cannot continue to say  not our job,   he<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnjFzXdBOE\"> said </url> during a talk at the South by Southwest technology festival earlier this month.  Or you will see not only Section 230, changes which will require some responsibility for the content but you will see even more. So let s get our act together. </p><p>Even some of tech s erstwhile defenders now say FOSTA may be just the beginning. Sen. Ron Wyden has railed against the bill for months, arguing that it s more likely to incentivize online platforms into turning a blind eye toward sex-trafficking content altogether.</p><p>But when asked last week whether the tech platforms would face additional regulation, Wyden didn t mince words.  The idea that somehow the companies have these neutral pipes is not a view I share,  he said.  They blew it on the 2016 election, and if they don t step up to their responsibilities on a host of these social issues, the bill that may come to the Senate floor will not be the only one. </p><p>Even without new laws, there s widespread concern that FOSTA s weakening of Section 230 will give regulators and prosecutors too much power to police types of online content unrelated to sex trafficking.</p><p> These platforms will be exposed to significantly more liability for what their users do with their service, and will create an incentive to review, censor, or disallow user comments a loss for free speech online,  said Karen Gullo, a spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  The silencing effect that FOSTA would have on online speech goes well beyond the narrow slices of the internet that the bill's supporters claim it targets. </p><p>But tech experts also believe that FOSTA paves the way for new legislation mandating further platform liability. Berin Szoka, the president of libertarian tech group TechFreedom, said lawmakers have made it clear that the bill  is just the beginning of a broader push to make online intermediaries responsible for policing user content. </p><p>Congress is opening a Pandora s box of internet regulation,  Szoka warned.</p><p>So far, lawmakers are reserving most of their ire for sprawling tech platforms like Google and Facebook, which often appear to operate with near-impunity.</p><p>But while online behemoths like Facebook can hire scores of employees to try to moderate content and ensure compliance, that won t be the case for smaller platforms offering innovative new products. Goldman worries that increasing liability for user-posted content won t only fail to prevent illegal activity  it could cripple innovation online.</p><p> If Congress is concerned about the consolidated power of Google and Facebook, Section 230 is actually part of the solution,  he said.

What happens when the irresistible force  of the #MeToo Movement runs into the immovable object of partisan politics.   I speak to #MeToo founder, Tarana Burke, and to Ana Maria Archila, whose  confrontation with Senator Jeff Flake helped him to press the pause button.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Also, ahead, here in Britain, tempest flare over Brexit.  As my guest,  British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compares the European Union to the  Soviet Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, even the most powerful women maybe treated unfairly in the workplace.   Our Hari Srinivasan speaks Reddit co-founder and tech visionary, Alex  Ohanian.</p><p> Welcome the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p> The first Monday in October every year is the start of a new term for the  United State Supreme Court.  Republicans in Congress had hoped to see Brett  Kavanaugh long confirm by now and sitting on the bench.  But as they say,  even the best laid plans can go array.</p><p> After dramatic testimony from Kavanaugh and his accuser last week and an  even more dramatic display of people power against a key senator, the FBI  has now begun a limited investigation of accusations against Kavanaugh.</p><p> Here are the two sexual assault survivors, Ana Maria Archila and Maria  Gallagher confronting Republican Jeff Flake after he had said that he would  vote for Kavanaugh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANA MARIA ARCHILA:  What you are doing is allowing someone who actually  violated a woman to sit in the Supreme Court.  This is not tolerable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  And now, Flake has said this affect his decision to call for  more investigation.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  I just knew that we couldn't move forward,  that I couldn't move forward without hitting the pause button.  Because  what I was seeing, experiencing in an elevator and watching it in committee  and just thinking this is ripping our country apart.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> AMANPOUR:  As we've seen so| often this past year, a grassroots movement  powered by the personal stories of abuse survivor is having an impact at  the highest level.  So, is this actually a decisive moment now for the  #MeToo Movement?</p><p> My guest, Ana Marie Achila was one of the women who forced Senator Flake to  hear her own story on Friday and she's joining me from New York.  Also,  joining me Munich is Tarana Burke.  She founded the #MeToo Movement back in  2006.</p><p> Ladies, thank you both very, very much for joining me.  I cannot imagine  two better positioned people to take this discussion further as the FBI  investigation continues.</p><p> So, let me first ask you, Tarana Burke, since you have been pressing for  this kind of accountability ever since you founded the #MeToo Movement.  Do  you believe in your heart that this FBI investigation will deliver what you  all hope it will deliver?</p><p> TARANA BURKE, FOUNDER, #METOO MOVEMENT:  I can only hope it will deliver  it.  I don't know what the limitations that have been put on the  investigation if they can get an accurate -- come to an accurate conclusion  or deliver enough information to come to an accurate conclusion.</p><p> I'm glad that it was opened up but I wish it was given the proper amount of  time it deserves to really investigate a 36-year-old claim.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, just briefly before I turn to Ana Maria and her  intervention, what would you like to see happen given the circumstances?</p><p> BURKE:  Given the circumstances and the amount of detail that Dr. Blasey  ford gave in her testimony and even given the calendars and the things  Judge Kavanaugh have submitted, I love to see a thorough investigation  happen of all three claims that have been laid against Judge Kavanaugh, I  like to see it given the proper amount of time it deserves, meaning the FBI  dictates how long it takes for the investigation to take place, not given  week to turn it around so that they could -- so they could dig in and talk  to witnesses, talk to character witnesses, you know, really accumulate the  kind the information they need so that the Senate Judiciary Committee can  come to an accurate conclusion or more accurate.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, Ana Maria, you know, I think the whole world was transfixed  by that moment, in the elevator so to speak.  What made you -- just  describe for me and for the audience the process of knowing that Senator  Flake had said that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh, having been around  and watching these hearings and then just shoving your face in his?</p><p> ARCHILA:  So, I had been in Washington D.C. for days.  I had actually seen  Tarana a few days before, the day that I shared my story of -- as a  survivor for the first time in public, actually, in front Senator Flake's  office on Monday of that week.</p><p> And I was, I think, moved to do that by the courage of Dr. Blasey Ford, but  really by the road and the courage that Tarana has paid, the road that she  has picked for so many of us.  I went on Friday, the day of the Judiciary  Committee vote, early in the morning to gather with many of the people that  had been protesting the nomination of Kavanaugh.  And I met these young  women, Maria Gallagher, who was there for the first time.  She wanted to be  part of this moment, she wanted to -- she said at some point, \"I thought I  would show up and like hold the sign in the back of a rally,\" but she said  -- someone said, \"We should go to Senator Flake's office.\"  And I said,  \"Well, we have time.  There is half an hour before the hearing is about to  start, let's do it.\"</p><p> And we went together and kind of -- she was asking what -- how do I talk to  an elected official, I've never done this.  And we talked a little bit  about that experience.</p><p> As we were waiting for Senator Flake's office, not knowing if he was in  fact there, we saw the statement that he released, saying that he was ready  to support the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  And a minute  or two after, he walked out from his office and we were able to -- the  press that had gathered around him, followed him and we followed right  behind.  And we were -- what the world saw and what we experienced was a  total release of emotion that so many of us have been holding for weeks and  weeks as we've watched this nomination happen.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  And in your case -- </p><p> ARCHILA:  Pure outrage and pain.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  In your case, outrage and pain that you had been holding in for  years.  I mean, apparently, you said what had happened to you and your  parents didn't even know that.  Can you share with us what happened to you  in your sexual abuse?</p><p> ARCHILA:  I shared for the first-time last week that -- in public, I had  shared it with a few friends and with my mother when I was around 16 or so,  that I had been sexually abused as a child, as a five-year-old, by a young  man who was 15 at the time.</p><p> And I knew even as a five-year-old that that moment -- that -- if I shared  these with my parents, they would feel pain.  I didn't share it with them.   I was confused and ashamed and thought maybe it was my fault.  But it was  really my desire to not cause pain to my parents that motivated me to hold  that information.  And I think that's why -- it's one of the many reasons  why so many survivors choose not to share.  Because when you share, it's  not just painful for you, it's painful for the people who love you.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Tarana, you're listening to this unfold.  Of course, you  yourself were in the hearings when Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh  testified.  Just -- because you've been at this for so long and you founded  this movement back in 2006, I just want to know what you thought and how  you assess that moment when Ana Maria and Maria confronted Flake and -- but  it did actually cause him to push that pause button.</p><p> BURKE:  That moment was gripping.  I think there's no survivor of sexual  violence who could watch that without tears and without such a feeling, one  of pride.  And I just want to say thank you so much, while I have you here  in earshot for what the both of you did.  I was so brave and it was so  vulnerable.</p><p> And on the one hand watching it, my heart goes out to survivors who  continuously have to put ourselves on the line and put our stories out  there and be vulnerable in order for people to see us as fully human beings  and to see us as people who deserve to have -- to be believed and to be  heard and to be seen.</p><p> And so, in that part is painful.  But on the other hand, to know that it  stood for something, it meant something and that it -- there was an end  result that was what we were looking for.</p><p> So, you know, I see this happen so many times.  Sexual -- survivors of  sexual violence have to carry our burden around with us and we have to show  people evidence in our pain of how serious this issue is.  They don't make  other people do that, they don't make survivors of other crimes do that.   But survivors of sexual violence continuously have to carry this burden  around like it's ours to bear and it's not our burden to bear.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Well, let me just put this to you then, because in that  interview, a little of which we played from Jeff Flake and his colleague,  Senator Chris Coons, he was asked whether he thought Kavanaugh's opening  statement last week was partisan and political as certainly it had been  accused and been criticized for.</p><p> I want to play this because it speaks exactly to the point that you're just  making.  I get both of you to comment on it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHRIS COONS (D) DE.:  But, boy, I have to put myself in that spot and  you can understand why he was angry.  And, you know, I think gave a little  leeway there.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, the little at the top was he said it was partisan, but, boy,  you've got to understand him.  I mean, you know, Tarana, so what's changed?</p><p> ARCHILA:  I mean, I think that, you know, women -- </p><p> BURKE:  (INAUDIBLE) we have to understand him -- </p><p> AMANPOUR:  Go ahead.  Tarana first and then -- </p><p> ARCHILA:  No, no, no.  Go ahead, Tarana.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Yes.  Go ahead.</p><p> BURKE:  Yes.  I'm saying, to hear him say that we have to give him some  leeway and we have to understand why he's angry, what do you have to  understand for Dr. Blasey Ford?  When we -- when the world listened to her  describe in detail about being pushed in a room, pinned to a bed clothes  being tried -- having her clothed ripped at and her mouth covered to muffle  her screams and to carry that inside of her for 36 years, what do we give  her?</p><p> She can come to that hearing and be poise and fully present and not angry  and not, you know, overly emotional in ways that Kavanaugh was and then we  have to put up with him who is in an interview for the highest court of the  land, not being able control his emotions, would he allow anybody to come  in his courtroom and act the way he acted?  So, we have to give him some  leeway?  That is the epidemy of White male privilege.  He doesn't deserve  leeway because he's angry, because he has to stand in front of these  accusations.  I reject that notion.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  And, Ana Maria, I want to know what you think because, again,  you confronted Flake on this and that's why we have an FBI investigation  impart, in great part I would say.  But, you know, what do you make of the  fact that -- well, what do make of that soundbite we just played?</p><p> ARCHILA:  I agree completely with Tarana, that in many, the burden has been  placed on survivors to educate everyone else, including the abusers and the  victimizers, in this case, Kavanaugh.</p><p> And I think that we cannot continue to do that.  We cannot continue to drag  survivors through the experience of having to revive and relive some the  traumatic moments in order for someone else to benefit from our learning  and our experience.</p><p> And if we are going to do that, which is, in fact, what is happening in  this country and across the world, I would say, then we have to actually,  as a society, be willing to embrace the pain and use it to build something  new.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  OK.</p><p> ARCHILA:  I think so many survivors are bringing a new world into existence  -- </p><p> BURKE:  That's right.</p><p> ARCHILA:  --and we have to be able to receive it.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So that's what I was going to ask you next, because one of  Dianne Feinstein's comments, the ranking minority member on the Senate  Judiciary comment -- Committee was that, in the 27 years this is what she  said, \"Since Anita Hill, the Republicans, she said, had change their  strategy from blaming the victim to ignoring the victim.</p><p> But actually, in this case, the victim isn't being ignored because the ball  has been moved.  You've all done it.  You've succeeded in moving this ball.   There is a background investigation going on right now despite what you  consider as limitations.</p><p> So, Tarana, what does this mean for the #MeToo Movement?  Are we -- are  you, are we in a critical, critical moment right now?</p><p> BURKE:  We're definitely in a critical moment.  The one thing about this  hearing and this moment as it pertains to Judge Kavanaugh is that I think  that the shift that needed to happen around the #MeToo Movement and the  focus of it has finally happened and that shift is to focus on the  survivors.</p><p> We have a groundswell of survivor leadership happening right now, where  people around the country who are survivors of sexual violence and are  allies are pushing back, we're standing up, we're telling the country,  we're telling people to understand that we will not be silent and we won't  be shamed.</p><p> I think Dr. Blasey Ford represented a tipping point and it gave us the  opportunity to stand up for somebody who represented so many of us, and  that is going to change the trajectory of this movement in terms of how the  media frames it.  I hope, at least, it does.  That it is no longer framed  in reference to taking down powerful men but it's framed looking at the  survivors of sexual violence and what our needs are and when o demand are.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  You know, you just said about being framed in taking down  powerful men.  I do want to play this little bit of a speech that you gave  earlier this year at Varieties Power of Women Event.  It's about this and  then I'll ask you both to talk about it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURKE:  Even in these gloomy untenable political times, I still feel like  anything is possible.  That's why I'm so desperate to change the narrative  about the #MeToo Movement before it's too late.  Right now, the  conversation is mired in misconceptions.  Postings that this is about  naming and shaming, they think it's about taking down powerful men but  they're wrong.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, they're wrong.  So, what do you both think should actually  be the direction that women and men take this in going forward?  Let me  just you, Ana Maria, and then I'll ask Tarana.  Comment on what Tarana just  said in that clip.</p><p> ARCHILA:  I mean, I think that we are -- we have a tremendous opportunity  now that we're reckoning with the pain that is so shared by so many to  build a new thing.  I think that we cannot rely on an investigation by a  law enforcement agency to do that for us.  We have to seize this moment and  keep sharing our voices and being and leading the country.</p><p> I think the Supreme Court belongs to us, the FBI should not be deciding  that.  And it is by really transforming the pain into power and by changing  who tells the story and how we build a new culture that we move from these  dynamics where people understand these movements as shaming and blaming and  trying to take down men, when in reality what we're trying to do is build a  world where we can all live with dignity.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I want to ask you both, because as you now watch, there is a  pushback from many of the men or several of the men who have been accused  over this last year.  And some of the tone of that pushback is almost like,  Oh, woe is me.  Look how my life has been destroyed.</p><p> So, you can take John Hockenberry, you can take Jian Ghomeshi, you can take  Louis C.K. who came back to a standing ovation without mentioning his  issues, and Aziz Ansari.  So, let's just take those four.</p><p> Two questions.  One, how do you deal with that if there's not even a sort  of an acknowledgement in public?  Two, is there a spectrum that we should  be acknowledging and internalizing now that not every male, you know,  misconduct amounts to sexual assault, sexual abuse or anything in the  criminal range?</p><p> Tarana, you've been doing this for a long time.  What do you think about  this sliding scale, so to speak?</p><p> BURKE:  Well, I've said from the beginning, that sexual violence happens on  a spectrum and so, accountability has to happen on a spectrum.  And I  think, largely, if you talk to survivors of sexual violence, we 't don't  think punitively.  There's always a space for restoration.</p><p> I think the problem is and why you see such a visceral reaction from  survivors when these people come back into the spotlight without any  accountability, is that people -- that represents what we've always seen  and what we've experienced in our private lives, that people are allowed to  harm us and they don't have to account for that harm.</p><p> Accounting for that harm doesn't always look like going to jail or even  losing your job but there has to be some accountability.  If these men  would come back and start off with talking about what they learned in the  last year, what they've done in the last year to be restored, what they've  done to restore the survivor or the person who was victimized or the person  who was done wrong as a result of their behavior, then we can talk about  space for coming back.</p><p> The problem is that there is so much more conversation about how these men  come back than there is about how we make the survivors whole.  I think  it's deeply problematic that in the last year we can name a list of all 200  or however many men who have lost their jobs or lost positions, but how  many stories have we heard about what happened to the women?  How have  their lives been restored or destroyed?  How would they be made whole  again?  What are their needs?</p><p> We started off this year with #MeToo going viral.  An within 24 hours --  within 48 hours, we had multiple millions of people who engaged with the  hashtag via social media.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Well, I say -- </p><p> BURKE:  There would be no #MeToo Movement if those people did not stand up  to be accounted for, and yet we don't talk about them.  We continue to  pivot and talk about how do men come back or who the men are or how their  lives are affected, and that's the problem.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I think you're right.  It's a major sort of point of departure  right now to not just focus on, what you say, punitive in every case but  acknowledging and accountable and the rest of it.</p><p> But I also want to ask you, Ana Maria, you know, what hope do you have when  even the, you know, credible allegation of sexual abuse, sexual assault,  are now reduced to the level of a political football?  We've seen that  happen at this has played out, but we also see it in the polls where both  parties, men and women, have diametrically opposed views on this issue,  even people who watch the same film about a sexual encounter will have  different views on whether it was with consent or without consent, whether  it was abuse or whether it was, well, consensual?  How do you get past  that, Ana Maria?</p><p> ARCHILA:  You know what, I was trying -- one of the points that I was  trying to convey to Senator Flake in that elevator was that we have to have  a definition of justice that starts by recognizing harm, taking  responsibility, and only then beginning to repair it.</p><p> And I think everyone has to participate in the repair, including those who  did the harm.  That -- and this is a tremendous opportunity.  I so wish  that we could have a conversation about all of us have had the experience  of being harmed in some way, every single human being.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Let me -- </p><p> ARCHILA:  And all of us have had the experience of being hugged by the  person who yelled at us.  You know, we have experiences that allow us to  understand what these could look like.  And I think this is what we need to  be doing as a society.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, last work to you, Tarana, we got about 50 seconds left.   This is a world, not just a nation, a world where all the laws are made by  men.  I mean, this whole next wave clearly, I don't know whether you agree,  needs to redress that playing field.</p><p> BURKE:  Oh, yes.  We have opportunity particularly in the United States but  certainly around the world.  But we have an opportunity now to shift that.   I think that we -- that the world needs to be ready for survivors to emerge  as a constituency.  And that means that we are now people to just be  pitied, we are power base that vote along our needs and vote along the  things that we want to see change in policy.  And so, that means more women  being voted in, but not just women, who believe the same things we believe.   Women who are able to be -- to see us and hear us and believe us.</p><p> And so, whether it's a woman, a man or however they're identified in the  gender spectrum, we are poised to us our survivorship as a means of  galvanizing people to organize to get what we want to see in politics.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  It is a new day dawning.  We'll see how it ends up.  Tarana  Burke and Ana Maria Archila, thank you both so much for joining me.</p><p> So, over here, Britain is also in the midst of a bitter partisan warfare  but over Brexit.  The 2016 referendum to split from the rest of Europe.   Within Theresa May's own conservative party, it's dividing this country as  well and that government.  She is desperately trying to get a new trade  deal from President Trump.</p><p> Meanwhile, European leaders are warning that she cannot cherry-pick a new  deal with the E.U. and her own Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, added fuel  to the fire when he compared the E.U. to a Soviet Gulag holding Britain  prisoner.</p><p> I spoke with Hunt during the United Nations General Assembly in New York  last week, as his government pushed a post-Brexit free trade deal with the  Trump administration.  While also, at the same time, trying to pressure  that administration to save the Iran nuclear deal.  It's complicated to say  the least.</p><p> Foreign Secretary Hunt, welcome to the program.</p><p> JEREMY HUNT, FOREIGN SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  Thank you.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I want to know first and foremost, are you, the U.K., still  trying to save the Iran nuclear deal from President Trump's withdrawal?</p><p> HUNT:  Yes, we are.  We have lots of things with respect to Iran where we  totally agree with the administration.  We are very concerned about the  malign activity of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in places like Yemen,  Syria, (INAUDIBLE) activities and so on.</p><p> But we do believe that this agreement, which was originally signed with the  United States as a partner is the best way to prevent Iran re-nuclearizing.   And we are very concerned of the potential of a very, very serious conflict  in that part of the world if Iran does restart its nuclear ambitions.  And  that' why we are committed to it.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  It's not brain surgery, it does actually seem like if, as the  president says and you all say, including in the Security Council meeting,  that nonproliferation and keeping the worst most dangerous weapons out of  certain people's hand, it must be hard to imagine how you can ensure that  by pulling out of this deal.  What do you say to President Trump when you  try to persuade him diplomatically that what is the option?</p><p> HUNT:  Well, we have exactly the same destination as the U.S.  Now,  President Trump's view is the way to do that is to renegotiate, get a new  deal, a different deal to the nuclear deal.  We want to be very careful to  make sure that we don't throw the baby out with the bottle.</p><p> So, lots of people said President Trump was going to be an isolation as  president.  Far from it, he is very, very involved and he has, as we can  see, very strong views about how to get there.  What we want to do I to  make sure that as that situation evolves we don't see Iran restarting its  nuclear program.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, Federica Mogherini, the U.S. Foreign Policy Chief, said that  you all are trying to figure out other, as she put it, mechanism to enable  Iran to benefit from the economic pledges in return for its abiding by the  Iran nuclear deal.  And that if it doesn't feel like, and certainly the  Iranian president told me this week that they would have to pull out.   We're just going to play a quick soundbite, part of my interview with  Federica Mogherini on this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FEDERICA MOGHERINI, E.U. HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  We are  putting in place mechanisms together with the Europeans but also with the  Russians, with the Chinese, with others in the world, from all over the  world, to create the channels to keep trad within them that would guaranty  that trade can continue, regardless of the secondary sanctions that United  States have put.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  What kind of mechanisms could you all put in place to save the  economic part of this deal?  Because you're all pulling your own companies  out because of secondary sanction threats.</p><p> HUNT:  Well, it's very important not to characterize what European nations  are doing as being soft on Iran.  I sat in a meeting with Iranian Foreign  Minister Zarif this week at the U.N. General Assembly when country after  country that was a signatory to the Iran nuclear deal was being extremely  tough with the Iranians.  And they were saying, \"If you diverge from this  treaty in way at all, even the smallest way and you start your nuclear  ambitions again, then we're out of this deal.\"</p><p> And so, this is a very tough situation for Iran because they aren't getting  the full benefit of the deal that they were getting when the United States  was part of it.  But they're getting Europeans saying, you know, \"You so  much as blink on your commitments and we'll pull right out.\"</p><p> And so, that is what we're trying to do.  We're trying to make sure that in  a very difficult situation, the one thing we don't lose is a nonnuclear  Iran. </p><p> AMANPOUR:  Federica Mogherini specifically said that the United Kingdom and  others were trying to figure out almost a way around, like mechanism, she  said, that you or the Chinese, Russians, the others, could continue your  business obligations to Iran as long as it kept its obligations under the  nuclear deal.</p><p> Can you tell us what those mechanism might be?  How might you be able to  actually have your businesses working with Iran?</p><p> HUNT:  Well, as detail were going on into the precise nature of those  mechanisms.  But what I would say on the win-win issue is that, of course,  this is a deal and there has to be enough of a win for Iran to stop them at  restarting their nuclear program. But we don't want there to be so much of  a win that they are not deterred from the very malign activities that are  destabilizing the whole of that region.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  You once said about President Trump, you said, \"The traditional  Western Foreign-Policy has been that if we disapprove of something somebody  has done, we just don't take action but we stop the engagement as well.   Donald Trump takes a view that actually you need to engage with people.  I  think it's a business mentality.  He's always looking for a way to recast  the deal.\"</p><p> Do you still feel that way about Trump?  I mean, do you think there is  method to madness, as some people might describe?</p><p> HUNT:  I do think that he does look at the world in terms of the various  deals that America signed up to.  And rather than want to tear down the  firmament and abandon the whole international rural space system, he's  basically saying, \"Look, I accept the need for deals but they need to be  deals that work for America.\"</p><p> And I think if you look at, for example, his approach to the NATO summit  that we had this July, he arrived in a very competent mood because  actually, this is something we agree with him on, European allies are not  contributing as much as they should to the NATO budget.  The U.S. is  spending far more as a proportion its GDP.</p><p> He left the NATO summit a very happy, very committed to NATO because he had  secured some commitment for extra funding from the European side.  So I  think it's important to understand his methods which is the method to start  by making people sweat and think about the possibility of American  withdrawal.  But fundamentally, in the end, I think he does understand the  importance of some of the really important alliances that underpin the  international order.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I wonder what you make about his speech at the United Nations.   He was very clear that this was about a sovereign America.  And that he  rejected the idea as he said of globalism and embrace the idea of a  national doctrine of patriotism and he noted that on everybody.  As if  there were sort of mutually exclusive, you can't be patriotic if you are  globalist or whatever.</p><p> And, of course, Europe sovereignty is being breached if he says that he's  going to threaten you with secondary sanctions for doing business under an  internationally recognized deal.  So I just wonder how you can stand up for  yourself, how does Europe stand up for itself.  And perhaps even your  reaction to some of these books that have come out about his policy like  you talked about NATO.  His national security advisor came over and had all  this stuff signed up before the president who comes and have a different  view and maybe method ups so to speak.</p><p> HUNT:  Well, I think we have to understand the reasons why President Trump  is saying what he is saying.  And it's connected to the reasons why he was  elected which is that he has a base and we have similar possible place the  U.K. and Europe as well that feel disoriented and worried by globalization.   And that was probably something that was a contributor to the Brexit in the  U.K. and indeed to some of the political turbulence in other parts of  Europe.  And he's saying people need to know that their political leaders  are standing up for their country's interests and this isn't -- and their  identity isn't being compromised by some of the winds of change.</p><p> And so I think it is very important to recognize there is a role for  multinational institutions but also to recognize that they do need to be  reformed.  And the U.K. certainly stands with the U.S. on reform of the  U.N., reform of the WTO, reform of NATO.  These institutions have got to  work for the big players who operate within them and that was one of the  insights when the U.N. was set up with its rather -- with the structure of  the Security Council, the permanent members of vetoes that recognize the  difference between bigger countries and smaller countries.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Since you mentioned Brexit, I wanted to ask you to react.  I  mean I'm sure that when you come here, the majority of your counterparts  look at you still as if you put a gun to your head and, you know, embarked  on a journey to who knows where at this moment.  None of us know exactly  where it's going because there still isn't a deal.</p><p> But I wonder how you react to several recent developments.  In the latest  meeting with the E.U., Donald Tusk famously offered promise to Mason Cakes  and then tweeted that there won't be any cherries, no cherry picking.  And  then President Macron went even further and he was actually very blunt  about the Brexiters and the policies that he said they had sold to the  voters.  This is what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  The Brexit teaches  us something -- and I completely respect British sovereignty when I say  that.  It showed that those who say that we can easily leave without  Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it's going to  bring in a lot of money are liars.  And it is even more true since they  left the day after so they wouldn't have to deal with it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I mean he has a point, right?  There are a lot of things that  Brexit promised, the Brexiters promised, that are just pie in the sky.</p><p> HUNT:  I think the first thing to say is that we need some perspective  here.  It's a very big decision when a country decides to leave an  organization like the European Union that was always going to be a very  difficult negotiation.  We're coming to the crunch periods now and what I  see behind the scenes is that there is a tremendous desire on both sides to  actually come to an agreement because not coming to an agreement will be  damaging all around.  And so that is the first point to make.  But I think  some of those comments are really based on a misunderstanding of why the  British people voted for Brexit.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  But you did say -- you used to be health secretary and you did  say some of the Brexit slogans were lies and even your side says that 350  million whatever it was pounds or euros to the NHS was not true and not a  deliverable promise.</p><p> HUNT:  Well, we're a democracy.  And when you have a referendum campaign,  just like when you have an election campaign, there are lots of claims made  on both sides.  In the case of the funding for the NHS, there were lots of  voices saying that's not the whole picture.  And people listened to those  voices and they made their decision and that's what happens in a democracy.</p><p> But the most important thing is this was not a decision by the British  people to reject Europe, to be un-European to be anti-European.  We have a  country that just shed more blood in Europe, has sacrificed more than  perhaps anyone else for peace, prosperity, and stability in Europe but we  do want our sovereignty back.  We want a different legal relationship but  we want to carry on the friendship with European partners and colleagues.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Do you think the Prime Minister's seen off a leadership  challenge for now?</p><p> HUNT:  She is very secure.  I mean, of course, newspapers will write the  articles they want to write.  But people understand that she's someone of  enormous tenacity resilience.  She's had a very very difficult few years  with the Brexit situation but she has brought us forward and she's brought  us to the point where a deal is possible and now we just need to see it  through.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  One of the issues on your agenda, you've been tweeting about it,  is some of the British citizens who are held by Iran.  For instance,  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.  You've again said that you've been talking  about it.  Prime Minister May said that she spoke to the president of Iran  about it.  I asked the president of Iran yesterday, this is what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator):  Well, I'm not  aware of the details of any detainees' files but I have heard that new  charges were brought against her and the judiciary was awaiting the  response from the defense.  So these are actions that are taking place in  the judiciary.</p><p> But if efforts of foreign governments can be beneficial with this -- for  example, when we talk about our citizens being imprisoned in other  countries, in Western countries, when we talk about those to the government  officials, they tell us, \"Well, there's not much we can do because they're  under the guise of the judiciary in our country.\"  So we must all bring a  constant concerted effort to their house so that all prisoners must be  free, they're returned to their families but it must be a path that travels  both ways.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  That's their view.  What is your hope?  And have you made any  progress with trying to make sure that this British citizen who's done  nothing wrong as a civilian gets released and was going to get out?  We  thought last Christmas she was going to come out.</p><p> HUNT:  It is not acceptable for Iran -- by the way, it isn't just Nazanin  Zaghari-Ratcliffe.  There are others as well in the same situation.  We  don't mention names and the families are happy with that.  But it is not  acceptable to detain innocent people as a tool of diplomatic leverage.  And  that is what is happening and it's just not acceptable.  And I made that  very clear to her Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif.</p><p> We need this situation to be resolved.  We need these people to be able to  come home.  And Britain is not a country that is just going to stand by and  allow this kind of injustice to continue so we need to see progress.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  You're still tweeting about your gas, your faux pas, about your  wife.  You said that she was Japanese instead of Chinese and you just said  it -- you tweeted humorously about it in Japan.  Are you going to limit  down?</p><p> HUNT:  I don't know.  Certainly great to have a discussion within the  hundred (ph) family.  The truth is -- I'm not sure I've said this on  broadcast before but I speak Japanese and I spoke -- the last time I met  the Chinese foreign minister, we've spoken in Japanese and that's --</p><p> AMANPOUR:  With the Chinese foreign minister?</p><p> HUNT:  With the Chinese foreign minister because he used to be the  ambassador in Tokyo.  And so I was just muddling up my small talk but  luckily I have a wife who has a great sense of humor.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Luckily.  Foreign Secretary, thank you very much indeed.</p><p> HUNT:  Thank you.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Sense of humor is vitally important at all times.</p><p> Turning now to one of the most successful investors in big tech and  innovation Alexis Ohanian, a self-made millionaire.  He started making  waves as the co-founder of the social media platform Reddit, one of the  most visited websites in the United States.  And most recently, with his  venture capital firm Initialized Capital which makes early bets on startups  like the grocery delivery service into the cart and the cryptocurrency  exchange platform Coinbase.</p><p> But his celebrity status soared after marrying tennis champ Serena Williams  last year, three months after welcoming their baby daughter Olympia.   Alexis recently sat down with our Hari Sreenivasan for a masterclass in  business and parenthood.</p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN, CONTRIBUTOR:  All right.  First, let's talk about the big  money part of it.  Initialized Capital.  You look at your website.  You've  got 125 plus companies.  So how do you figure, out of your 120 plus bets,  how many of them need to become super successful?</p><p> ALEXIS OHANIAN:  Yes.  I mean there are, you know, for every one Coinbase  or Instacart, there are 20, 30, 40 that won't survive.  And that's the math  that at this kind of early stage of investing actually still works.  It  really is a power law where the returns from these one or two big bets that  are successful makeup for all the others that aren't.  The upside of that  is it lets us be a little bit more aggressive and be able to take sort of  bigger bets or bolder bets on ideas that are a little further out there.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  You've also made a bet in the driverless car space.</p><p> OHANIAN:  Yes.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  That's been on Cruise.  That would be a partner that was  acquired by G.M.</p><p> OHANIAN:  That's right.  So we grew the first investors in Cruise.  It was  just -- at that point, it was basically a research project because no  startup back in 2012 really thought that they could compete with the likes  of Google or Uber, these others.  And then we went back a second time  actually, invested in another self-driving car company called Voyage.</p><p> Their approach is a little different.  What they found was an opportunity  where they're able to get their cars on the roads today by using retirement  communities.  These are large swaths of land that have many many miles of  roads that look and train the computers just like any other road.  It's  contained, it's private land, and so they can work with these retirement  communities and offer an amazing service to people who are otherwise pretty  limited in mobility, right.</p><p> The idea that your grandparents can have a self-driving taxi service to  help take them to the store, gives them mobility and freedom they didn't  have before.  And in fact, the cars only go like 25 miles an hour is  actually a feature.  That's actually probably how fast most of those cars  would be going if the elderly were behind the wheel anyway.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Right.</p><p> OHANIAN:  And it's finding a way to use this technology that is practical  and valuable and safe but also collecting data now in real time regularly  on real roads.  And I think long term, that's where the value is going to  be.  These cars will get smarter the more hours they spend on the roads  because these cameras, this AI is constantly learning and absorbing and  improving.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Let's talk a little bit about the content struggles a lot of  these platforms are having to deal with right now.  I mean the kind of the  enforce (ph) conundrum.  The president recently weighed in and he is  warning people about the power of the platforms, their political influence,  they don't like me in the first place.  But is their concern that they are  so powerful now that they are players in the political process?</p><p> OHANIAN:  So interesting because now it's coming -- so it's coming from the  left and the right.  I think these platforms are trying very very hard to  maintain a neutrality and -- </p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Is that possible?</p><p> OHANIAN:  -- the reality is -- ultimately I don't think that's possible.  I  think with Google, Facebook and these others haven't done so well though is  entrenched themselves in our lives in such a fundamental way for so long  that I do believe -- I mean part of what we do is look for an early stage  investor who wants to do something as audacious as topple Google or topple  Facebook one day or build a competitor to them.  But admittedly, the impact  that they've been able to have and build up is wide-reaching and it affects  many many parts of our life.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Reddit in a way has become, as you guys call it, the front  page of the Internet, right.  But beyond the front page, behind it, there  are also places where you find incredibly distasteful speech.  I mean you  can find it on forums that support the president right now, really racist  memes that would attack you for being Armenian or your wife for being  African-American, right.  I mean so what is -- how do you solve for that?</p><p> OHANIAN:  Well, it is reprehensible.  And I do remember, this was many  years ago, the first time I had an Armenian genocide denial posed at me.   On the one hand, I thought, \"OK.  Well, you know, this is despicable and  obviously, I hate it.\"  And at the same time, I thought, \"OK.  Well, I  guess like we're at a scale now where this is a real -- this is the  reality.  We're now a global enough platform that we're seeing these  worldviews that are so awful and so offensive.\"</p><p> The solution for how do we fix it is a bigger -- this is a bigger global  one I think.  I do think that through more exposure and through more  communication, we do get to more empathy and understanding.  Through more  conversation, we get there and I've seen it in glimpses on Reddit.  I've  seen and I do believe that long-term, sunlight and truth wins.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  But that's a really long term.  I mean very long.   Theologically, irrational people who hold despicable points of view are not  often convinced by facts.  They're not convinced by --</p><p> OHANIAN:  We have a flat earth theory going around right now that's picking  up steam.  Like a flat earth theory in 2018.  You know I remember reading  about The Enlightenment.  And I think when I was -- I think when I was  studying it in history, I just sort of assumed that like there was this  enlightenment.  And then after that, like everyone was like cool, rational  thought, scientific method.  Like, great world's fixed, it started, it's  done.  And I pretty -- I guess I really naively sort of thought that.</p><p> And this is surfacing now, this reality that like no actually there are a  lot of people for whom this -- like just sort of miss or who even today  just don't care, and would rather see things that reinforce their world.   Like explicitly, would rather see things that reinforce their worldview  than challenge it with data.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Is there a rule for regulation then?</p><p> OHANIAN:  I can imagine that coming from this president given his history  of being very anti-regulation.  I think there is still -- I mean I think  there is still real competition.  I do -- I mean actually we have -- one of  our big thesis is around the like anti-Amazon thesis where because of  Amazon's place in the market, when they decide to go into something, it  creates an amazing opportunity for startups to basically arm their  opponents.</p><p> And so we saw this most recently with comical standard cognition which does  self-checkout.  When Amazon launched, it was Amazon Go to Self-Checkout  Store, just pick up the peanuts and walk out.  Every retailer realized, \"Oh  no.  I'm going to bring more.  I don't have this work.  What do I do?\"   Exactly.</p><p> And because they know they can't build it themselves, they come to a  startup like Standard Cognition and then started with customers.  So I do  see that actually serving as a tremendous boon for competition.  But the  reality is the incumbents themselves have neglected technology so much,  they can't build it themselves.  They can't go to their CTO and say, \"OK.   We need a solution in eight months.\"  Just the engineering talent isn't  there.  There's just -- they're unable to build it.  They have to partner  with these startups.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Let's talk a little bit about your much longer-term  investments.</p><p> OHANIAN:  My family.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Yes.  So you're married to Serena Williams.  Is she as  competitive off the court as she is on the court?</p><p> OHANIAN:  Yes.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Have you ever beat her on anything?</p><p> OHANIAN:  Oh, yes.  It's just -- I mean there's a few video games.   Actually, there's a few that she'll still -- she'll wash me in the  classics, the classic NES games she's better at but it's less about  competition with someone else.  It's more about her own -- almost like a  competition with herself.  She is one of the sort of hardest people on  themselves who I know and that's what makes her great.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  And a humbling experience?  I mean you said at one point that  you thought you worked hard.</p><p> OHANIAN:  Oh, yes.  I thought I worked so hard.  Tech is full of these  myths around, you know, nonstop working in the grind, in the hassle and all  this stuff and I really believed I was like, \"OK.  Well, I'm in the hardest  working industry.  They're working all the time.  Your doors never close.   It's 24/7 Internet blah blah blah.\"  And yes, I was so wrong, very very  wrong.</p><p> I think what I didn't really appreciate, what I didn't really understand  until I saw it first hand was what a pressure it is and what an intensity  it is to do your job in front of so many people, but there is so much on  you when you are out there.  I used to hate tennis.  I thought tennis was a  boring sport.  I would change the channel.  It was -- I was so wrong.  And  to see what she's been able to do at the level she's done it in a sport  where it's just you, it's just you out there, is just amazing.  It's  absolutely amazing.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  One of the things that she did which was surprising and  startling to a lot of people was she was very open about going through  postpartum depression.  It's just not something that a lot of women share,  much less women of her fame and fortune so to speak.  But it's also not  something that men talk about.</p><p> OHANIAN:  I mean, look, as a husband, I just want to be there.  I want to  be the rock.  I want to be supportive.  And it is already so much to carry  a child, to have a child, to do all of that.  Not to mention all the  complications that she had to go through and endure.  Yes.  I mean I was so  -- I was very proud of her for speaking about it publicly.</p><p> She realizes the platform she has in the world.  And I think what's so  special is she's always been very unfiltered.  And when you combine her  level of success with this unfiltered nature, I think there's a hunger for  this realness because there's a lot that isn't that --</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  That so much is just polished and part of the presentations  of the vacation that you had and whatever but --</p><p> OHANIAN:  Our Instagram culture.  And look, I'm guilty of it too.  Like it  is the rose-tinted sort of best version of yourself that you want to  present to the world.  And I think that's fine and that's something we as  humans want but that creates a hunger for that real talk.  And, you know,  I've had so many people just randomly come up to me, and mothers in  particular, just walking down the street now who will thank me for -- and  I'm like why are you thanking me, it's just sent along to your wife because  of what she said and what she's talked about and how much it means to them.   And I'm happy, very happy, to deliver that thanks.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  You got a one-year-old, what is she teaching you?</p><p> OHANIAN:  That everything I've done up until this point, not that cool, not  that great.  As proud as I was of all the things I've done in my career, I  just -- I look at that little baby and I'm just like this is my legacy.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Recently, an associate on Instagram criticized you for taking  what he called family vacation and response resonated with a lot of  parents.</p><p> OHANIAN:  Yes.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  Was the vacation wild?</p><p> OHANIAN:  That was wild.  It's like a week with my fam and yes.  An  associate in another V.C. firm had made some note about being -- implying  that I wasn't working hard.  And I was on vacation but I think this kind of  goes back to that the same notion that tech has in our little bubble that  we are this -- we have to be this hardest working 24/7, got to grind  mentality which is just -- it's not true but it's also dangerous.</p><p> I worry because there is so much, especially in masculinity tied up in the  grind and the hassle and work, and especially when it comes to family where  there had been a huge proponent for paid family leave because I want men to  be taking time off.  I want women to be able to take time off.</p><p> I mean right now we have, I think one in four American women, are back at  work two weeks later after having a kid.  I think that's insane.  To be the  last developed country to not have any kind of policy is insane.  And I've  spoken about it.  I took four months leave.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  And you're fortunate to be able to do that.</p><p> OHANIAN:  And I was very lucky to do that.  And that is something I will  give the tech industry credit for.  It is a pretty standard thing to have  generous parental leave policies intact and I hope it can be a standard for  other industries but I want it to be a standard for the country.  And if  there is that policy in place, taking advantage of it is another level  because so many men still don't.</p><p> And this provides a sort of double advantage because one, it means men get  to spend time with their families during these early days which are really  important.  But it also gives more air cover to women in the organization  to take time off and help to start to change a lot of those cultural and  systemic problems that exist in tech and in business around women in the  workforce.  And so I was proud to take all my time off.  And I'm happy to  be speaking out about it because it is very hard to try and balance it all.</p><p> And actually, for the first time, it was like a month ago at the  Commonwealth Club, actually got asked the question my wife's been asked  plenty of times which was how do you balance at all work and family.  And I  was happy to be asked it because I hadn't gotten asked it and I know she  gets asked it in so many working women, moms who get asked it all the time.   And I would like us all to get asked that enough that we just never - it  never even becomes an issue anymore, it just becomes a question.</p><p> SREENIVASAN:  All right.  Alexis Ohanian, thanks for joining us.</p><p> OHANIAN:  Thank you.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Now, in the wake of Serena's very public outburst at the U.S.  Open Final over a dispute with the umpire, Ohanian dismissed the New York  Times article that claimed men are more penalized than women in tennis  saying it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges.</p><p> That is it for our program.

What happens when the irresistible force of the #MeToo Movement runs into the immovable object of partisan politics. I speak to #MeToo founder, Tarana Burke, and to Ana Maria Archila, whose confrontation with Senator Jeff Flake helped him to press the pause button.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, ahead, here in Britain, tempest flare over Brexit. As my guest, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compares the European Union to the Soviet Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, even the most powerful women maybe treated unfairly in the workplace. Our Hari Srinivasan speaks Reddit co-founder and tech visionary, Alex Ohanian.</p><p>Welcome the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>The first Monday in October every year is the start of a new term for the United State Supreme Court. Republicans in Congress had hoped to see Brett Kavanaugh long confirm by now and sitting on the bench. But as they say, even the best laid plans can go array.</p><p>After dramatic testimony from Kavanaugh and his accuser last week and an even more dramatic display of people power against a key senator, the FBI has now begun a limited investigation of accusations against Kavanaugh.</p><p>Here are the two sexual assault survivors, Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher confronting Republican Jeff Flake after he had said that he would vote for Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANA MARIA ARCHILA: What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit in the Supreme Court. This is not tolerable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And now, Flake has said this affect his decision to call for more investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: I just knew that we couldn't move forward, that I couldn't move forward without hitting the pause button. Because what I was seeing, experiencing in an elevator and watching it in committee and just thinking this is ripping our country apart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: As we've seen so| often this past year, a grassroots movement powered by the personal stories of abuse survivor is having an impact at the highest level. So, is this actually a decisive moment now for the #MeToo Movement?</p><p>My guest, Ana Marie Achila was one of the women who forced Senator Flake to hear her own story on Friday and she's joining me from New York. Also, joining me Munich is Tarana Burke. She founded the #MeToo Movement back in 2006.</p><p>Ladies, thank you both very, very much for joining me. I cannot imagine two better positioned people to take this discussion further as the FBI investigation continues.</p><p>So, let me first ask you, Tarana Burke, since you have been pressing for this kind of accountability ever since you founded the #MeToo Movement. Do you believe in your heart that this FBI investigation will deliver what you all hope it will deliver?</p><p>TARANA BURKE, FOUNDER, #METOO MOVEMENT: I can only hope it will deliver it. I don't know what the limitations that have been put on the investigation if they can get an accurate -- come to an accurate conclusion or deliver enough information to come to an accurate conclusion.</p><p>I'm glad that it was opened up but I wish it was given the proper amount of time it deserves to really investigate a 36-year-old claim.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, just briefly before I turn to Ana Maria and her intervention, what would you like to see happen given the circumstances?</p><p>BURKE: Given the circumstances and the amount of detail that Dr. Blasey ford gave in her testimony and even given the calendars and the things Judge Kavanaugh have submitted, I love to see a thorough investigation happen of all three claims that have been laid against Judge Kavanaugh, I like to see it given the proper amount of time it deserves, meaning the FBI dictates how long it takes for the investigation to take place, not given week to turn it around so that they could -- so they could dig in and talk to witnesses, talk to character witnesses, you know, really accumulate the kind the information they need so that the Senate Judiciary Committee can come to an accurate conclusion or more accurate.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Ana Maria, you know, I think the whole world was transfixed by that moment, in the elevator so to speak. What made you -- just describe for me and for the audience the process of knowing that Senator Flake had said that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh, having been around and watching these hearings and then just shoving your face in his?</p><p>ARCHILA: So, I had been in Washington D.C. for days. I had actually seen Tarana a few days before, the day that I shared my story of -- as a survivor for the first time in public, actually, in front Senator Flake's office on Monday of that week.</p><p>And I was, I think, moved to do that by the courage of Dr. Blasey Ford, but really by the road and the courage that Tarana has paid, the road that she has picked for so many of us. I went on Friday, the day of the Judiciary Committee vote, early in the morning to gather with many of the people that had been protesting the nomination of Kavanaugh. And I met these young women, Maria Gallagher, who was there for the first time. She wanted to be part of this moment, she wanted to -- she said at some point, \"I thought I would show up and like hold the sign in the back of a rally,\" but she said -- someone said, \"We should go to Senator Flake's office.\" And I said, \"Well, we have time. There is half an hour before the hearing is about to start, let's do it.\"</p><p>And we went together and kind of -- she was asking what -- how do I talk to an elected official, I've never done this. And we talked a little bit about that experience.</p><p>As we were waiting for Senator Flake's office, not knowing if he was in fact there, we saw the statement that he released, saying that he was ready to support the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. And a minute or two after, he walked out from his office and we were able to -- the press that had gathered around him, followed him and we followed right behind. And we were -- what the world saw and what we experienced was a total release of emotion that so many of us have been holding for weeks and weeks as we've watched this nomination happen.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And in your case --</p><p>ARCHILA: Pure outrage and pain.</p><p>AMANPOUR: In your case, outrage and pain that you had been holding in for years. I mean, apparently, you said what had happened to you and your parents didn't even know that. Can you share with us what happened to you in your sexual abuse?</p><p>ARCHILA: I shared for the first-time last week that -- in public, I had shared it with a few friends and with my mother when I was around 16 or so, that I had been sexually abused as a child, as a five-year-old, by a young man who was 15 at the time.</p><p>And I knew even as a five-year-old that that moment -- that -- if I shared these with my parents, they would feel pain. I didn't share it with them. I was confused and ashamed and thought maybe it was my fault. But it was really my desire to not cause pain to my parents that motivated me to hold that information. And I think that's why -- it's one of the many reasons why so many survivors choose not to share. Because when you share, it's not just painful for you, it's painful for the people who love you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Tarana, you're listening to this unfold. Of course, you yourself were in the hearings when Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh testified. Just -- because you've been at this for so long and you founded this movement back in 2006, I just want to know what you thought and how you assess that moment when Ana Maria and Maria confronted Flake and -- but it did actually cause him to push that pause button.</p><p>BURKE: That moment was gripping. I think there's no survivor of sexual violence who could watch that without tears and without such a feeling, one of pride. And I just want to say thank you so much, while I have you here in earshot for what the both of you did. I was so brave and it was so vulnerable.</p><p>And on the one hand watching it, my heart goes out to survivors who continuously have to put ourselves on the line and put our stories out there and be vulnerable in order for people to see us as fully human beings and to see us as people who deserve to have -- to be believed and to be heard and to be seen.</p><p>And so, in that part is painful. But on the other hand, to know that it stood for something, it meant something and that it -- there was an end result that was what we were looking for.</p><p>So, you know, I see this happen so many times. Sexual -- survivors of sexual violence have to carry our burden around with us and we have to show people evidence in our pain of how serious this issue is. They don't make other people do that, they don't make survivors of other crimes do that. But survivors of sexual violence continuously have to carry this burden around like it's ours to bear and it's not our burden to bear.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, let me just put this to you then, because in that interview, a little of which we played from Jeff Flake and his colleague, Senator Chris Coons, he was asked whether he thought Kavanaugh's opening statement last week was partisan and political as certainly it had been accused and been criticized for.</p><p>I want to play this because it speaks exactly to the point that you're just making. I get both of you to comment on it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D) DE.: But, boy, I have to put myself in that spot and you can understand why he was angry. And, you know, I think gave a little leeway there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, the little at the top was he said it was partisan, but, boy, you've got to understand him. I mean, you know, Tarana, so what's changed?</p><p>ARCHILA: I mean, I think that, you know, women --</p><p>BURKE: (INAUDIBLE) we have to understand him --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Go ahead. Tarana first and then --</p><p>ARCHILA: No, no, no. Go ahead, Tarana.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. Go ahead.</p><p>BURKE: Yes. I'm saying, to hear him say that we have to give him some leeway and we have to understand why he's angry, what do you have to understand for Dr. Blasey Ford? When we -- when the world listened to her describe in detail about being pushed in a room, pinned to a bed clothes being tried -- having her clothed ripped at and her mouth covered to muffle her screams and to carry that inside of her for 36 years, what do we give her?</p><p>She can come to that hearing and be poise and fully present and not angry and not, you know, overly emotional in ways that Kavanaugh was and then we have to put up with him who is in an interview for the highest court of the land, not being able control his emotions, would he allow anybody to come in his courtroom and act the way he acted? So, we have to give him some leeway? That is the epidemy of White male privilege. He doesn't deserve leeway because he's angry, because he has to stand in front of these accusations. I reject that notion.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And, Ana Maria, I want to know what you think because, again, you confronted Flake on this and that's why we have an FBI investigation impart, in great part I would say. But, you know, what do you make of the fact that -- well, what do make of that soundbite we just played?</p><p>ARCHILA: I agree completely with Tarana, that in many, the burden has been placed on survivors to educate everyone else, including the abusers and the victimizers, in this case, Kavanaugh.</p><p>And I think that we cannot continue to do that. We cannot continue to drag survivors through the experience of having to revive and relive some the traumatic moments in order for someone else to benefit from our learning and our experience.</p><p>And if we are going to do that, which is, in fact, what is happening in this country and across the world, I would say, then we have to actually, as a society, be willing to embrace the pain and use it to build something new.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>ARCHILA: I think so many survivors are bringing a new world into existence --</p><p>BURKE: That's right.</p><p>ARCHILA: --and we have to be able to receive it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So that's what I was going to ask you next, because one of Dianne Feinstein's comments, the ranking minority member on the Senate Judiciary comment -- Committee was that, in the 27 years this is what she said, \"Since Anita Hill, the Republicans, she said, had change their strategy from blaming the victim to ignoring the victim.</p><p>But actually, in this case, the victim isn't being ignored because the ball has been moved. You've all done it. You've succeeded in moving this ball. There is a background investigation going on right now despite what you consider as limitations.</p><p>So, Tarana, what does this mean for the #MeToo Movement? Are we -- are you, are we in a critical, critical moment right now?</p><p>BURKE: We're definitely in a critical moment. The one thing about this hearing and this moment as it pertains to Judge Kavanaugh is that I think that the shift that needed to happen around the #MeToo Movement and the focus of it has finally happened and that shift is to focus on the survivors.</p><p>We have a groundswell of survivor leadership happening right now, where people around the country who are survivors of sexual violence and are allies are pushing back, we're standing up, we're telling the country, we're telling people to understand that we will not be silent and we won't be shamed.</p><p>I think Dr. Blasey Ford represented a tipping point and it gave us the opportunity to stand up for somebody who represented so many of us, and that is going to change the trajectory of this movement in terms of how the media frames it. I hope, at least, it does. That it is no longer framed in reference to taking down powerful men but it's framed looking at the survivors of sexual violence and what our needs are and when o demand are.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, you just said about being framed in taking down powerful men. I do want to play this little bit of a speech that you gave earlier this year at Varieties Power of Women Event. It's about this and then I'll ask you both to talk about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Even in these gloomy untenable political times, I still feel like anything is possible. That's why I'm so desperate to change the narrative about the #MeToo Movement before it's too late. Right now, the conversation is mired in misconceptions. Postings that this is about naming and shaming, they think it's about taking down powerful men but they're wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, they're wrong. So, what do you both think should actually be the direction that women and men take this in going forward? Let me just you, Ana Maria, and then I'll ask Tarana. Comment on what Tarana just said in that clip.</p><p>ARCHILA: I mean, I think that we are -- we have a tremendous opportunity now that we're reckoning with the pain that is so shared by so many to build a new thing. I think that we cannot rely on an investigation by a law enforcement agency to do that for us. We have to seize this moment and keep sharing our voices and being and leading the country.</p><p>I think the Supreme Court belongs to us, the FBI should not be deciding that. And it is by really transforming the pain into power and by changing who tells the story and how we build a new culture that we move from these dynamics where people understand these movements as shaming and blaming and trying to take down men, when in reality what we're trying to do is build a world where we can all live with dignity.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to ask you both, because as you now watch, there is a pushback from many of the men or several of the men who have been accused over this last year. And some of the tone of that pushback is almost like, Oh, woe is me. Look how my life has been destroyed.</p><p>So, you can take John Hockenberry, you can take Jian Ghomeshi, you can take Louis C.K. who came back to a standing ovation without mentioning his issues, and Aziz Ansari. So, let's just take those four.</p><p>Two questions. One, how do you deal with that if there's not even a sort of an acknowledgement in public? Two, is there a spectrum that we should be acknowledging and internalizing now that not every male, you know, misconduct amounts to sexual assault, sexual abuse or anything in the criminal range?</p><p>Tarana, you've been doing this for a long time. What do you think about this sliding scale, so to speak?</p><p>BURKE: Well, I've said from the beginning, that sexual violence happens on a spectrum and so, accountability has to happen on a spectrum. And I think, largely, if you talk to survivors of sexual violence, we 't don't think punitively. There's always a space for restoration.</p><p>I think the problem is and why you see such a visceral reaction from survivors when these people come back into the spotlight without any accountability, is that people -- that represents what we've always seen and what we've experienced in our private lives, that people are allowed to harm us and they don't have to account for that harm.</p><p>Accounting for that harm doesn't always look like going to jail or even losing your job but there has to be some accountability. If these men would come back and start off with talking about what they learned in the last year, what they've done in the last year to be restored, what they've done to restore the survivor or the person who was victimized or the person who was done wrong as a result of their behavior, then we can talk about space for coming back.</p><p>The problem is that there is so much more conversation about how these men come back than there is about how we make the survivors whole. I think it's deeply problematic that in the last year we can name a list of all 200 or however many men who have lost their jobs or lost positions, but how many stories have we heard about what happened to the women? How have their lives been restored or destroyed? How would they be made whole again? What are their needs?</p><p>We started off this year with #MeToo going viral. An within 24 hours -- within 48 hours, we had multiple millions of people who engaged with the hashtag via social media.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I say --</p><p>BURKE: There would be no #MeToo Movement if those people did not stand up to be accounted for, and yet we don't talk about them. We continue to pivot and talk about how do men come back or who the men are or how their lives are affected, and that's the problem.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I think you're right. It's a major sort of point of departure right now to not just focus on, what you say, punitive in every case but acknowledging and accountable and the rest of it.</p><p>But I also want to ask you, Ana Maria, you know, what hope do you have when even the, you know, credible allegation of sexual abuse, sexual assault, are now reduced to the level of a political football? We've seen that happen at this has played out, but we also see it in the polls where both parties, men and women, have diametrically opposed views on this issue, even people who watch the same film about a sexual encounter will have different views on whether it was with consent or without consent, whether it was abuse or whether it was, well, consensual? How do you get past that, Ana Maria?</p><p>ARCHILA: You know what, I was trying -- one of the points that I was trying to convey to Senator Flake in that elevator was that we have to have a definition of justice that starts by recognizing harm, taking responsibility, and only then beginning to repair it.</p><p>And I think everyone has to participate in the repair, including those who did the harm. That -- and this is a tremendous opportunity. I so wish that we could have a conversation about all of us have had the experience of being harmed in some way, every single human being.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me --</p><p>ARCHILA: And all of us have had the experience of being hugged by the person who yelled at us. You know, we have experiences that allow us to understand what these could look like. And I think this is what we need to be doing as a society.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, last work to you, Tarana, we got about 50 seconds left. This is a world, not just a nation, a world where all the laws are made by men. I mean, this whole next wave clearly, I don't know whether you agree, needs to redress that playing field.</p><p>BURKE: Oh, yes. We have opportunity particularly in the United States but certainly around the world. But we have an opportunity now to shift that. I think that we -- that the world needs to be ready for survivors to emerge as a constituency. And that means that we are now people to just be pitied, we are power base that vote along our needs and vote along the things that we want to see change in policy. And so, that means more women being voted in, but not just women, who believe the same things we believe. Women who are able to be -- to see us and hear us and believe us.</p><p>And so, whether it's a woman, a man or however they're identified in the gender spectrum, we are poised to us our survivorship as a means of galvanizing people to organize to get what we want to see in politics.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It is a new day dawning. We'll see how it ends up. Tarana Burke and Ana Maria Archila, thank you both so much for joining me.</p><p>So, over here, Britain is also in the midst of a bitter partisan warfare but over Brexit. The 2016 referendum to split from the rest of Europe. Within Theresa May's own conservative party, it's dividing this country as well and that government. She is desperately trying to get a new trade deal from President Trump.</p><p>Meanwhile, European leaders are warning that she cannot cherry-pick a new deal with the E.U. and her own Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, added fuel to the fire when he compared the E.U. to a Soviet Gulag holding Britain prisoner.</p><p>I spoke with Hunt during the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week, as his government pushed a post-Brexit free trade deal with the Trump administration. While also, at the same time, trying to pressure that administration to save the Iran nuclear deal. It's complicated to say the least.</p><p>Foreign Secretary Hunt, welcome to the program.</p><p>JEREMY HUNT, FOREIGN SECRETARY, BRITAIN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to know first and foremost, are you, the U.K., still trying to save the Iran nuclear deal from President Trump's withdrawal?</p><p>HUNT: Yes, we are. We have lots of things with respect to Iran where we totally agree with the administration. We are very concerned about the malign activity of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in places like Yemen, Syria, (INAUDIBLE) activities and so on.</p><p>But we do believe that this agreement, which was originally signed with the United States as a partner is the best way to prevent Iran re-nuclearizing. And we are very concerned of the potential of a very, very serious conflict in that part of the world if Iran does restart its nuclear ambitions. And that' why we are committed to it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's not brain surgery, it does actually seem like if, as the president says and you all say, including in the Security Council meeting, that nonproliferation and keeping the worst most dangerous weapons out of certain people's hand, it must be hard to imagine how you can ensure that by pulling out of this deal. What do you say to President Trump when you try to persuade him diplomatically that what is the option?</p><p>HUNT: Well, we have exactly the same destination as the U.S. Now, President Trump's view is the way to do that is to renegotiate, get a new deal, a different deal to the nuclear deal. We want to be very careful to make sure that we don't throw the baby out with the bottle.</p><p>So, lots of people said President Trump was going to be an isolation as president. Far from it, he is very, very involved and he has, as we can see, very strong views about how to get there. What we want to do I to make sure that as that situation evolves we don't see Iran restarting its nuclear program.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Federica Mogherini, the U.S. Foreign Policy Chief, said that you all are trying to figure out other, as she put it, mechanism to enable Iran to benefit from the economic pledges in return for its abiding by the Iran nuclear deal. And that if it doesn't feel like, and certainly the Iranian president told me this week that they would have to pull out. We're just going to play a quick soundbite, part of my interview with Federica Mogherini on this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEDERICA MOGHERINI, E.U. HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: We are putting in place mechanisms together with the Europeans but also with the Russians, with the Chinese, with others in the world, from all over the world, to create the channels to keep trad within them that would guaranty that trade can continue, regardless of the secondary sanctions that United States have put.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: What kind of mechanisms could you all put in place to save the economic part of this deal? Because you're all pulling your own companies out because of secondary sanction threats.</p><p>HUNT: Well, it's very important not to characterize what European nations are doing as being soft on Iran. I sat in a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif this week at the U.N. General Assembly when country after country that was a signatory to the Iran nuclear deal was being extremely tough with the Iranians. And they were saying, \"If you diverge from this treaty in way at all, even the smallest way and you start your nuclear ambitions again, then we're out of this deal.\"</p><p>And so, this is a very tough situation for Iran because they aren't getting the full benefit of the deal that they were getting when the United States was part of it. But they're getting Europeans saying, you know, \"You so much as blink on your commitments and we'll pull right out.\"</p><p>And so, that is what we're trying to do. We're trying to make sure that in a very difficult situation, the one thing we don't lose is a nonnuclear Iran.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Federica Mogherini specifically said that the United Kingdom and others were trying to figure out almost a way around, like mechanism, she said, that you or the Chinese, Russians, the others, could continue your business obligations to Iran as long as it kept its obligations under the nuclear deal.</p><p>Can you tell us what those mechanism might be? How might you be able to actually have your businesses working with Iran?</p><p>HUNT: Well, as detail were going on into the precise nature of those mechanisms. But what I would say on the win-win issue is that, of course, this is a deal and there has to be enough of a win for Iran to stop them at restarting their nuclear program. But we don't want there to be so much of a win that they are not deterred from the very malign activities that are destabilizing the whole of that region.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You once said about President Trump, you said, \"The traditional Western Foreign-Policy has been that if we disapprove of something somebody has done, we just don't take action but we stop the engagement as well. Donald Trump takes a view that actually you need to engage with people. I think it's a business mentality. He's always looking for a way to recast the deal.\"</p><p>Do you still feel that way about Trump? I mean, do you think there is method to madness, as some people might describe?</p><p>HUNT: I do think that he does look at the world in terms of the various deals that America signed up to. And rather than want to tear down the firmament and abandon the whole international rural space system, he's basically saying, \"Look, I accept the need for deals but they need to be deals that work for America.\"</p><p>And I think if you look at, for example, his approach to the NATO summit that we had this July, he arrived in a very competent mood because actually, this is something we agree with him on, European allies are not contributing as much as they should to the NATO budget. The U.S. is spending far more as a proportion its GDP.</p><p>He left the NATO summit a very happy, very committed to NATO because he had secured some commitment for extra funding from the European side. So I think it's important to understand his methods which is the method to start by making people sweat and think about the possibility of American withdrawal. But fundamentally, in the end, I think he does understand the importance of some of the really important alliances that underpin the international order.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I wonder what you make about his speech at the United Nations. He was very clear that this was about a sovereign America. And that he rejected the idea as he said of globalism and embrace the idea of a national doctrine of patriotism and he noted that on everybody. As if there were sort of mutually exclusive, you can't be patriotic if you are globalist or whatever.</p><p>And, of course, Europe sovereignty is being breached if he says that he's going to threaten you with secondary sanctions for doing business under an internationally recognized deal. So I just wonder how you can stand up for yourself, how does Europe stand up for itself. And perhaps even your reaction to some of these books that have come out about his policy like you talked about NATO. His national security advisor came over and had all this stuff signed up before the president who comes and have a different view and maybe method ups so to speak.</p><p>HUNT: Well, I think we have to understand the reasons why President Trump is saying what he is saying. And it's connected to the reasons why he was elected which is that he has a base and we have similar possible place the U.K. and Europe as well that feel disoriented and worried by globalization. And that was probably something that was a contributor to the Brexit in the U.K. and indeed to some of the political turbulence in other parts of Europe. And he's saying people need to know that their political leaders are standing up for their country's interests and this isn't -- and their identity isn't being compromised by some of the winds of change.</p><p>And so I think it is very important to recognize there is a role for multinational institutions but also to recognize that they do need to be reformed. And the U.K. certainly stands with the U.S. on reform of the U.N., reform of the WTO, reform of NATO. These institutions have got to work for the big players who operate within them and that was one of the insights when the U.N. was set up with its rather -- with the structure of the Security Council, the permanent members of vetoes that recognize the difference between bigger countries and smaller countries.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Since you mentioned Brexit, I wanted to ask you to react. I mean I'm sure that when you come here, the majority of your counterparts look at you still as if you put a gun to your head and, you know, embarked on a journey to who knows where at this moment. None of us know exactly where it's going because there still isn't a deal.</p><p>But I wonder how you react to several recent developments. In the latest meeting with the E.U., Donald Tusk famously offered promise to Mason Cakes and then tweeted that there won't be any cherries, no cherry picking. And then President Macron went even further and he was actually very blunt about the Brexiters and the policies that he said they had sold to the voters. This is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): The Brexit teaches us something -- and I completely respect British sovereignty when I say that. It showed that those who say that we can easily leave without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it's going to bring in a lot of money are liars. And it is even more true since they left the day after so they wouldn't have to deal with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean he has a point, right? There are a lot of things that Brexit promised, the Brexiters promised, that are just pie in the sky.</p><p>HUNT: I think the first thing to say is that we need some perspective here. It's a very big decision when a country decides to leave an organization like the European Union that was always going to be a very difficult negotiation. We're coming to the crunch periods now and what I see behind the scenes is that there is a tremendous desire on both sides to actually come to an agreement because not coming to an agreement will be damaging all around. And so that is the first point to make. But I think some of those comments are really based on a misunderstanding of why the British people voted for Brexit.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But you did say -- you used to be health secretary and you did say some of the Brexit slogans were lies and even your side says that 350 million whatever it was pounds or euros to the NHS was not true and not a deliverable promise.</p><p>HUNT: Well, we're a democracy. And when you have a referendum campaign, just like when you have an election campaign, there are lots of claims made on both sides. In the case of the funding for the NHS, there were lots of voices saying that's not the whole picture. And people listened to those voices and they made their decision and that's what happens in a democracy.</p><p>But the most important thing is this was not a decision by the British people to reject Europe, to be un-European to be anti-European. We have a country that just shed more blood in Europe, has sacrificed more than perhaps anyone else for peace, prosperity, and stability in Europe but we do want our sovereignty back. We want a different legal relationship but we want to carry on the friendship with European partners and colleagues.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you think the Prime Minister's seen off a leadership challenge for now?</p><p>HUNT: She is very secure. I mean, of course, newspapers will write the articles they want to write. But people understand that she's someone of enormous tenacity resilience. She's had a very very difficult few years with the Brexit situation but she has brought us forward and she's brought us to the point where a deal is possible and now we just need to see it through.</p><p>AMANPOUR: One of the issues on your agenda, you've been tweeting about it, is some of the British citizens who are held by Iran. For instance, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. You've again said that you've been talking about it. Prime Minister May said that she spoke to the president of Iran about it. I asked the president of Iran yesterday, this is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): Well, I'm not aware of the details of any detainees' files but I have heard that new charges were brought against her and the judiciary was awaiting the response from the defense. So these are actions that are taking place in the judiciary.</p><p>But if efforts of foreign governments can be beneficial with this -- for example, when we talk about our citizens being imprisoned in other countries, in Western countries, when we talk about those to the government officials, they tell us, \"Well, there's not much we can do because they're under the guise of the judiciary in our country.\" So we must all bring a constant concerted effort to their house so that all prisoners must be free, they're returned to their families but it must be a path that travels both ways.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: That's their view. What is your hope? And have you made any progress with trying to make sure that this British citizen who's done nothing wrong as a civilian gets released and was going to get out? We thought last Christmas she was going to come out.</p><p>HUNT: It is not acceptable for Iran -- by the way, it isn't just Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. There are others as well in the same situation. We don't mention names and the families are happy with that. But it is not acceptable to detain innocent people as a tool of diplomatic leverage. And that is what is happening and it's just not acceptable. And I made that very clear to her Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif.</p><p>We need this situation to be resolved. We need these people to be able to come home. And Britain is not a country that is just going to stand by and allow this kind of injustice to continue so we need to see progress.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You're still tweeting about your gas, your faux pas, about your wife. You said that she was Japanese instead of Chinese and you just said it -- you tweeted humorously about it in Japan. Are you going to limit down?</p><p>HUNT: I don't know. Certainly great to have a discussion within the hundred (ph) family. The truth is -- I'm not sure I've said this on broadcast before but I speak Japanese and I spoke -- the last time I met the Chinese foreign minister, we've spoken in Japanese and that's --</p><p>AMANPOUR: With the Chinese foreign minister?</p><p>HUNT: With the Chinese foreign minister because he used to be the ambassador in Tokyo. And so I was just muddling up my small talk but luckily I have a wife who has a great sense of humor.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Luckily. Foreign Secretary, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>HUNT: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Sense of humor is vitally important at all times.</p><p>Turning now to one of the most successful investors in big tech and innovation Alexis Ohanian, a self-made millionaire. He started making waves as the co-founder of the social media platform Reddit, one of the most visited websites in the United States. And most recently, with his venture capital firm Initialized Capital which makes early bets on startups like the grocery delivery service into the cart and the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase.</p><p>But his celebrity status soared after marrying tennis champ Serena Williams last year, three months after welcoming their baby daughter Olympia. Alexis recently sat down with our Hari Sreenivasan for a masterclass in business and parenthood.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CONTRIBUTOR: All right. First, let's talk about the big money part of it. Initialized Capital. You look at your website. You've got 125 plus companies. So how do you figure, out of your 120 plus bets, how many of them need to become super successful?</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yes. I mean there are, you know, for every one Coinbase or Instacart, there are 20, 30, 40 that won't survive. And that's the math that at this kind of early stage of investing actually still works. It really is a power law where the returns from these one or two big bets that are successful makeup for all the others that aren't. The upside of that is it lets us be a little bit more aggressive and be able to take sort of bigger bets or bolder bets on ideas that are a little further out there.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You've also made a bet in the driverless car space.</p><p>OHANIAN: Yes.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: That's been on Cruise. That would be a partner that was acquired by G.M.</p><p>OHANIAN: That's right. So we grew the first investors in Cruise. It was just -- at that point, it was basically a research project because no startup back in 2012 really thought that they could compete with the likes of Google or Uber, these others. And then we went back a second time actually, invested in another self-driving car company called Voyage.</p><p>Their approach is a little different. What they found was an opportunity where they're able to get their cars on the roads today by using retirement communities. These are large swaths of land that have many many miles of roads that look and train the computers just like any other road. It's contained, it's private land, and so they can work with these retirement communities and offer an amazing service to people who are otherwise pretty limited in mobility, right.</p><p>The idea that your grandparents can have a self-driving taxi service to help take them to the store, gives them mobility and freedom they didn't have before. And in fact, the cars only go like 25 miles an hour is actually a feature. That's actually probably how fast most of those cars would be going if the elderly were behind the wheel anyway.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Right.</p><p>OHANIAN: And it's finding a way to use this technology that is practical and valuable and safe but also collecting data now in real time regularly on real roads. And I think long term, that's where the value is going to be. These cars will get smarter the more hours they spend on the roads because these cameras, this AI is constantly learning and absorbing and improving.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a little bit about the content struggles a lot of these platforms are having to deal with right now. I mean the kind of the enforce (ph) conundrum. The president recently weighed in and he is warning people about the power of the platforms, their political influence, they don't like me in the first place. But is their concern that they are so powerful now that they are players in the political process?</p><p>OHANIAN: So interesting because now it's coming -- so it's coming from the left and the right. I think these platforms are trying very very hard to maintain a neutrality and --</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Is that possible?</p><p>OHANIAN: -- the reality is -- ultimately I don't think that's possible. I think with Google, Facebook and these others haven't done so well though is entrenched themselves in our lives in such a fundamental way for so long that I do believe -- I mean part of what we do is look for an early stage investor who wants to do something as audacious as topple Google or topple Facebook one day or build a competitor to them. But admittedly, the impact that they've been able to have and build up is wide-reaching and it affects many many parts of our life.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Reddit in a way has become, as you guys call it, the front page of the Internet, right. But beyond the front page, behind it, there are also places where you find incredibly distasteful speech. I mean you can find it on forums that support the president right now, really racist memes that would attack you for being Armenian or your wife for being African-American, right. I mean so what is -- how do you solve for that?</p><p>OHANIAN: Well, it is reprehensible. And I do remember, this was many years ago, the first time I had an Armenian genocide denial posed at me. On the one hand, I thought, \"OK. Well, you know, this is despicable and obviously, I hate it.\" And at the same time, I thought, \"OK. Well, I guess like we're at a scale now where this is a real -- this is the reality. We're now a global enough platform that we're seeing these worldviews that are so awful and so offensive.\"</p><p>The solution for how do we fix it is a bigger -- this is a bigger global one I think. I do think that through more exposure and through more communication, we do get to more empathy and understanding. Through more conversation, we get there and I've seen it in glimpses on Reddit. I've seen and I do believe that long-term, sunlight and truth wins.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: But that's a really long term. I mean very long. Theologically, irrational people who hold despicable points of view are not often convinced by facts. They're not convinced by --</p><p>OHANIAN: We have a flat earth theory going around right now that's picking up steam. Like a flat earth theory in 2018. You know I remember reading about The Enlightenment. And I think when I was -- I think when I was studying it in history, I just sort of assumed that like there was this enlightenment. And then after that, like everyone was like cool, rational thought, scientific method. Like, great world's fixed, it started, it's done. And I pretty -- I guess I really naively sort of thought that.</p><p>And this is surfacing now, this reality that like no actually there are a lot of people for whom this -- like just sort of miss or who even today just don't care, and would rather see things that reinforce their world. Like explicitly, would rather see things that reinforce their worldview than challenge it with data.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Is there a rule for regulation then?</p><p>OHANIAN: I can imagine that coming from this president given his history of being very anti-regulation. I think there is still -- I mean I think there is still real competition. I do -- I mean actually we have -- one of our big thesis is around the like anti-Amazon thesis where because of Amazon's place in the market, when they decide to go into something, it creates an amazing opportunity for startups to basically arm their opponents.</p><p>And so we saw this most recently with comical standard cognition which does self-checkout. When Amazon launched, it was Amazon Go to Self-Checkout Store, just pick up the peanuts and walk out. Every retailer realized, \"Oh no. I'm going to bring more. I don't have this work. What do I do?\" Exactly.</p><p>And because they know they can't build it themselves, they come to a startup like Standard Cognition and then started with customers. So I do see that actually serving as a tremendous boon for competition. But the reality is the incumbents themselves have neglected technology so much, they can't build it themselves. They can't go to their CTO and say, \"OK. We need a solution in eight months.\" Just the engineering talent isn't there. There's just -- they're unable to build it. They have to partner with these startups.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a little bit about your much longer-term investments.</p><p>OHANIAN: My family.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Yes. So you're married to Serena Williams. Is she as competitive off the court as she is on the court?</p><p>OHANIAN: Yes.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Have you ever beat her on anything?</p><p>OHANIAN: Oh, yes. It's just -- I mean there's a few video games. Actually, there's a few that she'll still -- she'll wash me in the classics, the classic NES games she's better at but it's less about competition with someone else. It's more about her own -- almost like a competition with herself. She is one of the sort of hardest people on themselves who I know and that's what makes her great.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: And a humbling experience? I mean you said at one point that you thought you worked hard.</p><p>OHANIAN: Oh, yes. I thought I worked so hard. Tech is full of these myths around, you know, nonstop working in the grind, in the hassle and all this stuff and I really believed I was like, \"OK. Well, I'm in the hardest working industry. They're working all the time. Your doors never close. It's 24/7 Internet blah blah blah.\" And yes, I was so wrong, very very wrong.</p><p>I think what I didn't really appreciate, what I didn't really understand until I saw it first hand was what a pressure it is and what an intensity it is to do your job in front of so many people, but there is so much on you when you are out there. I used to hate tennis. I thought tennis was a boring sport. I would change the channel. It was -- I was so wrong. And to see what she's been able to do at the level she's done it in a sport where it's just you, it's just you out there, is just amazing. It's absolutely amazing.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: One of the things that she did which was surprising and startling to a lot of people was she was very open about going through postpartum depression. It's just not something that a lot of women share, much less women of her fame and fortune so to speak. But it's also not something that men talk about.</p><p>OHANIAN: I mean, look, as a husband, I just want to be there. I want to be the rock. I want to be supportive. And it is already so much to carry a child, to have a child, to do all of that. Not to mention all the complications that she had to go through and endure. Yes. I mean I was so -- I was very proud of her for speaking about it publicly.</p><p>She realizes the platform she has in the world. And I think what's so special is she's always been very unfiltered. And when you combine her level of success with this unfiltered nature, I think there's a hunger for this realness because there's a lot that isn't that --</p><p>SREENIVASAN: That so much is just polished and part of the presentations of the vacation that you had and whatever but --</p><p>OHANIAN: Our Instagram culture. And look, I'm guilty of it too. Like it is the rose-tinted sort of best version of yourself that you want to present to the world. And I think that's fine and that's something we as humans want but that creates a hunger for that real talk. And, you know, I've had so many people just randomly come up to me, and mothers in particular, just walking down the street now who will thank me for -- and I'm like why are you thanking me, it's just sent along to your wife because of what she said and what she's talked about and how much it means to them. And I'm happy, very happy, to deliver that thanks.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You got a one-year-old, what is she teaching you?</p><p>OHANIAN: That everything I've done up until this point, not that cool, not that great. As proud as I was of all the things I've done in my career, I just -- I look at that little baby and I'm just like this is my legacy.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Recently, an associate on Instagram criticized you for taking what he called family vacation and response resonated with a lot of parents.</p><p>OHANIAN: Yes.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Was the vacation wild?</p><p>OHANIAN: That was wild. It's like a week with my fam and yes. An associate in another V.C. firm had made some note about being -- implying that I wasn't working hard. And I was on vacation but I think this kind of goes back to that the same notion that tech has in our little bubble that we are this -- we have to be this hardest working 24/7, got to grind mentality which is just -- it's not true but it's also dangerous.</p><p>I worry because there is so much, especially in masculinity tied up in the grind and the hassle and work, and especially when it comes to family where there had been a huge proponent for paid family leave because I want men to be taking time off. I want women to be able to take time off.</p><p>I mean right now we have, I think one in four American women, are back at work two weeks later after having a kid. I think that's insane. To be the last developed country to not have any kind of policy is insane. And I've spoken about it. I took four months leave.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: And you're fortunate to be able to do that.</p><p>OHANIAN: And I was very lucky to do that. And that is something I will give the tech industry credit for. It is a pretty standard thing to have generous parental leave policies intact and I hope it can be a standard for other industries but I want it to be a standard for the country. And if there is that policy in place, taking advantage of it is another level because so many men still don't.</p><p>And this provides a sort of double advantage because one, it means men get to spend time with their families during these early days which are really important. But it also gives more air cover to women in the organization to take time off and help to start to change a lot of those cultural and systemic problems that exist in tech and in business around women in the workforce. And so I was proud to take all my time off. And I'm happy to be speaking out about it because it is very hard to try and balance it all.</p><p>And actually, for the first time, it was like a month ago at the Commonwealth Club, actually got asked the question my wife's been asked plenty of times which was how do you balance at all work and family. And I was happy to be asked it because I hadn't gotten asked it and I know she gets asked it in so many working women, moms who get asked it all the time. And I would like us all to get asked that enough that we just never - it never even becomes an issue anymore, it just becomes a question.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: All right. Alexis Ohanian, thanks for joining us.</p><p>OHANIAN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, in the wake of Serena's very public outburst at the U.S. Open Final over a dispute with the umpire, Ohanian dismissed the New York Times article that claimed men are more penalized than women in tennis saying it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges.</p><p>That is it for our program. Thanks for watching. Watch us online.</p><p>Goodbye from London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018100101cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TD2-9N51-JB20-G0HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 1, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Nations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Human Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nuclear Weapons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sexual Harassment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Women</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Cruising</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUZBNzY1Qzg1Q0U3NDZGMzkxQTM4QjQ4RkUxMDgwQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjY1RENBNzc2NUE5NDgzOEI1MDEwMDVFMjI4QjFDMDQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DM2F</classCode><className>METOO MOVEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D4JV</classCode><className>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJX1</classCode><className>FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

Oceanwide is seeking additional construction financing, and a deal could close in the next few months, said the sources, who weren't authorized to speak publicly. The amount and source of funding isn't clear.</p><p> The city's ongoing boom, with San Francisco and Silicon Valley companies competing for space and talent in tech's new heartland, will likely bolster the project. Still, Oceanwide Center is the only major office project under construction in San Francisco that doesn't have a tenant, though some tech companies are interested.</p><p>Salesforce, the city's biggest private tenant, is considering a lease for all 1 million square feet of office space, or room for more than 6,000 employees, according to two people familiar with the company's discussions. A deal \u2014 which could be the biggest lease in city history \u2014 has not been signed. Salesforce \u2014 which also leases about two-thirds of the Salesforce Tower \u2014 declined to comment.</p><p> Amy Jalili, an Oceanwide spokeswoman, said it is \"committed to completing the project,\" and targeting an opening in 2022. She declined to comment on financing or leasing activity. Construction started in late 2016 and is ongoing.</p><p>Oceanwide, a Beijing conglomerate with $2.4 billion in 2017 revenue, is facing challenges with another large project. In January, it stalled construction on its $1 billion Oceanwide Plaza project in downtown Los Angeles as it sought to \"restructure capital,\" according to the Los Angeles Times. Construction restarted in March. Oceanwide is also selling a New York building after owning it for three years, according to the Commercial Observer.</p><p>Oceanwide is seeking more money in a more difficult environment for Chinese investors in the U.S.</p><p> Chinese foreign direct investment in the U.S. plunged from $29 billion in 2017 to $4.8 billion last year, according to research firm the Rhodium Group. The drop followed capital restrictions by the Chinese government. The Trump administration has also raised tariffs on Chinese goods and sought to block some Chinese investments in the U.S., such as a 2017 bid for San Jose company Lattice Semiconductor. However, Oceanwide received U.S. approval to take over Virginia insurance firm Genworth Financial.</p><p> Other Chinese developers such as Z&amp;L Properties have faced project delays and lawsuits amid the financial restrictions and the Bay Area's complex land use and construction regulations.</p><p>Oceanwide has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the San Francisco project. In 2015, the developer paid $296 million for the Oceanwide Center site at 50 First St., part of a wave in Chinese investment in the Bay Area and around the country. Oceanwide will also pay $130 million in city fees for community benefits like transportation improvements, The Chronicle previously reported.</p><p> Developer Boston Properties, which owns nearby Salesforce Tower, has said Oceanwide Center is drawing interest from other parties.</p><p> \"The project has got some, I think, some timing issues. Lots of people are trying to understand how they might be helpful in that situation,\" Owen Thomas, CEO of Boston Properties, said on an earnings call last week. He declined to answer questions on the call about whether Boston Properties is seeking involvement in Oceanwide Center.</p><p> Oceanwide Center is poised to benefit from San Francisco's tight office market, which has a vacancy rate under 6%. But future office projects in central South of Market are grappling with multiple lawsuits against recent legislation that raised building heights there. The city's 1986 Proposition M caps the amount of office space that can be approved each year.</p><p> The dearth of space and continued demand from the tech industry has led to leases for future buildings that haven't even been approved by the city, such as Salesforce's lease at 564 Howard St. and Pinterest's deal at 88 Bluxome St.</p><p> \"The vacancy rate is at its lowest level since this last cycle began after the great financial crisis.
