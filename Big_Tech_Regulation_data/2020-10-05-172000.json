The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-e4d2e78911714528888d98c1326c0330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C247-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He will now be detained in hospital before he's sent to prison for a minimum of 12 years. </p><p>Leigh Milner, BBC News. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-1d68a0faad344ff7b6ef674fb9a925cc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C225-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-30033713f184434d9d6c59e36557e930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C229-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He will now be detained in hospital before he's sent to prison for a minimum of 12 years. </p><p>Leigh Milner, BBC News. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-f6ad3f67b1e1471e815f335fda8c72b3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C24D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He will now be detained in hospital before he's sent to prison for a minimum of 12 years. Leigh Milner, BBC News. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. </p><p>The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-3b04f835b70c4f27805af02d8ff4e458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C226-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Leigh Milner, BBC News. </p><p>The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-5a9d73d5eb8942db98855122945ca44b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C27H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-e419df82609f4a39b9523c7a997a65a3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C245-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He will now be detained in hospital before he's sent to prison for a minimum of 12 years. </p><p>Leigh Milner, BBC News. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-8d4e2d3631b44fc6855d61ce0be40a1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C22W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-a4a85a0c253d42a7bffeef500bafa423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C21V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Passing the sentence, the judge said it was terrifying to watch. He will now be detained in hospital before he's sent to prison for a minimum of 12 years. Leigh Milner, BBC News. </p><p>The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos a new population in this African country.

Passing the sentence, the judge said it was terrifying to watch. He will now be detained in hospital before he's sent to prison for a minimum of 12 years. Leigh Milner, BBC News. </p><p>The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former Deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but after a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, today five rhinos were reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they will need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects like locating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-7d09e0da9034458984b106e6d2f2dd50</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-7CK1-JBH6-C22P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online?

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will need</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-d58fb60b2888464f96e0a1d89b23f6bd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-340C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will need</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-14f52ce4bf4548289b92e29f7bcbdc4b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will need</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-887cdadf73834489b9b85783bee53e44</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will need</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-05fe53fd18b34858a3b02a32893863bf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will need</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-327645059d284b38b4347725953c4f16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33VS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-a23bb5c4bc154139b0576fab918996b5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-2bfad4bcba5544618eb405ffeb1454f4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the law stands, all the data belongs to the tech companies not the family. Angus Crawford reports. When a child dies, what happens to their online life, their messages, posts and pictures, their most personal data?</p><p> That's an agonising question for Molly Russell's dad, Ian. There's data on her electronic devices that we can't access. It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the?wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-140cdbe102544454b56f984660e7d94f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-33YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. </p><p>Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at this station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well, today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them, by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the wider issue of how you shift power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or to stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed - today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when and not if new rules are created to govern it. Amol Rajan there.

President Trump finally delivered his annual State of the Union address last night after being delayed for a month because of the US Government shutdown. The President spoke of unity and cooperation. But he also brought up some of the big issues that divide America, like abortion and immigration, and he vowed once again to build the border wall with Mexico. He also announced that he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader this month. Our North America editor, Jon Sopel, reports. Madam Speaker, the President of the United States! You emerge into the chamber like a prizefighter before a heavyweight championship bout, but Donald Trump, the great counterpuncher, had seemingly come with an outstretched arm, not a left hook.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-986486cc59c44fb7ab506b1a7b5c402e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC6-DHS1-DY08-3410-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the arrow, as many other drugs companies face potential legal action.

It's 11 o'clock, and these are the main stories this morning. Tech companies could be fined or blocked if they fail to protect children. Campaigners say the plans would make Britain a world pioneer. </p><p>Five days before the UK is due to leave the EU without a deal, Labour say they are still waiting to hear about more talks with the Government to try to break the deadlock. At the moment we haven't seen a change of position from the government. If there is a change of position, we need to consider that, we will consider it. So we will have to see what happens today. You can't go into any of those discussions with big red lines, because otherwise there is no point in having them, but we are very clear about the type of Brexit that we want. The ultra low emission zone. The new pollution charge comes into force in central London to tackle the capital's toxic air. A British woman faces a prison sentence in Dubai For calling her ex husband's new wife a horse. It is just shocking. No one would expect that having posted something on Facebook several years ago it could possibly lead to such a traumatic experience. The fatal accident inquiry into the Clutha helicopter crash in Glasgow begins this morning. Kirstjen Nielsen, the woman who has enforced some President Trump's more controversial border policies, resigned as US secretary of homeland security. Good morning. Welcome to BBC Newsroom Live. For the first time, internet sites and social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The Government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomed the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, set out the plans a short time ago in central London Last year, Facebook revealed over 14 million pieces of content related to extremism or terrorism. In three months, they moved 8.7 million items that breached policies on Child nudity and sexual exploitation. But how much more illegal material remains? And how much damage is being done by this cruel content is even less clear. The cyber bullying, the trolling, the posts glorifying self-harm. Truly horrifying content that is linked to depression, anxiety, mental health problems and even suicide. Sajid Javid speaking earlier. Now, with just five days to go before Britain is due to leave the EU, Labour is still waiting to learn whether the government will put forward proposals which could break the impasse over Brexit. The Prime Minister says both parties</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-9f311ea9a4f94880bf61b2cb57006c92</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV4-NKG1-JBH6-C42N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

At the moment we haven't seen a change of position from the government. If there is a change of position, we need to consider that, we will consider it. So we will have to see what happens today. You can't go into any of those discussions with big red lines, because otherwise there is no point in having them, but we are very clear about the type of Brexit that we want. The ultra low emission zone. The new pollution charge comes into force in central London to tackle the capital's toxic air. A British woman faces a prison sentence in Dubai For calling her ex husband's new wife a horse. It is just shocking. No one would expect that having posted something on Facebook several years ago it could possibly lead to such a traumatic experience. The fatal accident inquiry into the Clutha helicopter crash in Glasgow begins this morning. Kirstjen Nielsen, the woman who has enforced some President Trump's more controversial border policies, resigned as US secretary of homeland security. Good morning. Welcome to BBC Newsroom Live. For the first time, internet sites and social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The Government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomed the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, set out the plans a short time ago in central London Last year, Facebook revealed over 14 million pieces of content related to extremism or terrorism. In three months, they moved 8.7 million items that breached policies on Child nudity and sexual exploitation. But how much more illegal material remains? And how much damage is being done by this cruel content is even less clear. The cyber bullying, the trolling, the posts glorifying self-harm. Truly horrifying content that is linked to depression, anxiety, mental health problems and even suicide. Sajid Javid speaking earlier. Now, with just five days to go before Britain is due to leave the EU, Labour is still waiting to learn whether the government will put forward proposals which could break the impasse over Brexit. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal but they failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings, and she's been heavily criticised by some Conservatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCTWO-3cceb9be2d374d9bb085747a6b7c8439</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCTWO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV4-NKG1-JBH6-C447-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402047</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal but they failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings, and she's been heavily criticised by some Conservatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC2WA-b660655e04d94527b29a420cd9656d09</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC2WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV4-NKG1-JBH6-C448-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But you are accepting... To some, it will sound as if he will say, don't blame us, nothing we can do, if you think there's a problem you go and sort it out. I don't think it's an issue of blame, I think it is right that companies like Facebook and acknowledge the mistakes that they have made. </p><p>And of course mistakes have been made. It is just that I don't think that it is in any way conceivable, and more than that, I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies, the United States or elsewhere, can or should do elsewhere. And I'm of the view that some people sort of yell at Tech, I think it's important that we fix stack and resolve this tension that does exist between the amazing benefits that technology brings but it also brings risks to society. And I want to see, and that's part of my new job, companies like Facebook play an increasingly mature role, not shunning regulation but actually advocating it any sensible way. Let's get more on this from an analyst at a research service focusing on tech and media, thanks for coming in. Nick Clegg says it's not right for private companies to set the rules of the road. In terms of rules being set for the tech companies, what progress is being made? There is a lot of moves on different fronts. The UK Government has taken a bit of a lead on this recently, they released at the paper that called for tech companies to have a duty of care for their platforms, which would be quite a radical departure from the current regime tech companies aren't legally responsible for what is shared on their platforms, it is the user that is responsible. There are moves in the US, calls to break up the big tech companies from several leading Democratic nominees for the 2020 presidential race, and there have been a lot of moves on the EU level to regulate data protection and privacy. So the conversation has certainly progressed beyond where it was a few years ago. What do you think about that stance, to say, well, it's not for us to do it, let's let the various authorities do it because unless the company seem to be responsible, who knows what governments might come up with and some of these might be punitive for the companies. If that was the case with companies go along with it? They would have to obey the law, they all say that they obey the law in the jurisdictions they operate. In terms of that messaging, it has been consistent for Facebook recently that they want responsible regulation is applied consistently across companies and across the world. And I think that is the right move, because these are such important channels of communication and they have such an influence over the information that we see and the way we communicate, there does need to be some democratic input. The question to my mind is, Facebook says they want all of these things but when there comes a specific, you know, specific proposals that might actually affect how much money they make, they are much more vague about what they want. So the question is, is this just lip service to the idea of democratic accountability or are they serious this time? It does sort of take us back to the enduring question, which is why is it so difficult for companies to get to grips with it, anyway? Facebook and other social media platforms have come under a lot of criticism for material being on their platforms are not being taken down. Why is it so complicated? Well, they're huge, for a start. Facebook has 2 billion users plus globally, on operating in different markets, different cultural sensitivities, political situations. And they have not invested money to properly moderate all of these nuances, so you see all these really harmful outcomes from places like Sri Lanka and Myanmar where they haven't been on top of that, and the reason it's so difficult is because it's so big and they just haven't put the money in to deal with these problems. On the other issue that he tackles is influence of social media and different countries in what happens in elections, obviously Cambridge Analytica and the influence potentially of what happened there was discussed and he is saying, actually, it's the traditional media over 40 years that has had a much greater impact on people'sattitudes</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-62511e9e33944de59cd53eb0edde17b9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-DWS1-DY08-3232-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But you are accepting... To some, it will sound as if he will say, don't blame us, nothing we can do, if you think there's a problem you go and sort it out. I don't think it's an issue of blame, I think it is right that companies like Facebook and acknowledge the mistakes that they have made. </p><p>And of course mistakes have been made. It is just that I don't think that it is in any way conceivable, and more than that, I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies, the United States or elsewhere, can or should do elsewhere. And I'm of the view that some people sort of yell at Tech, I think it's important that we fix stack and resolve this tension that does exist between the amazing benefits that technology brings but it also brings risks to society. And I want to see, and that's part of my new job, companies like Facebook play an increasingly mature role, not shunning regulation but actually advocating it any sensible way. Let's get more on this from an analyst at a research service focusing on tech and media, thanks for coming in. Nick Clegg says it's not right for private companies to set the rules of the road. In terms of rules being set for the tech companies, what progress is being made? There is a lot of moves on different fronts. The UK Government has taken a bit of a lead on this recently, they released at the paper that called for tech companies to have a duty of care for their platforms, which would be quite a radical departure from the current regime tech companies aren't legally responsible for what is shared on their platforms, it is the user that is responsible. There are moves in the US, calls to break up the big tech companies from several leading Democratic nominees for the 2020 presidential race, and there have been a lot of moves on the EU level to regulate data protection and privacy. So the conversation has certainly progressed beyond where it was a few years ago. What do you think about that stance, to say, well, it's not for us to do it, let's let the various authorities do it because unless the company seem to be responsible, who knows what governments might come up with and some of these might be punitive for the companies. If that was the case with companies go along with it? They would have to obey the law, they all say that they obey the law in the jurisdictions they operate. In terms of that messaging, it has been consistent for Facebook recently that they want responsible regulation is applied consistently across companies and across the world. And I think that is the right move, because these are such important channels of communication and they have such an influence over the information that we see and the way we communicate, there does need to be some democratic input. The question to my mind is, Facebook says they want all of these things but when there comes a specific, you know, specific proposals that might actually affect how much money they make, they are much more vague about what they want. So the question is, is this just lip service to the idea of democratic accountability or are they serious this time? It does sort of take us back to the enduring question, which is why is it so difficult for companies to get to grips with it, anyway? Facebook and other social media platforms have come under a lot of criticism for material being on their platforms are not being taken down. Why is it so complicated? Well, they're huge, for a start. Facebook has 2 billion users plus globally, on operating in different markets, different cultural sensitivities, political situations. And they have not invested money to properly moderate all of these nuances, so you see all these really harmful outcomes from places like Sri Lanka and Myanmar where they haven't been on top of that, and the reason it's so difficult is because it's so big and they just haven't put the money in to deal with these problems. On the other issue that he tackles is influence of social media and different countries in what happens in elections, obviously Cambridge Analytica and the influence potentially of what happened there was discussed and he is saying, actually, it's the traditional media over 40 years that has had a much greater impact on people'sattitudes than social media currently. Obviously that makes sense because</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC2WA-98ce6884e3d146e6811b5d6c97bcb59f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC2WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-DWS1-DY08-324X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It is just that I don't think that it is in any way conceivable, and more than that, I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies, the United States or elsewhere, can or should do elsewhere. And I'm of the view that some people sort of yell at Tech, I think it's important that we fix stack and resolve this tension that does exist between the amazing benefits that technology brings but it also brings risks to society. And I want to see, and that's part of my new job, companies like Facebook play an increasingly mature role, not shunning regulation but actually advocating it any sensible way. Let's get more on this from an analyst at a research service focusing on tech and media, thanks for coming in. Nick Clegg says it's not right for private companies to set the rules of the road. In terms of rules being set for the tech companies, what progress is being made? There is a lot of moves on different fronts. The UK Government has taken a bit of a lead on this recently, they released at the paper that called for tech companies to have a duty of care for their platforms, which would be quite a radical departure from the current regime tech companies aren't legally responsible for what is shared on their platforms, it is the user that is responsible. There are moves in the US, calls to break up the big tech companies from several leading Democratic nominees for the 2020 presidential race, and there have been a lot of moves on the EU level to regulate data protection and privacy. So the conversation has certainly progressed beyond where it was a few years ago. What do you think about that stance, to say, well, it's not for us to do it, let's let the various authorities do it because unless the company seem to be responsible, who knows what governments might come up with and some of these might be punitive for the companies. If that was the case with companies go along with it? They would have to obey the law, they all say that they obey the law in the jurisdictions they operate. In terms of that messaging, it has been consistent for Facebook recently that they want responsible regulation is applied consistently across companies and across the world. And I think that is the right move, because these are such important channels of communication and they have such an influence over the information that we see and the way we communicate, there does need to be some democratic input. The question to my mind is, Facebook says they want all of these things but when there comes a specific, you know, specific proposals that might actually affect how much money they make, they are much more vague about what they want. So the question is, is this just lip service to the idea of democratic accountability or are they serious this time? It does sort of take us back to the enduring question, which is why is it so difficult for companies to get to grips with it, anyway? Facebook and other social media platforms have come under a lot of criticism for material being on their platforms are not being taken down. Why is it so complicated? Well, they're huge, for a start. Facebook has 2 billion users plus globally, on operating in different markets, different cultural sensitivities, political situations. And they have not invested money to properly moderate all of these nuances, so you see all these really harmful outcomes from places like Sri Lanka and Myanmar where they haven't been on top of that, and the reason it's so difficult is because it's so big and they just haven't put the money in to deal with these problems. On the other issue that he tackles is influence of social media and different countries in what happens in elections, obviously Cambridge Analytica and the influence potentially of what happened there was discussed and he is saying, actually, it's the traditional media over 40 years that has had a much greater impact on people'sattitudes</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCTWO-680b588e000444188fe6b4b4098f0ba9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCTWO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-DWS1-DY08-322R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402047</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

They've been out and about kicking lumps out of the neighbours whose reported the row between Boris Johnson and his girlfriend over the weekend, we had Jacob Rees-Mogg describing them as Corbynista curtain twitchers, the best in the Guardian for publishing the story, saying they should be ashamed. Others have described the couple as snoopers and part of a get Boris campaign, this was the view of the former International Development Secretary Priti Patel he was out and about this morning to speak in Boris Johnson's behalf. I think it's fair to say the initial report that was taken to the Guardian newspaper was politically motivated by people, I mean, the very prospect of someone taping someone in their private home, quite frankly, tells me that that is politically motivated and that is not the type of behaviour you would expect in our country, you would associate it with the old Eastern Bloc. </p><p>So tell me that is not politically motivated. Let's turn our attention to another story, John Prescott, the former Deputy Prime Minister, has suffered a stroke. What can you tell us? John Prescott has suffered a stroke on Friday and has been admitted to the whole Royal Infirmary, he is in the Andean stroke department. -- the Hull infirmary. We don't have any sort of information about what condition he's in, just the family say what sort of tremendous treatment they received from the staff at the hospital. John Prescott was 81 but you'd still see him out and about at Westminster, though he is to pull back from front line politics, he is still politically engaged as it were. And he sort of become quite a prominent Jeremy Corbyn supporters which has put him slightly at odds with those who came from the same sort of political area as him, namely the new Labour, Tony Blair political supporters, because they have the come mist Corbyn's keenest critics. John Prescott has not, he been notable in standing up for mist Corbyn. So he has still been politically engaged although he has not been involved in the cutting edge of politics but he has been admitted to hospital now and we will have to wait and see what reports we get from the medical stuff about his condition. Thank you. Facebook's head of global affairs, the former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, has told the BBC that the social media platform is in favour of new industry rules and regulation. Speaking to the Today Programme, Mr Clegg said he wants to create an 'oversight board', with the power to make independent rulings on whether questionable content should be removed from the site. And he said there was no evidence that Facebook affected the result of the EU referendum. These companies are huge and affect every aspect of our lives, our social lives, business lines, everyday lives, a third of the world's populations uses one or other of Facebook's menu of products, WhatsApp and Instagram and so on. Nonetheless it has all happened in such a short period of time I think we are somewhat breathlessly trying to catch up with the pace of growth and put guardrails in place, rules in place, and it's not for private companies, however big or small, to come up with those rules. It is for democratic politicians and the democratic world to do so on privacy, on how elections are conducted, on hateful content, all those things. Let's talk about the principle, first of all. The cynics might say, here is Nick Clegg, effectively a PR man for Mark Zuckerberg, he's had a lot of flak, saying, look this is your problem, not our problem. If you're worried about these things, you do something about it, don't ask us to do something. I'm not just providing a PR gloss, in my new job I am responsible for how these policies are set and they're very substantive on how to tackle terrorist content online, how to protect elections from outside interference and so on. But you are accepting... To some, it will sound as if you're saying, don't blame us, nothing we can do, if you think there's a problem you go and sort it out. I don't think it's an issue of blame, I think it is right that companies like Facebook acknowledge the mistakes that they have made. And of course mistakes have been made. It is just that I don't think that it is in any way conceivable, and more than that, I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC2WA-ebca92167b4747a58c49b251f1de4c1f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC2WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-KDH1-JBH6-C3K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Amol Rajan, BBC News. </p><p>Rob Jones is Director of threat leadership at the National Crime Agency, and joins me now. Thank you for coming in to speak to us. First things first. Do people realise that they are breaking the law on line? Absolutely. People who post Child abuse images are clear that they are breaking the line, and this makes it very clear what is illegal and other harms that aren't illegal. So what do you make of the white paper? We welcome the white paper. To give you an idea of the scale of the threat that we face, back in 2004 we were seeing about 110,000 reports of images of child abuse from the National Centre for missing and exploited children. By the time we get to 2018, those figures have gone up to 18 million, so the explosion in volume has demanded a response from law enforcement. That response has been us trying to arrest as many suspects as we can, and trying to safeguard victims. The third element that has been missing is treating the environment where that offending takes place, and this white paper gives us an opportunity to do that. So what have the challenges been to you in terms of getting a prosecution when you know that there is a crime that has been committed online? How easy has it been to work with the platform of the Internet and social media? We do some great work with social media companies and technology providers, and they support us with prosecutions. The difference that we see is to move from a reactive stance where crimes happen and are reported to us after the event to a position where industry is proactive and prevents offending in the first place. That means preventing access to images and defining success is preventing access rather than reporting that crimes have taken place and the law enforcement investigating and the re-victimisation of children. You are sounding as this it is a very positive move, which it is, but because of your experience of working online and prosecuting online, do you envisage any problems with the white paper in the form that it is right now? What more needs to be done? We have a 12 week consultation period, and that can be used to work in partnership with industry and technology companies to make sure that this white paper leads to very effective legislation. These two vital things it creates, one is the concept of a duty of care, and the second is a regulator. That basic principle that there is a duty of care for those who run platforms is really important, and we expect companies to create safety by design, by ensuring that their platforms can't be exploited by paedophiles and criminals before they come to market, not after. Rob Jones at the National Crime Agency, it has been fascinating, thank you very much indeed. Thank you. We have got more stories coming out of Newsroom Live hit at the BBC news. But for now we say goodbye to viewers on BBC Two. The headlines on BBC News: Theresa May will meet French president Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel tomorrow for talks five days before the UK is due to leave the EU without a deal. New online regulations mean tech companies could be fined or blocked if they fail to protect children. Campaigners say the plans would make Britain a world pioneer. A new pollution charge comes into force in Central London to tackle the capital's toxic air. Sport now, here's Azi Farni. Thank you. After Watford's stunning win over Wolves in the FA Cup semifinal yesterday, goalkeeper Ben Foster said he would refuse to play in the final against Manchester City. He is Watford's number one keeper, but it is veteran Mario Gomez who has played in every FA Cup match so far this season, including yesterday's dramatic 3- to extra time win, where Gerard Ellis AO -- Deulofeu scored the winner. Gomez is respected to expected to retire at the end of the season. It is about the team. He understands the game, and if I'm not there, we are well</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-791e2e7fae8f43f88f6c80bee4b33eb0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV4-V8C1-JBH6-C4R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We welcome the white paper. To give you an idea of the scale of the threat that we face, back in 2004 we were seeing about 110,000 reports of images of child abuse from the National Centre for missing and exploited children.

The difference that we see is to move from a reactive stance where crimes happen and are reported to us after the event to a position where industry is proactive and prevents offending in the first place. That means preventing access to images and defining success is preventing access rather than reporting that crimes have taken place and the law enforcement investigating and the re-victimisation of children.
