Continue reading Amazon s white-collar workers are starting to stand up for their blue-collar colleagues</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In November 2018, more than 20,000 Googlers briefly walked off their jobs to protest the company s lax treatment of executives who sexually harassed their subordinates. At the time, there was some debate about whether the protest was a singular event that came in response to some particularly outrageous behavior, or whether it portended the rise of a new tech labor movement. Two years later, after prominent actions by tech company employees related to their employers  policies on climate change and government contracts, it seems clear that it was the latter   and that the movement has accelerated along with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>One place where this has been true is Amazon, where employees working in warehouse and delivery jobs face some of the most dangerous working conditions of any tech giant at the moment. This was true even before the coronavirus began to spread around the world, but it s particularly true now. Amazon employees have gotten sick, died, and been fired after complaining about working conditions. On Thursday the company announced its largest outbreak to date, with more than 30 workers contracting the disease at a warehouse in New Jersey.</p><p>Amazon denies retaliating against organizing workers, and has implemented measures intended to reduce the risk of workers getting sick during the pandemic. But those efforts have not satisfied some members of its own white-collar workforce, who have begun to organize on behalf of their blue-collar colleagues. Those efforts took the form of a digital calendar invitation, the calendar invitation disappeared, and now we have a caper on our hands. Shirin Ghaffary has the story at Recode:</p><p>Several of Amazon s corporate employees are urging thousands of their colleagues to defy their employer by taking this Friday off work en masse to instead gather virtually and discuss how to push for more rights for the company s warehouse workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, several Amazon employees have told Recode that invitations to the virtual event have mysteriously disappeared from their calendars and inboxes.</p><p>Workers told Recode they believe Amazon s management deleted the event in an attempt to quash a growing collaboration between corporate and warehouse-level employees over workers  labor rights and environmental concerns.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment when asked if it had deleted the event.</p><p>As Ghaffary notes, the missing meeting is likely to escalate tensions at the company, where leaked emails from earlier this month already showed mounting dissension over the company s treatment of labor issues in its workforce.</p><p>As chaos roiled Amazon over the past weeks, I ve often wondered where Jeff Bezos has been in all this. The CEO has largely avoided working on the day-to-day operations of the company for years, according to a 2018 interview with Forbes. As Karen Weise reports in a revealing piece in the New York Times, COVID-19 has drawn him back in   but only gradually, and with little direct communication to the outside world.</p><p>On one hand, I m not going to argue that there s a single,  right  way the CEO of a tech giant should be spending their time at the moment. All of them have wrenching, conflicting demands on their day, and deciding what to delegate and what to do yourself is a minefield for anyone in a leadership role.</p><p>On the other, it has been clear for more than a month now that Amazon s most acute crisis is in its warehouses   and the CEO s belated attention to that crisis has had measurable effects. This anecdote from Weise s story will stay with me for a long time:</p><p>On April 8, when the virus had spread to more than 50 Amazon facilities, Mr. Bezos made a surprise visit to a Whole Foods store and an Amazon warehouse, both near Dallas, which the company filmed. Afterward, he asked other executives why masks, which the company had finally obtained, weren t being required, according to a person involved in the response.</p><p>A few days later, Amazon told its warehouse workers that they had to wear masks.</p><p>Something for Amazon s white-collar workers to discuss on Friday, assuming their employer doesn t find a new way to thwart them from getting together.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Urgency</emphasis></h><p>Jay Rosen is one of America s foremost press critics, and last week he proposed some great ideas for improving coverage of COVID-19. One of them was the creation of what he calls an  urgency index    a dynamic, publicly available list of the most urgent problems a publication covers.

How are tech companies using this period to consolidate their power and eliminate competitors?</p><p>Elections. What role are technology companies playing to protect the integrity of our elections during the pandemic?</p><p>Innovation. What is Silicon Valley inventing in an effort to end the pandemic or improve our quality of life during it?</p><p>That s our current top 10.

At the time, there was some debate about whether the protest was a singular event that came in response to some particularly outrageous behavior, or whether it portended the rise of a new tech labor movement. Two years later, after prominent actions by tech company employees related to their employers' policies on climate change and government contracts, it seems clear that it was the latter - and that the movement has accelerated along with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><br/>One place where this has been true is Amazon, where employees working in warehouse and delivery jobs face some of the most dangerous working conditions of any tech giant at the moment. This was true even before the coronavirus began to spread around the world, but it's particularly true now. Amazon employees have gotten sick, died, and been fired after complaining about working conditions. On Thursday the company announced its largest outbreak to date, with more than 30 workers contracting the disease at a warehouse in New Jersey.<br/>Amazon denies retaliating against organizing workers, and has implemented measures intended to reduce the risk of workers getting sick during the pandemic. But those efforts have not satisfied some members of its own white-collar workforce, who have begun to organize on behalf of their blue-collar colleagues. Those efforts took the form of a digital calendar invitation, the calendar invitation disappeared, and now we have a caper on our hands. Shirin Ghaffary has the story at Recode:<br/>Several of Amazon's corporate employees are urging thousands of their colleagues to defy their employer by taking this Friday off work en masse to instead gather virtually and discuss how to push for more rights for the company's warehouse workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, several Amazon employees have told Recode that invitations to the virtual event have mysteriously disappeared from their calendars and inboxes.<br/>Workers told Recode they believe Amazon's management deleted the event in an attempt to quash a growing collaboration between corporate and warehouse-level employees over workers' labor rights and environmental concerns.<br/>Amazon declined to comment when asked if it had deleted the event.<br/>As Ghaffary notes, the missing meeting is likely to escalate tensions at the company, where leaked emails from earlier this month already showed mounting dissension over the company's treatment of labor issues in its workforce.<br/>As chaos roiled Amazon over the past weeks, I've often wondered where Jeff Bezos has been in all this. The CEO has largely avoided working on the day-to-day operations of the company for years, according to a 2018 interview with Forbes. As Karen Weise reports in a revealing piece in the New York Times, COVID-19 has drawn him back in - but only gradually, and with little direct communication to the outside world.<br/>On one hand, I'm not going to argue that there's a single, \"right\" way the CEO of a tech giant should be spending their time at the moment. All of them have wrenching, conflicting demands on their day, and deciding what to delegate and what to do yourself is a minefield for anyone in a leadership role.<br/>On the other, it has been clear for more than a month now that Amazon's most acute crisis is in its warehouses - and the CEO's belated attention to that crisis has had measurable effects. This anecdote from Weise's story will stay with me for a long time:<br/>On April 8, when the virus had spread to more than 50 Amazon facilities, Mr. Bezos made a surprise visit to a Whole Foods store and an Amazon warehouse, both near Dallas, which the company filmed. Afterward, he asked other executives why masks, which the company had finally obtained, weren't being required, according to a person involved in the response.<br/>A few days later, Amazon told its warehouse workers that they had to wear masks.<br/>Something for Amazon's white-collar workers to discuss on Friday, assuming their employer doesn't find a new way to thwart them from getting together.<br/>Update, 6:01 p.m.: Amazon sent the following statement. It also said that it does not fire workers for protesting working conditions or for organizing.<br/>Our employees are heroes fighting for their communities and helping people get critical items they need in this crisis-we have nearly 500,000 people in the U.S. alone supporting customers and we are taking measures to support each one. We've implemented a broad suite of new benefits changes for employees in our operations and logistics network including an additional $2 per hour, 2x base pay for overtime, and paid time off benefits for regular part-time and seasonal employees. We are encouraging those who are unwell to stay home and taking extreme measures to keep people safe in our buildings. Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we are evaluating and making changes in real-time and encourage anyone to compare our overall pay, benefits, and speed in which we're managing this crisis to other retailers and major employers across the country.<br/>UrgencyJay Rosen is one of America's foremost press critics, and last week he proposed some great ideas for improving coverage of COVID-19. One of them was the creation of what he calls an \"urgency index\" - a dynamic, publicly available list of the most urgent problems a publication covers. He writes:<br/>Think of it as an answer to the question, \"what in the public realm should I be most worried about?\" Or, \"what do we need to be monitoring to stay reasonably well informed during this crisis?\"<br/>During an alarming time, the question of how to apportion your worries has never felt more relevant. And as a reader, we think you ought to know what your journalists are most worried about.<br/>Last year, we published a public guide to The Interface that includes a list of the questions related to technology and democracy that we track most closely. The idea has always been to update that list as our coverage priorities change, and it's now clear that the most consequential intersection of tech and democracy this year will come in how Silicon Valley responds to the pandemic.<br/>That doesn't mean we're changing our focus entirely - we're still deeply interested in stories about privacy regulation, competition, and the role tech giants will play in the 2020 election. But over the past several weeks it has become clear how all of those stories are now, at least in part, pandemic stories. And a guide to what we cover ought to reflect that.<br/>So: we're going to build an urgency index, and we'd like to get your feedback. Here's our initial effort to catalog the most urgent problems in the pandemic response as it relates to our coverage here at The Interface.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Testing.

(Jay Peters / The Verge)<br/>Pandemic\u2b50The first version of Apple and Google's cross-platform contact tracing API should be available to developers as of next week. It's the first phase of a two-part plan to roll out the system, reports TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington:<br/>The second part of the plan is issuing a system update to build in contact tracing at the OS level. Opt-in would be managed on the device, and both Android and iOS smartphones with this toggle enabled would automatically be able to participate in local contact tracing efforts - whether or not they had any specific health agency apps installed. Apple and Google clarified in a follow-up Q&amp;A session about the system that users would still be prompted to download and install a public health app from their local authority should their phone notify them of a possible contact, so that they could get additional info about next steps from a trusted source.<br/>The coronavirus crisis isn't over in Georgia, but Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has decided it's time to start reopening parts of the economy there anyway. Tomorrow, gyms, hair salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys, and nail salons will be allowed to resume some operations. On Monday, theaters, social clubs, and restaurant dine-in services will be able to start back up as well. The situation is forcing people to choose between their health and their job.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1095581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-16V1-DYDW-7512-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001948</classCode><className>LABOR &amp;

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at this past week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  So Prime Day rolled round, and chances are you bought a Kindle or an electric toothbrush or whatever because, well: cheap!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I say ''chances are'' because Amazon sold over 175 million products globally during the two-day event this year -- more than 2018's Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. I don't know what's more impressive: that Amazon created a huge shopping holiday in five years, or that it keeps up with the demand.</p><p>  I mean, how does it meet demand? Well, as The Washington Post reported:</p><p>  As a ''rebinner'' at an Amazon fulfillment center outside Minneapolis, Meg Brady says she is expected to handle 600 items per hour, constantly pivoting on her feet to grab one item and place it in a nearby chute. Brady, 55, compared the job to an aerobics workout.</p><p>  Ms. Brady was among a hundred or so workers, according to some media outlets, at the Shakopee, Minn., facility who went on strike during Prime Day. Amazon says it believes that about 15 of its associates participated in the event.</p><p>  Fellow pickets at Shakopee held a placard, stating: ''We're human, not robots.'' Among their complaints about workplace conditions was that they feel overwhelmed by the rate of work required to keep up with the automated systems.</p><p>  ''Clearly there's concern over the intensity of work, and whether technology has intensified the work,'' said Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in technology and employment.</p><p>  People also view robots as a threat to their jobs: In a 2017 Pew Research Center survey, 58 percent of the respondents said they thought there should be limits on the number of jobs that companies could replace with machines.</p><p>  In reality, jobs aren't automated. Tasks are. That means that working with robots, rather than being replaced by them, is likely to become the norm for many people as companies like Amazon automate to increase productivity and profits.</p><p>  That the trend is already troubling Amazon employees is a problem for the company, though.</p><p>  ''The biggest barrier to getting technology rolled out is the organizational resistance to adoption,'' said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''So companies need a strategy not only for how to get it to work, but also how to get the work force behind getting it rolled out.''</p><p>  That provides another way to think about Amazon's recent commitment to spend $700 million on a retaining program for a third of its work force in the United States. That's a push to make its work force fit for a technologized future, and one no doubt encouraged by the tight labor market.</p><p>  But it can also be viewed as a way to coax workers into supporting the deployment of more technology. Robots increase productivity and hence profits, and retraining gives employees a clearer view to taking a larger slice of the growing pie.</p><p>  Whether that will appease the workers in Shakopee remains to be seen.</p><p>  Antitrust, in the House</p><p>  Big Tech got an earful about is market power in Washington during the week, but that got us little closer to changing things.</p><p>  Lawmakers from the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee grilled Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google on Tuesday. Representative Joe Neguse, Democrat of Colorado, didn't mess around, pointing out that Facebook controls four of the world's six largest social networks (itself, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp).</p><p>  ''We have a word for that,'' he said. ''It is called monopoly.''</p><p>  Criticism ran the gamut -- from dual roles as seller and platform (hello, Apple and Amazon) to search dominance (howdy, Google) -- and came from both parties. Still, not every lawmaker was on the offense: Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said that ''just because a business is big doesn't mean that it is bad.''</p><p>  What to make of it? ''There's clearly political interest in this whole area,'' said Harry First, an antitrust law professor at New York University.</p><p>  But, Mr. First added, ''substantive things don't usually come out of these hearings,'' and that seemed particularly the case here, where there was so little agreement on the best route forward.</p><p>  Mr. First invoked a lyric from Buffalo Springfield's 1966 song ''For What It's Worth'' to describe the situation: ''There's something happening here. What it is ain't exactly clear.''</p><p>  Can Libra survive?</p><p>  President Trump. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The Fed chair, Jay Powell. The International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Gita Gopinath. The Securities and Exchange Commission. Central bankers from Britain, China, France, Singapore and beyond.</p><p>  That's just a handful of the influential critics of Facebook's new cryptocurrency project, Libra. And joining them this past week were lawmakers, as David Marcus, who leads Facebook crypto initiative, sat through more than six hours of hearings before the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees.</p><p>  Concerns were numerous. ''Facebook's plans raise serious privacy, trading and monetary policy concerns,'' said Representative Maxine Waters of California, the House committee's Democratic chairwoman. She added that Libra could ''yield immense economic power that could destabilize government.''</p><p>  But the common thread was a deep-seated mistrust of Facebook. Or, as Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, put it:</p><p>  ''Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience. We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people's bank accounts, and to use powerful tools they don't understand, like monetary policy.''</p><p>  Ouch. Everyone loves a challenge, but this seems overwhelming.</p><p>  Mr. Marcus said during the hearings that Facebook was ''owning'' its mistakes and ''working to remedy them.'' And he insisted that the company wouldn't launch Libra until regulators' concerns were addressed.</p><p>  But what will that take? With so many critics, there's a risk that Libra may require a fundamental redesign, said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group.</p><p>  ''I don't know whether they will want to move ahead with something like that,'' he said.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Peter Thiel called Google's China work ''seemingly treasonous.'' Google denied it; Mr. Trump said his administration would ''take a look.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 We got a peek at Elon Musk's plan to wire up your brain. The project uses tiny threads that could one day connect your neurons directly to the internet.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Facebook faces a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission for mishandling user data. Many argued that the punishment wouldn't go far enough.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The European Union is chasing Amazon over antitrust issues. It has opened a formal investigation into the company's dual role as seller and platform.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 5G isn't a health hazard. One scientist's inaccurate chart has led to unwarranted fears about wireless technology.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Netflix lost subscribers in the United States for the first time in 12 years, after it raised prices several months ago.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 A third city banned facial recognition for use by the local government and law enforcement. Oakland, Calif., joined San Francisco and Somerville, Mass.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Some senators want to keep Huawei banned. New legislation seeks to stop the Trump administration from relaxing pressure on the company.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Google and Facebook are tracking you on sex websites. Because, of course they are.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 When is a photo app a national security threat? When it's developed in Russia, according to critics of FaceApp. Security researchers said the claims were overblown.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Most of the Googlers who organized walkouts have now left. Four of seven of them have resigned since orchestrating protests over the company's handling of sexual harassment claims.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Alan Turing is the new face of Britain's 50-pound Note. The pioneering computer scientist's huge achievements in code breaking during World War II were overshadowed at the time by a conviction under Britain's Victorian laws against homosexuality.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

In his prepared testimony, Bezos had said, \"Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than 4% of retail in the US\", characterising retail as everything - including restaurants, bars, gas stations, Neguse pointed out. At the Big Tech CEOs' hearing before the House subcommittee on antitrust on July 29 (available to watch here), multiple revelations were put on the record about Amazon and its anti-competitive practices.</p><p>As both the marketplace and a seller, Amazon is in fundamental conflict of interest: \"Isn't it an inherent conflict of interest for Amazon to produce and sell products on its platform that compete directly with third party sellers, particularly when you, Amazon, sets the rules of the game?\" Cicilline asked Bezos. Amazon, as a data company, has a huge advantage over third party sellers, Cicilline said. This is precisely the argument that AIOVA and CAIT have been making against Flipkart and Amazon in India. The European Union was to file formal antitrust charges against Amazon in June due to its treatment of third-party sellers due to its dual role as a marketplace operator and a seller of its own products.</p><p>* Amazon is a gatekeeper to content and producer of content: Representative Jamin Raskin (D-MD), citing the WarnerMedia-Amazon Prime Video deal over HBO Max app - which is still under negotiation and whose details Bezos did not know -, said that Amazon was asking for more content from WarnerMedia and exploiting its position as the \"gatekeeper\" in the streaming device market to undermine a competitor in the content market. Raskin argued that Amazon was \"essentially converting power in one domain into power in another domain where it doesn't belong\".</p><p>It is significant that a 40% market share would send alarm bells ringing in the US and force the dominant player to attempt to mischaracterise the facts. In India, on the other hand, when All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) contested Competition Commission of India's clean chit to Flipkart in the National Company Law Apellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and said that Flipkart would account for 40% of the market share, the judge refused to accept it, and instead asked AIOVA to prove \"abuse\" before dominance.</p><p>Third party sellers only effective choice is Amazon but Amazon treats them as competitors: David Cicilline (D-RI), the chair of the subcommittee, said that Amazon controls 75% of all online marketplace sales and its market share is seven times the market share of its closest competitor. Of the 2.2 million active sellers on Amazon (as on July 28, 2020), Amazon is the sole source of income for 37% of them. Cicilline cited internal Amazon's documents wherein these sellers were described as \"competitors\".</p><p>\"The evidence we've collected shows that Amazon is only interested in exploiting its monopoly power over the e-commerce marketplace to further expand and protect this power. This investigation makes clear that Amazon's due role as a platform operator and competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti- competitive, and Congress must take action.\" - Chairperson David Cicilline (D-RI)</p><p>Amazon uses data from third party sellers, potential investees, and AWS clients to build competing products</p><p>1. Amazon's policies on accessing third party sellers' data have been violated: In a major concession, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos told the House Judiciary's subcommittee on _____ that although Amazon has a policy against using [not accessing] seller-specific data to aid its private label business, he \"cannot guarantee that that policy has never been violated\".</p><p>Third party sellers only effective choice is Amazon but Amazon treats them as competitors: David Cicilline (D-RI), the chair of the subcommittee, said that Amazon controls 75% of all online marketplace sales and its market share is seven times the market share of its closest competitor.

Amazon's policies on accessing third party sellers' data have been violated: In a major concession, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos told the House Judiciary's subcommittee on _____ that although Amazon has a policy against using [not accessing] seller-specific data to aid its private label business, he \"cannot guarantee that that policy has never been violated\".<br/><br/>2. Amazon uses aggregate data from third party sellers to build its own competing, private label products: US Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) cited a Wall Street Journal article that reported that Amazon has detailed access to aggregate data of third party sellers, even if there are only one or two sellers of the product. Jayapal reminded Bezos that in July 2019, Amazon's Associate General Counsel (Litigation and Regulatory) Nathan Sutton had testified before the same subcommittee on antitrust that Amazom does not \"use individual seller data to directly compete with them\".<br/><br/>* Amazon's rules allow employees to access aggregate data even when there are only one or two sellers of a product: Jayapal's further questioning revealed through this aggregate data, Amazon employees have access to \"highly detailed data\". This aggregate data could relate to only a couple of sellers as well, thereby defeating the entire point of aggregating it, questioning by Representative Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) revealed. This is an important factor for India's committee of experts on non-personal data to keep in mind.<br/><br/>* On prompting by Armstrong, Bezos committed to sharing the results of the internal inquiry about this with the subcommittee.<br/><br/>* In India, while the chairperson of NLCAT recognised that Flipkart Flipkart earns by selling data, customer likes and dislikes to earn money, he refused to buy the concept of \"preferred sellers\" and classified Flipkart's private label products as \"third party\" products.<br/><br/>* Case in point - Fortem, a company that sells car trunk organisers and had no competitors except Amazon Warehouse Deals that had sold only 17 units. An Amazon employee accessed the aggregate data, figured out how much they invest on promotion, and helped Amazon launch a competing product in October 2019.<br/><br/>3. Amazon used its venture capital fund to use start-ups' data to launch its own services: Neguse and Representative Ken Buck (R-CO) cited another Wall Street Journal article that reported how Amazon used its venture capital fund - Alexa Fund - to gain access to start-ups' finances and other confidential information to then launch almost identical products/services later which consequently lead to \"disastrous results results for the original start-up company\".<br/><br/>* For instance, Amazon asked Vocalife, a start-up with speech detection technology, for a meeting, got insight into its proprietary data, and then stopped all communication with the company - without investing -, but the technology was used in Amazon's Echo device. Bezos claimed ignorance about the specifics.<br/><br/>4. Amazon uses confidential information gained via AWS to build competing services: Neguse said that Amazon had used its cloud service providing arm, Amazon Web Services, to identify best technologies and roll out replica product and services. According to him, a former Amazon engineer had posted online that he and his team \"proactively identified growing businesses on AWS\", built competing products, and then targeted those products to the business's customers. Bezos did not say that AWS did not use the data it got access to by servicing its clients; he just said that AWS didn't stop servicing their competitors.<br/><br/>* \"I think there may be categories. I know some databases of different kinds and so on where we see that it's an important product for customers and we make our own product offering in that arena. But it doesn't mean we stopped servicing the other companies that are also making those products. We have competitors using AWS and we work very hard to make them successful. Netflix is one example. Hulu is another, and so on.\" - Jeff Bezos<br/><br/>* Start-ups fear IPR theft and first-mover advantage of Big Tech: Neguse pointed out that start-ups are extremely dependent on Big Tech but fear them stealing their core ideas by exploiting their existing dominance in the market.<br/><br/>Amazon's MO with sellers: predatory pricing, coerce into buying promotional plans<br/><br/>5. Amazon engages in predatory pricing to obliterate competing sellers: Cicilline and House Representative Mary Scanlon (D-NY) cited two cases where Amazon launched competing products at massively slashed prices, causing the sales of a third party seller to drop to zero overnight in one case, and to significantly reduce in another.<br/><br/>* Amazon obliterated Quidsi-owned Diapers.com by first slashing Amazon's own diaper prices to undercut Diapers.com's, and then buying it once it started to struggle. Amazon's profit-and-loss statements from 2010, that Scanlon cited, showed that Amazon was \"willing to bleed\" over $200 million in losses over diapers. After Amazon bought Diapers.com, it cut promotions like Amazon.mom and increased prices of diapers. Bezos initially claimed amnesia since it happened 10-11 years ago, but then said that diapers are a very large product category. Scanlon pinned him with one remark, \"But this was the online diaper market.\" Amazon ultimately shut down Quidsi in 2017, citing profitability issues. Cicilline too cited a case where<br/><br/>* In India too, sellers have long claimed that Flipkart (and potentially Amazon) engage in predatory pricing to the benefit of their own \"preferred sellers\" and private label products.<br/><br/>Interested readers may consider reading Brad Stone's 2013 book The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon that gives more details about the Amazon-Quidsi incident. As per that account, Amazon actively manipulated its own diaper prices to keep undercutting Diapers.com's.<br/><br/>6. Amazon favours sellers whose opt for Fulfilment by Amazon and Buy Box services: In response to questioning by Scanlon, Bezos said that \"effectively\", the Buy Box (sellers who get the \"Buy Now\" button on their product page) favours whose products are available on Prime. Despite asking, Bezos did not clarify if Buy Box's algorithm favoured third party sellers who bought Fulfilled by Amazon services over those who did not.<br/><br/>7. Amazon lists counterfeit products above original products to coerce sellers into signing marketing deals with Amazon: Buck and Representative Henry C. Johnson (D-GA) both cited the case of PopSockets wherein Amazon listed counterfeit products over PopSockets' original products and did not remedy the situation until PopSockets agreed to a $2 million marketing deal with Amazon. Bezos called such a practice \"unacceptable\", said that Amazon has a counterfeit crimes unit, and encouraged \"this body to pass stricter penalties for counterfeiters, and to increase law enforcement resources to go after counterfeiters\" as they are \"bad actors\". Indulging in a bit of grandstanding, Bezos called counterfeit products \"a scourge\" but fumbled when Johnson asked him why Amazon is not responsible for keeping all counterfeit products off its marketplace.<br/><br/>8. Alexa might have been trained to recommend Amazon products and services by default: In response to questions by Raskin who cited a New York Times article that said that Alexa recommended AmazonBasics products, Bezos conceded that he didn't know if Alexa had been trained that way he wouldn't be surprised if Alexa \"sometimes does promote our own products\".<br/><br/>9. Amazon prioritised its own non-essential products over other companies' during the pandemic: Scanlon pointed out that although Amazon had announced in March 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, that it would delay the shipment of non-essential products, the policy was selectively applied as \"Amazon appeared to continue to designate its own products as essential, even as it delayed competing products from third party sellers\". Bezos simply said that since there was no playbook for the pandemic, despite Amazon's goal to deliver only essential supplies, \"I'm sure we did not do that perfectly\". While Amazon's Ring doorbell continued to be delivered without delay, Bezos wasn't sure if the same was true for Ring's rivals. He, however, did say that the company did not focus on profitability while designating products as essential or not.</p><p>Bezos on using slave labour, social media<br/><br/>Despite Bezos promise to the contrary, Amazon uses slave labour: In response to Buck's question that none of the platforms would tolerate slave labour \"in manufacturing your products or in products that are sold on your platforms\", Bezos agreed \"completely\" but no one held him to account for Amazon's dismal labour practices in its own warehouses.<br/><br/>Social media is a \"nuanced destruction machine\" according to Bezos: In response to Representative Jim Jordan's (R-OH) question whether \"cancel culture mob\" was \"dangerous\", Bezos said, \"I am concerned in general about that and what I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that this social media is a nuanced destruction machine. And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy\" and agreed with the Bari Weiss's characterisation of social media as a \"digital thunderdome\". <br/><br/>Bezos has a bad memory, and doesn't know a lot of things.<br/><br/>Bezos couldn't decide if counterfeit goods are sold on Amazon or not. In response to a question by Representative Lucy McBath (D-GA) about whether counterfeit goods are sold on Amazon, he eventually said \"I guess so\". But in response to Representative Gregory Steube (R-FL) question on whether the Chinese government steals technology from US companies, he said, \"Certainly there are knockoff products, if that's what you mean, and there are counterfeit products and all of that.\"<br/><br/>Bezos didn't know how sellers are verified before being allowed to sell on Amazon, or how big that verification team is: Bezos did not know about Amazon US' recent policy change that makes it mandatory for sellers to show their business names and addresses. To answer McBath's question about requiring phone numbers - which Bezos could not -, numbers are not required. Bezos similarly did not know that instead of an email address, the company advises sellers to rely on Amazon's Buyer-Seller Messaging system for electronic communication with customers to prevent spam and abuse. And this was already a requirement in Europe, Japan and Mexico.<br/><br/>* Bezos didn't know much about the impending deal between Amazon Prime Video and WarnerMedia about provision of HBO Max app on Fire devices.<br/><br/>* He did not know how Twitch operates, and that it doesn't license music.<br/><br/>* He did not know why the shipment of Amazon's own devices, despite being non-essential, was not delayed during the pandemic like its competitors'?<br/><br/>* He didn't remember Gazelle Project that basically pressurised booksellers to give Amazon better financial deals.<br/><br/>During the first 90 minutes of the hearing, Bezos faced some technical issues with his audio feed which is why no question was addressed to him; it was fixed during the first recess. He also forgot to unmute himself once, suggesting that 2020 may have caught up with the richest human on the planet.</p><p>Documents cited by respresentatives:</p><p>Documents from the Hearing on \"Online Platforms and Market Power: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google\"</p><p>- House Judiciary Dems (@HouseJudiciary) July 29, 2020</p><p>Documents from the Hearing on \"Online Platforms and Market Power: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google\"</p><p>- House Judiciary Dems (@HouseJudiciary) July 29, 2020</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0054036894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-RN91-DXMP-K0WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2738\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

The only problem? \u201cThis bike is not an Amazon product or related to Amazon Prime,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman wrote in a statement to  Bloomberg . \u201cEchelon does not have a formal partnership with Amazon. We are working with Echelon to clarify this in its communications, stop the sale of the product and change the product branding.\u201d   Echelon had released no comment on the matter at last check, although Bloomberg said the bike was no longer listed for sale on the Amazon Web site. And as of Wednesday (Sept. 23), the company\u2019s original press release announcing the bike was no longer available online, according to Bloomberg.   But the announcement of an alleged Amazon-affiliated bike had a notable effect on the market anyway, as Peloton stock fell as much as 6.7 percent early Tuesday on concern that the firm would face Amazon as a direct competitor. The stock has since recovered, but the \u201cnews\u201d clearly spooked Peloton investors.   \u201cOther than a few cosmetic changes, the $500 bike is almost identical to Echelon\u2019s $500 bike at Walmart.com, which has been available at Walmart.com since March and hasn\u2019t had any noticeable impact to Peloton\u2019s growth,\u201d KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Edward Yruma wrote in a note to investors, as per Bloomberg.   The concerns are perhaps explained by the incredible run of investment interest the connected-equipment space has generated in the past half-year as gyms shut down and many consumers turned their homes into personal havens of physical fitness.   The boom can be clearly seen among well-known names in the connected-fitness game like Peloton that have seen booming times in 2020 \u2014 soaring revenues and profits and (as the Echelon bike demonstrates) wide imitation. When Peloton released earnings recently, the connected-fitness firm sprinted past analyst expectations for both its latest quarter and full fiscal year.   Almost all of Peloton\u2019s KPIs saw triple-digit increases as its connected-fitness subscription base topped 1 million, with a churn rate below 1 percent. Subscription revenue to the company\u2019s app and at-home workout programs grew 99 percent year over year to $121.2 million in Peloton\u2019s fiscal Q4.   And perhaps more impressive than merely drawing users in, the app is also showing lots of successful engagement. The average Peloton owner logged 24.7 monthly workouts vs. 12 in the same period last year. Subscription-based members worked out 76.8 million times in Q4, up from 17.8 million in the same 2019 period.   \u201cDigital fitness is a highly competitive category, with higher churn and lower barriers to entry than our connected-fitness subscription and model,\u201d  CEO John Foley  said on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWhile we believe we have the best digital-fitness experience with the broadest and deepest assortment of high-quality programming. We continue to focus on digital as an acquisition channel and added value for our connected-fitness subscriptions, and we\u2019re excited to say that digital is emerging as our fastest growing lead generation channel.\u201d   But Peloton\u2019s belief in its superiority aside, the segment is an ever more competitive space, with multiple players offering different variations on what Pelton does.   For instance, rival connected-fitness firm Tonal sells a roughly $3,000 wall-mounted system that simulates weights and uses artificial intelligence to guide users through training regimens. The company recently raised $120 million in a second round of venture-capital funding.   \"This new capital will allow us to accelerate our marketing initiatives while scaling our supply chain so that we can change even more people\u2019s lives through the power of strength training,\" Tonal CEO Aly Orady wrote in a  blog post . \"We\u2019ll also be rolling out innovative new software features and a wider breadth of workout categories that we are excited to share more on in the coming months.\"   Such investor interest in the sector comes as working out in person at the gym has seen consumer enthusiasm plummet to all-time lows due to COVID-19.  Gold\u2019s Gym ,  24-Hour Fitness ,  New York Sports Club's parent  and other chains have filed for Chapter 11 due to the pandemic.   Consumers seem mostly uninterested in rushing back to brick-and-mortar gyms, which has made the virtual fitness space all the more appealing \u2014 including to Big Tech players. For instance, Apple last week announced the launch of Apple Fitness+  to offer access to streaming studio workouts.   \u201cWe know Fitness+ will take working out with Apple Watch to the next level with unparalleled engagement, convenience, and inspiration,\u201d the company said.   And while Amazon isn\u2019t joining the race to dominate connected fitness with Echelon as a partner, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019d count the eCommerce giant out altogether. A less-expensive version of Peloton might not be Amazon\u2019s chosen path into the market, but might the company someday soon choose a real offering all its own? That seems plausible.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

STEWART</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&amp;T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While regulators and a federal judge ponder that question, the great disrupter -- Amazon -- is already raising prices. Last week, it said its Amazon Prime service, which includes its extensive video offerings along with free shipping and other benefits, would cost $119, a 20 percent increase from the current $99. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it's only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon's move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.</p><p>  As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there's no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&amp;T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner's content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren't direct competitors.</p><p>  While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).</p><p>  But Amazon is already vertically integrated -- it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).</p><p>  Which is why the so-called FANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflixand Google) loomed large at the just-completed AT&amp;T-Time Warner trial and may well figure in a Sprint-T-Mobile decision, even though none of the technology giants is directly involved or is a party to the litigation.</p><p>AT&amp;T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. ''The media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,'' he testified. ''It's coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.''</p><p>  The Time Warner chief executive, <person><nameText>Jeff Bewkes, </nameText></person>made the same argument. ''They have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,'' he said, adding that by ''they'' he meant the FANGs. ''And they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.''</p><p>  In closing arguments this week, AT&amp;T and Time Warner's lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.</p><p>  The government's lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: ''The fact that AT&amp;T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn't give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,'' he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)</p><p>AT&amp;T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as ''the wolves at the door,'' said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. ''That's the center of their theory.''</p><p>Time Warner's content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, ''are just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,'' he said.</p><p>  Of course, the argument can be made that AT&amp;T doesn't need to buy a company like Time Warner -- it could create a media content company of its own. That's what Amazon and Netflixdid, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.</p><p>  But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn't really matter. ''The major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,'' Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. ''In turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&amp;T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflixis -- would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?''</p><p>  Whether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&amp;T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest -- it could well influence Judge Richard Leon's decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.</p><p>  If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&amp;T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.</p><p>  Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.</p><p>  The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger -- a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>  The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services -- exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p><p>  So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn't harm consumers.</p><p>  The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn't have the power to raise prices.</p><p>  That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.</p><p>  Courts and antitrust regulators ''don't usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. ''Our crystal balls aren't that good. We don't have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.''</p><p>  While Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&amp;T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, ''this whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.''</p><p>  Perhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they're actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.</p><p>  Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration's antitrust policies, ''they may feel there's no reason not to roll the dice now,'' Mr. Hovenkamp said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A digital billboard for T-Mobile in Times Square.

So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&amp;T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While regulators and a federal judge ponder that question, the great disrupter \u2014 Amazon \u2014 is already raising prices. Last week <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/26/technology/business/amazon-prime-cost-increase/index.html\">it said its Amazon Prime service</url>, which includes its extensive video offerings along with free shipping and other benefits, would cost $119, a 20 percent increase from the current $99.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it\u2019s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon\u2019s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.</p><p>As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there\u2019s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&amp;T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner\u2019s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren\u2019t direct competitors.</p><p>While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).</p><p>But Amazon is already vertically integrated \u2014 it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).</p><p>Which is why the so-called FANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflixand Google) loomed large at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/att-time-warner-trial.html\">the just-completed AT&amp;T-Time Warner trial</url> and may well figure in a Sprint-T-Mobile decision, even though none of the technology giants is directly involved or is a party to the litigation.</p><p>AT&amp;T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201d</p><p>The Time Warner chief executive, <person><nameText>Jeff Bewkes, </nameText></person>made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201d</p><p>In closing arguments this week, AT&amp;T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.</p><p>The government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&amp;T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)</p><p>AT&amp;T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201d</p><p>Time Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.</p><p>Of course, the argument can be made that AT&amp;T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflixdid, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.</p><p>But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&amp;T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflixis \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201d</p><p>Whether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&amp;T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.</p><p>If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&amp;T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.</p><p>Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.</p><p>The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p><p>So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.</p><p>The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.</p><p>That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.</p><p>Courts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201d</p><p>While Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&amp;T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.</p><p>Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.</p><p>PHOTO: The proposed mergers of AT&amp;amp;T with Time Warner and T-Mobile with Sprint provoke the question: Will prices for consumers really rise?

Searching for the word \"suicide\" last week on Amazon's U.S. marketplace resulted in the webpage showing users to \"suicide kits\" and nooses. Results from its India website included sleeping pills, pesticides and a book entitled \"How To Commit Suicide.\" </p><p>Regulatory scrutiny of big tech companies is increasing with Amazon facing challenges in policing its sprawling marketplace, where merchants can massage the listings of banned or illegal goods so they go undetected. Amazon took down listings for the book and rope nooses after learning of them. The company prohibits merchants from selling non-media products that promote or glorify suicide, according to its website. A Wall Street Journal report last week also identified more than 4,000 items on Amazon that were deceptively labelled or that U.S. agencies had banned or deemed dangerous. Alphabet Inc's Google , Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have already been issuing helpline numbers in response to user queries involving the term \"suicide.\" While social media platforms have been scrutinized in recent months about how they moderate violent and potentially dangerous content, so far the debate has touched little on the world's top online retailer. Amazon said it encouraged customers who had concerns about an item to click the feedback box, located at the bottom of an item's detail page. The suicide helpline information will be added to detail pages of certain products, informing customers that free and confidential support is available through organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The message will be rolled out in the coming weeks for customers searching phrases related to suicide and will appear on relevant book product detail pages in the United States and United Kingdom from next week.

nitf:lede=\"true\"> September 04 -- Amazon.com Inc plans to promote helpline phone numbers to customers who query its site about suicide, the company told Reuters, after searches on its site suggested users search for nooses and other potentially harmful products.\u00a0Searching for the word \"suicide\" last week on Amazon's U.S. marketplace resulted in the webpage showing users to \"suicide kits\" and nooses.\u00a0Results from its India website included sleeping pills, pesticides and a book entitled \"How To Commit Suicide.\"\u00a0Regulatory scrutiny of big tech companies is increasing with Amazon facing challenges in policing its sprawling marketplace, where merchants can massage the listings of banned or illegal goods so they go undetected.\u00a0Amazon took down listings for the book and rope nooses after learning of them.\u00a0The company prohibits merchants from selling non-media products that promote or glorify suicide, according to its website.\u00a0A Wall Street Journal report last week also identified more than 4,000 items on Amazon that were deceptively labelled or that U.S. agencies had banned or deemed dangerous.\u00a0Alphabet Inc's Google , Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have already been issuing helpline numbers in response to user queries involving the term \"suicide.\"\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>While social media platforms have been scrutinized in recent months about how they moderate violent and potentially dangerous content, so far the debate has touched little on the world's top online retailer.\u00a0</p><p><br/>Amazon said it encouraged customers who had concerns about an item to click the feedback box, located at the bottom of an item's detail page.\u00a0<br/>The suicide helpline information will be added to detail pages of certain products, informing customers that free and confidential support is available through organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\u00a0<br/>The message will be rolled out in the coming weeks for customers searching phrases related to suicide and will appear on relevant book product detail pages in the United States and United Kingdom from next week.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

On Aug. 15, for example, when the Twitter account for the company's policy arm retweeted a post from Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., noting her \"great\" tour of Amazon's warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p><p> Blackburn has been a critic of big tech and chairs the new Senate Judiciary Committee's tech task force, which is looking at privacy, data security, censorship and antitrust. Her spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p> For years, Amazon's critics have chided the company for underpaying and overworking warehouse employees. In the U.S., it employs about 250,000 typically hourly workers, many who perform strenuous and  repetitive jobs like walking many miles a day, picking items off shelves or packing up boxes. In response, the online retail giant has launched a campaign to try to turn the tide  as regulators take a closer look at the company for potential abuses of its power.</p><p> The efforts, though, haven't seemed to tone down the political rhetoric aimed at the online retail giant.</p><p> (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)</p><p> The company unleashed a squad of warehouse workers, so-called \"FC Ambassadors,\" on Twitter roughly a year ago to refute the narrative of harsh working conditions. Some of the tweets have been ridiculed on social media.</p><p>Amazon also caught heat last year after a move to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour  included plans to take away some bonuses and stock grants for warehouse workers.</p><p> That move came shortly after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies Act, or Stop BEZOS Act, that would require large employers such as Amazon to pay the government for food stamps, public housing, Medicaid and other federal assistance received by their workers. The bill currently sits in the Senate Finance Committee.</p><p>Amazon has stepped up efforts to push back against its critics, including offering tours at 23 warehouses in the United States to let visitors see first-hand how its facilities operate.</p><p> The spate of warehouse visits hasn't toned down any of the opprobrium from Amazon's fiercest critics.  Sanders had said he would visit an Amazon fulfillment center. But in his ongoing sparring with the company, he has said he's \"not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse.\"</p><p>Amazon</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-34955122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW4-PKV1-DYFF-80KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 22, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000CEDV</classCode><className>TIDE ASA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS483114 COASTAL &amp;

It was Amazon video of its first drone delivery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the past several years, Amazon has been trying to deliver packages via drones. On Dec. 7, the company announced it had officially launched its program, known as Prime Air, in Cambridge, England. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a short video posted to its website, the company showed the track the drone used to launch, the drone's strenuous plod across a field, and the customer - a rotund, bespectacled man who had presumably decided it was too much trouble to go to the supermarket for a bag of sweet-and-salty popcorn. </p><p>The video announcer explained the proceedings with an air of earnest wonder, and a stamp on the footage helpfully added that we were watching \"actual flight footage not simulated.\" </p><p>In the mind of some marketing person, I'm sure the stamp was meant to impress viewers. But because the words are in all uppercase and framed by a stark white border, it looks like a threat. </p><p>Like a lot of Big Tech, Amazon doesn't seem to understand why anyone would eye its brave endeavors in innovation with skepticism. </p><p>The drone program faced years of public concern and regulatory hurdles; one of the reasons the launch took place in Britain was that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is - for now, at least - determined to maintain certain restrictions on the flight patterns and piloting of delivery drones.</p><p>Here's a shocker: Amazon is impatient with the FAA's hesitation. \"Amazon believes the current model of airspace management will not meet future ... demands, particularly highly-automated, low-altitude commercial operations,\" the company wrote in a July 2015 airspace proposal. It said that \"a paradigm shift in airspace management and operations is necessary.\"</p><p>Missing from all of this Brave New World discussion is the question of whether any of this is necessary. </p><p>Oh, I know it's necessary for Amazon - the company hates depending on shipping companies, like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, for its world-domination plans. Amazon needs drones because drones are crucial to consolidating its future control of the supply chain. The company doesn't register as a matter of particular interest the fact that the shipping supply chain is one of the few remaining industries where blue-collar Americans can still make an adequate living. </p><p>But if the last year of backlash elections around the world has made anything clear, it's the fact that there are plenty of citizens who do consider making an adequate living to be a matter of particular interest. In fact, they'd much rather have jobs than watch robots deliver bags of popcorn to their homes in 13 minutes, and they're desperate enough to vote for any snake-oil scheme that promises them the former instead of the latter. </p><p>When the pitchforks start showing up and they're not far away, I hope Big Tech rues spending so many years chasing \"innovations\" that decimated employment in exchange for the tiniest of gains in productivity, utility and human happiness. </p><p>Human happiness - yes, that warm, fuzzy, squishy beast was on my mind as I was watching the drone video. </p><p>Why, I asked myself, do I feel happier thinking about getting a delivery from a human being in a snazzy uniform, huge ring of keys rattling at her hip, than I feel about getting a delivery from a small, silent robot? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Could it be</emphasis>, readers, that there are reasons for shopping that go beyond the exchange of money for a physical good?</p><p>If you've ever had a pleasant interaction in a physical store with another customer or an employee, you already know the answer to this question. </p><p>If you've ever had a UPS driver or a Postal Service employee ask you how your day was going, you already know the answer to this question. </p><p>Outside of Amazon's shareholders, no one wants to live in a world where we are left alone with nothing but our packages. </p><p>The realization that we are a step closer to that reality upset me so much, I couldn't watch the delivery video all the way to the end. I hit pause at 1:53, stood up and stepped outside. </p><p>A brown UPS truck was parked across the street. I watched the driver step down from his seat, holding an armload of packages. Despite his burden, he lifted one hand to wave hello to me. I waved back at him. I kept waving, even after he'd entered the building across the street and could no longer see me.</p><p>\"I hope Big Tech rues spending so many years chasing  innovations  that decimated employment in exchange for the tiniest of gains. \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B61396150Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MG2-XDK1-DYRG-W12X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 24, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>US FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SHIPPING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Pilots</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njc5NTU5QUM5NkU4NEJEMzk3NTBCOThDODc0MDhBODU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc0QkUxRjIwOENFNDFFM0IyRjk2QzZCRjNCMjkwODU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N926120GM</classCode><className>AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

But that frenetic growth and ambition hasn't converted into Washington influence, something the company hopes to remedy with last week's hiring of former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Other technology heavyweights, from Google and Microsoft to Apple, have already boosted political spending as their ambition extends well beyond laptops and search results.</p><p> Big tech's big hope is that high-priced D.C. insiders like Carney can cut through regulatory hurdles that threaten to derail a host of ambitious plans. Taking on Carney, who served as <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spokesman from 2011 to 2014, puts Amazon just a call away from the most powerful lawmakers in the country. It's a sea-change for a company that's remained mostly quiet in Washington even as rivals have jumped into the lobbying frenzy. But Carney[2]'s hiring also puts an exclamation point on the idea that, if the cool kids in Silicon Valley really want to take over the world, first they need to make nice with Washington power brokers. Unlike Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other giants that have spent the last few years building up their public policy departments Amazon has mostly tried to go it alone, and without much success. Google has spent more on lobbying[3] than any other corporation since 2012. Part of the reason for that is the company's plan to develop driverless cars, which were forbidden on many California streets. Now, after a campaign that included giving politicians test rides and suggesting driverless cars as a remedy for drunk driving, Google won 25 permits[4] to test autonomous vehicles. There have also been reports that Google is developing its own drone program, a possible foray into the delivery strategy Amazon is eyeing. Facebook, led by founder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>has become an increasingly vocal part of the debate over immigration reform. More than 15-percent of the company's workers hold H-1B visas, which permit foreign workers to live inside the U.S. temporarily if they work in a specialist occupation. Other Facebook priorities include[5] protecting freedom of expression online, Internet security education, privacy legislation and online advertising laws. Playing Catch Up Amazon has been less conspicuous, and consistent, when it comes to public policy. First the company appeared indecisive on its support for the Marketplace Fairness Act[6], a bill that died in Congress before it would have forced e-commerce companies to collect sales tax from customers in each state where their products are sold. Amazon initially opposed the bill, pulling an about-face upon the realization that, with brick-and-mortar warehouses in states throughout the U.S., it would be on the hook to collect taxes anyway. Amazon decided it might as well advocate competitors like eBay being forced to pay taxes, too. Then the Federal Aviation Administration issued new rules that grounded the plan[7] to deliver packages by drone. More than a year after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company hopes to cut out the middle man and deliver its own packages, the FAA adopted regulations forcing drone pilots to operate their aircraft only within their line of sight. Now, as Amazon expands into everything from bigger delivery plans to movie production, it's certain to run into resistance from more than just technology rivals. 'Business doesn't like to be regulated but it loves to hire politicians,' said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. 'Amazon has a number of public policy issues they have to deal with and they're looking for people who can get them into a room to meet with powerful officials. They want someone who has a feel for Washington, and companies realize there's no one better for that than the people who have actually been there.' Today's tech giants are investing heavily outside their own roots in part because computers and software can now be found in virtually all consumer products - from toasters to automobiles. That makes almost everything a potential tech product. So it makes sense that, as lawmakers attempt to determine, say, how driverless cars will operate and whether delivery drones are legal, the companies that stand to profit off such ventures will want to influence policy from the inside. Amazon has known for years that it wants to do more than push Barnes and Noble[8] out of business. Between 2003 to 2014 it increased its lobby spending from $920,000 to $4.9 million, according to OpenSecrets.org[9]. Google has also known it wants to be more than a search engine, and has increased its schmooze spending from $80,000 to $16.83 million over the same period. Ongoing Turf Wars That's partly because Google has been locked in an ugly feud with Microsoft (which spent $10.49 million on lobbying[10] in 2013) for years. They've fought over virtually every major technology issue over the past decade, everything from search results, patents, privacy policies and security measures. What both companies have in common, though, is that the people on the front lines of their ongoing war gained experience in the trenches of Washington politics. The arms race has almost certainly contributed to Microsoft's hire of Mark Penn, a former spin doctor for Hillary Clinton who now serves as chief strategy officer under CEO Satya Nadella. That came not long after Google brought on Susan Molinari, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, to work as a vice president for public policy. Sheryl Sandberg, meanwhile, worked at the U.S. Treasury Department before serving as Facebook's chief operating officer. Uber, in its quest to become more than a taxi service, caught on earlier this year by hiring Obama's highly visible campaign manager, David Plouffe, to improve its corporate image. Since then Uber has refuted the claim that its drivers don't earn a fair salary[11] and released a later disputed report[12] that Uber's presence in an area reduces the number of drunk drivers. 'The technology sector is becoming very entrenched with government policy,' Zelizer said. 'It's not just a booming industry but one that has been consciously removed from politics and is now trying to strengthen its presence in Washington.'

But that frenetic growth and ambition hasn't converted into Washington influence, something the company hopes to remedy with last week's hiring of former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Other technology heavyweights, from Google and Microsoftto Apple, have already boosted political spending as their ambition extends well beyond laptops and search results.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> Big tech's big hope is that high-priced D.C. insiders like Carney can cut through regulatory hurdles that threaten to derail a host of ambitious plans.&lt;nl/&gt; Taking on Carney, who served as <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spokesman from 2011 to 2014, puts Amazon just a call away from the most powerful lawmakers in the country. It's a sea-change for a company that's remained mostly quiet in Washington even as rivals have jumped into the lobbying frenzy. But Carney[2]'s hiring also puts an exclamation point on the idea that, if the cool kids in Silicon Valley really want to take over the world, first they need to make nice with Washington power brokers.&lt;nl/&gt; Unlike Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other giants that have spent the last few years building up their public policy departments Amazon has mostly tried to go it alone, and without much success.&lt;nl/&gt; Googlehas spent more on lobbying[3] than any other corporation since 2012. Part of the reason for that is the company's plan to develop driverless cars, which were forbidden on many California streets. Now, after a campaign that included giving politicians test rides and suggesting driverless cars as a remedy for drunk driving, Googlewon 25 permits[4] to test autonomous vehicles.&lt;nl/&gt; There have also been reports that Googleis developing its own drone program, a possible foray into the delivery strategy Amazon is eyeing.&lt;nl/&gt; Facebook, led by founder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>has become an increasingly vocal part of the debate over immigration reform. More than 15-percent of the company's workers hold H-1B visas, which permit foreign workers to live inside the U.S. temporarily if they work in a specialist occupation. Other Facebook priorities include[5] protecting freedom of expression online, Internet security education, privacy legislation and online advertising laws.&lt;nl/&gt; Playing Catch Up&lt;nl/&gt; Amazon has been less conspicuous, and consistent, when it comes to public policy.&lt;nl/&gt; First the company appeared indecisive on its support for the Marketplace Fairness Act[6], a bill that died in Congress before it would have forced e-commerce companies to collect sales tax from customers in each state where their products are sold. Amazon initially opposed the bill, pulling an about-face upon the realization that, with brick-and-mortar warehouses in states throughout the U.S., it would be on the hook to collect taxes anyway. Amazon decided it might as well advocate competitors like eBay being forced to pay taxes, too.&lt;nl/&gt; Then the Federal Aviation Administration issued new rules that grounded the plan[7] to deliver packages by drone. More than a year after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company hopes to cut out the middle man and deliver its own packages, the FAA adopted regulations forcing drone pilots to operate their aircraft only within their line of sight.&lt;nl/&gt; Now, as Amazon expands into everything from bigger delivery plans to movie production, it's certain to run into resistance from more than just technology rivals.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Business doesn't like to be regulated but it loves to hire politicians,' said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. 'Amazon has a number of public policy issues they have to deal with and they're looking for people who can get them into a room to meet with powerful officials. They want someone who has a feel for Washington, and companies realize there's no one better for that than the people who have actually been there.'&lt;nl/&gt; Today's tech giants are investing heavily outside their own roots in part because computers and software can now be found in virtually all consumer products - from toasters to automobiles. That makes almost everything a potential tech product. So it makes sense that, as lawmakers attempt to determine, say, how driverless cars will operate and whether delivery drones are legal, the companies that stand to profit off such ventures will want to influence policy from the inside.&lt;nl/&gt; Amazon has known for years that it wants to do more than push Barnes and Noble[8] out of business. Between 2003 to 2014 it increased its lobby spending from $920,000 to $4.9 million, according to OpenSecrets.org[9]. Googlehas also known it wants to be more than a search engine, and has increased its schmooze spending from $80,000 to $16.83 million over the same period.&lt;nl/&gt; Ongoing Turf Wars&lt;nl/&gt; That's partly because Googlehas been locked in an ugly feud with Microsoft (which spent $10.49 million on lobbying[10] in 2013) for years. They've fought over virtually every major technology issue over the past decade, everything from search results, patents, privacy policies and security measures. What both companies have in common, though, is that the people on the front lines of their ongoing war gained experience in the trenches of Washington politics.&lt;nl/&gt; The arms race has almost certainly contributed to Microsoft's hire of Mark Penn, a former spin doctor for Hillary Clinton who now serves as chief strategy officer under CEO Satya Nadella. That came not long after Googlebrought on Susan Molinari, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, to work as a vice president for public policy. Sheryl Sandberg, meanwhile, worked at the U.S. Treasury Department before serving as Facebook's chief operating officer.&lt;nl/&gt; Uber, in its quest to become more than a taxi service, caught on earlier this year by hiring Obama's highly visible campaign manager, David Plouffe, to improve its corporate image. Since then Uber has refuted the claim that its drivers don't earn a fair salary[11] and released a later disputed report[12] that Uber's presence in an area reduces the number of drunk drivers.&lt;nl/&gt; 'The technology sector is becoming very entrenched with government policy,' Zelizer said. 'It's not just a booming industry but one that has been consciously removed from politics and is now trying to strengthen its presence in Washington.'&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url

In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon's chief spokesman, Jay Carney - the former press secretary to President Obama.</p><p>The public relations and lobbying push represents a new face for Amazon in Washington. Facing greater skepticism about its growing power over retail, including from President Trump, Amazon is following the well-worn path of oil, pharmaceutical and even other large tech companies, which try to bend policy in their favor by enhancing connections with federal officials.</p><p>Amazon is sweeping the nation's capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.</p><p>The company's more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company's overall reputation, is a break from its past.

Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D.

But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company's push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition.

The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.</p><p>\"The concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters.

The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.</p><p>In the span of a few weeks this summer, Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration, visited Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, where the company had small retailers on hand to talk about how Amazon had helped their businesses.

But concerns are growing over a possible resurgence, as several states are seeing an uptick in cases, including Texas, which just marked its third straight day of record COVID-19 hospitalizations.</p><p>And new cases in Florida topping 2,000 for the second day in a row.</p><p>Well, the deadly shooting of a black man in Atlanta sparking a new wave of protests. Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by a police at a Wendy's restaurant on Friday. His death ruled a homicide after an autopsy showed that he suffered two gun shot wounds to the back.</p><p>Police now have released body cam footage of that incident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you've had too much to drink to be driving, so put your hands behind your back for me.

Rolfe could face murder charges over the incident.

So far no reports of anyone becoming sick.</p><p>And those, Dagen, are your headlines from the newsroom. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Cheryl, we'll see you shortly.</p><p>Dow Futures taking a major hit this morning, we have a 446 point loss on the blue-chips at the moment, with fears growing over a coronavirus resurgence and the potential for shutdown measures going back into place.</p><p>Joining the conversation is CFRA Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall, along all morning. Maslansky and Partners President Lee Carter, good morning Lee. PWC Partner Mitch Rochelle and Washington Examiner Commentary Writer and Editor Siraj Hashmi.</p><p>Welcome one and all.</p><p>Sam, what do you make of these markets here after last weeks sell-off?</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CFRA CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Good morning Dagen. Good morning everybody. My belief is that he market was looking for a reason to consolidate a lot of the recent gains and it found three. Last week on Tuesday we had the announcement by the National Bureau of Economic Research that we have fallen into recession and history tells us that 90 days after that announcement the market has been negative four of five times.</p><p>We also had the FOMC report its findings, basically implying that interest rates will remain low until 2022, causing some investors to think, gee, maybe they know something we don't and that things are worse than expected.</p><p>And then lastly, as you just mentioned, the increased likelihood of COVID cases sweeping the country as reopen, which could therefore put the V- shaped economic recovery into question.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch Rochelle, get in here, but I -- Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve said something last week that I literally have been saying for months and it could be years before we get back to people finding jobs. It's the issue of permanent job destruction that people won't come back. Is that fully factored into the market or do you think markets overreacted to what Powell said last week?</p><p>MITCH ROCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: No, I think that that's exactly the point, Dagen. I -- you know, the V versus U shaped recovery probably isn't the debate when you look at all the data, I think on paper it's going to look like a V. The question is, is the second leg of the V as tall as the one on the way down. And do we get to the point where our economy is the same size as it was before?</p><p>I think that's the real challenge. And my question to Sam around that is, what's baked into the market in terms of the expansion of the economy? Is it, you know, factoring in the reality that we may not get back to where we were for quite some time?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sam?</p><p>STOVALL: Well Dagen and Mitch, I think basically we have to wait and see what the second quarter GDP numbers look like. Our expectation is for a 30 -- 32 percent decline in the second quarter following a 5 percent decline in the first quarter, but then we start to see what is the likelihood for an advance.</p><p>Right now we're forecasting a 24 percent gain in the third quarter followed by a more than 9 percent advance in the fourth quarter. So, really I think we are trying to figure out exactly what happens even before the bad quarter gets reported.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria spoke with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow about the recovery yesterday on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Kudlow striking an optimistic tone. Sam, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: We've got Jay Powell saying we're going to keep interest rates where they are, near zero, until 2023, as the road to recovery is long. Do you think it's going to be even worse with what we're seeing in the country today, all of this protesting and rioting?</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: I think with the rescue package and the reopening of the economy as we transition, 80 percent of small businesses, according the Chamber of Commerce, are reopening.</p><p>Business applications, new business applications are roaring, tremendous demand for housing homes, that's new homes. I think we're off to the races in what will be a very strong V-shaped recovery.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sam, Kudlow also urging replacing that extra unemployment benefit boost, that $600 a week with a return-to-work bonus. Again, there is that compulsion to spend more money to do something to help the economy rather than just letting these businesses reopen.</p><p>STOVALL: Well, I think that the -- there is the encouragement. By keeping interest rates low that would make for business loans to be more easily applied for and received. It would also help to pay down the debt that's being incurred.</p><p>Because of this now the debt represents close to 130 percent of U.S. GDP, basically looking back to what happened right after World War II.</p><p>So, I think that there is the need for encouragement for people to go back to work, not to be paid too much to want to just stay at home.</p><p>But I think, again, expectations are that we will be seeing a V-shaped recovery, and we're looking for, as I mentioned, about 24 percent gain in Q3, and we're -- so right now I believe that the market sell-off is a natural correction, every bull market since World War II has seen one that has averaged about 10.3 percent. So, I think we have to go down to around the 2850 level before we can decide whether this correction has run its course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When would -- do investors start worrying about the presidential election? Is that -- are people concerned about that? Because we talk about what 130 percent -- the debt is 130 percent of GDP, how are we going help pay that down, higher taxes?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, that's one of the alternatives. Certainly, keeping interest rates low so that the economy is revived and that increase in tax revenues and so forth would help pay down the debt.</p><p>Inflation is another technique that has been used in the past, but that tended to fail after the Vietnam War in the 1970s. So yes, I think now little by little investors are focusing on the upcoming election.</p><p>Traditionally it is the three month period just prior to the election where the market's direction gives investors an idea as to which party will end up getting elected. So, a downward move in the market from July 31 through October 31 would signal a replacement of the administration.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sam, good to see you as always. Thank you so much. Sam Stovall joining us. We're just getting started this morning. Coming up next I'm going to speak with the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, Paul Howard. After a weekend of unrest in Atlanta, amid that fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks by a police officer.</p><p>At 7:00 o'clock Texas Congressman Chip Roy is here, as Texas records its highest number of COVID-19 hospitalizations since the outbreak began in March.</p><p>Then in the 8:00 o'clock hour, a former CKE Restaurant CEO Randy Posner gives us his outlook for the economic recovery.</p><p>The CEO of Quicken Loans Jay Farner weights in with tips to refinance your mortgage as mortgage rates hit now record lows.</p><p>And Indeed Chief Economist Jed Kolko tells us where to expect the next jobs in America post pandemic.</p><p>Coming up, the unmasking of General Michael Flynn insight from one former intelligence who tells Maria Bartiromo, moves by the Obama Administration were highly inappropriate.</p><p>Plus, keeping big tech in check, Amazon now under the microscope in two separate states as its business practices come into question. We've got the details.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Unrest in Atlanta, after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a police officer, Rayshard Brooks was killed by police in a Wendy's parking lot after reportedly falling asleep in his car.</p><p>A scuffle broke out after he failed a sobriety test. Brook's death ruled a homicide. One officer fired and could face murder charges.</p><p>Joining me now Fulton Country District Attorney Paul Howard. District Attorney, thank you so much for being here this morning.</p><p>PAUL HOWARD, FULTON COUNTRY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Will you bring charges -- will you bring charges against the -- the fired officer, Garrett Rolfe, with 100 percent certainty? And when, this week, will you announce that?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, what we're doing now is we are examining all of the evidence and circumstances in the case and what we've planned to do is to make a decision and make that announcement then as we've indicated probably on Wednesday.</p><p>There are some technical things that we must make sure that they are done prior to the announcement. One of those things is to confirm the ballistics. We have to make sure that the guns that were retrieved from the incident, that they're actually matched to the projectiles in the body of Mr. Brooks.</p><p>But, we are hopeful that we can make this announcement probably some time around Wednesday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What charges are you expecting to bring? Can you give us insight into that?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, right now under Georgia law we are looking at three possible charges, first charge being murder. Murder is a -- a charge that carries a life sentence, up to death and it is the -- essentially around and intentional killing.</p><p>The second charge that we're looking at is the charge of felony murder. Felony murder involves a death that occurs as a result of the commission of an underlying felony. And in this case the underlying felony would be aggravated assault.</p><p>The third charge that we are considering as we consider the facts would be voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you considering charges or are you at least weighing charges against the second officer who's been put on leave, Devin Brosnan, is that something you're looking at?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes, we're looking at the conduct of both officers in this circumstance and when we reach our conclusions, as I've indicated on Wednesday, we will reach conclusions regarding both officers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The fact that a taser was taken away from one of the officers, did that -- because I know, and this is laid out in the \"New York Times\" today, that officers, broadly speaking, are trained that they have the right to escalate their use of force if they believe someone is threatening to incapacitate them. How does the taser play into your decision making on charges?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, the taser is something that happened in this case and it is certainly one of the factors that we have to consider, but what we are focused upon is the moment of the shooting. He was shot twice and we're looking at those circumstances that occurred at that moment.</p><p>What the law says is, at the time that that shot was fired what we have to determine, based upon the perceptions of a reasonable officer is whether or not the, Mr. Brooks, at that time posed a serious threat of bodily harm or death to that officer or someone else. And so that's what we're doing, we are focused upon that moment to see whether or not the facts indicate whether or not that occurred.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Before we go District Attorney, in terms of the arson and the burning of the Wendy's restaurant, any leads in that? Will you fully -- if you have a suspect eventually in custody will you prosecute that case?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes, we -- we would. There is an investigation that is occurring right now and as of this moment I believe also there's information that's been put out on the media of some possible person who might have been involved. But when that person or persons is apprehended we certainly would prosecute them in our office.</p><p>MCDOWELL: District Attorney Paul Howard. District Attorney, thank you so much for being here. Please come back. Please keep us up to date on what happens --</p><p>HOWARD: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in the death of Rayshard Brooks.</p><p>Coming up, the unmasking of General Michael Flynn, insight from one former intelligence official telling Maria Bartiromo that moves by the Obama Administration were highly inappropriate.</p><p>Plus, getting back to work, the Chief Economist for job search engine Indeed tells us where to look for America's up and coming jobs post pandemic. Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. The unmasking of General Michael Flynn, former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Granell on \"Sunday Morning Future's\" yesterday, calling moves by the Obama Administration highly inappropriate.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We had Ron Johnson on the other day, a couple of weeks ago, here on this program and his investigation is centering on the transition of power from the Obama Administration to the Trump Administration and during that transition when Trump was fully in place there were 125 leaks during the first 126 days of the Administration.</p><p>RICHARD GRANELL, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I think that transition period is key and it's why -- once Donald Trump won the election in 2016, all the way through to Inauguration Day, that period of time is when we know who is coming into the White House, we know the team like -- like General Flynn and his team and President Trump, that's when we're supposed to have the Obama Administration or the current administration begin to hand off and have a transition time.</p><p>That's we have an election in November and an Inauguration in January, is for a peaceful transition of power. That was blown by the Obama Administration and I just don't think that unmasking during the transition period is appropriate, especially at the levels that they did.</p><p>And we even had Joe Biden, the Vice President of the United States at the time, unmasking in -- in this transition period, and I believe it was in January when they literally were on the down slope to Trump's inauguration. This is inappropriate. I think you can make the argument for unmasking at other times, but -- but to unmask during this transition period, to me, is another level --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This as efforts by Flynn to have his criminal charges dismissed, that goes on. Siraj, we learned last week that Lindsey Graham was granted sweeping subpoena power by the Senate Judiciary Committee. How high will he go? What do you make of all of this?</p><p>SIRAJ HASHMI, WASHINGTON EXAMINER COMMENTARY WRITER AND EDITOR: Well, as Attorney General Barr indicated that he won't open the criminal investigation into former President Barack Obama or former Vice President Joe Biden, so it could go as high up as say maybe the Attorney General Eric Holder or Loretta Lynch.</p><p>I -- I would -- I would say more Loretta Lynch because Attorney -- Eric Holder wasn't at -- in -- in office at that time. But, I will say, a couple takeaways from acting DNI's Rick Granell's interview, was that one, the over-classification of the Michael Flynn investigation sort of shows you or indicates that there may have been a cover-up within the intelligence community.</p><p>And I think the next step here by John Ratcliffe, who is now the DNI, has to find out who ordered these over-classifications and also the inappropriateness of the timing of the unmasking during the transition period sort of shows you that the Obama Administration was almost trying to sew seeds of disruption that will continue to undermine the Trump presidency and were -- and his presidency as of now is currently still recovering from that disruption.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee, do the American people and voters understand the seriousness of this, because a lot of has happened obviously in the three and half years since this unmasking, and particularly in the middle of this pandemic and dramatic economic downturn. What do voters think of this?</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT OF MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS: I don't think this is on the top of voter's radars. Sadly there's so much news, there's so much that's going on that impacts individual's pocketbooks and livelihoods, when you've got 6 out of 10 Americans saying that they don't think that they're going to be able to make their bills this month because of the economy, because of what's going on right now related to COVID, this is not top of mind.</p><p>What I do know is that this an issue that's going along partisan lines. If you're a Trump supporter you are outraged at the unmasking. If you are a Democrat and you are a Biden supporter or if you are just opposed to Trump in general, this is something that has you outraged when you learn about it -- not outraged, (inaudible) they'll explain (ph) it away (ph).</p><p>And so, very, very much on party lines. I don't think this is going to have a huge impact unless and until the Trump Administration can tell us right away that's going to make it resonate with the American people. Right now, I think it's just a lot of a wall covering frankly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you all. Coming up, fear of flying, new reports reveal public health officials fail to alert passengers and crew members who had flown with COVID positive travelers.</p><p>Plus, Americans eager to ease back into normalcy, but are common public areas still unsafe. We'll tell which places posed the greatest risk for contracting coronavirus.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 15th. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Concerns over a spike in coronavirus cases sparking a global selloff. Futures sharply lower, but well off their lows of the morning. A 568 point loss on the blue chips at the moment.</p><p>Taking on global market action in Europe it is the same scene, red across the board. Losses of one percent or more in England, France and Germany. Restrictions are easing up in the UK as retailers reopen. Many European countries opening their boarders to travelers today.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was a selloff in all four major markets there. Beijing re-imposing lockdowns after a spike in coronavirus cases. Meantime, more signs of a slow recovery in China. Industrial output coming in below expectations, up 4.4 percent in May. Retail sales declining 2.8 percent.</p><p>Oil, in the meantime, sliding, as rising coronavirus cases fuel concerns over demand. The cost of crude down more than two percent.</p><p>A US fighter jet reportedly crashes in England. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, Dagen, here's what we know right now. British media outlets are reporting that the F-15 fighter jet crashed into the North Sea, this would be of the Northern coast of England. It happened earlier this morning. We're hearing the jet was taking part in a formation drill at the time, and the pilot was the only person on board. Rescue crews have arrived. We're going to keep monitoring any reports we get on that search coming out of England.</p><p>Back here at home, gas prices are marching higher for the sixth straight week according the AAA. National average is $2.10 a gallon, but that is still down $.70 from a year ago, and just slightly up from the low of $1.74 in April, as states began to ease travel restrictions. Analysts expect gas prices to move higher as the summer driving season heats up.</p><p>Well, today major league baseball owners are expected to announce what is next for the 2020 season, what's left of it anyway. The players union ending negotiations over the weekend, and now they are reportedly demanding the league just set the schedule and tell them when to show up. The union rejected the latest offer of a 72 game season, and players receiving 70 percent prorated pay.</p><p>And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Walmart tests self checkout only location, and its being tested in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It could go national if it works out. Slack to offer permanent work from home to most employees. The company extending its work from home policy indefinitely beyond September 1. And this one, tourists dip their toes in water as top Mexican beach getaways reopen. As of now, hotels can allow guests into the water, but at least in Mexico the public beaches do remain closed, Dagen. And those are a lot of your headlines this morning. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Amazon under pressure. State investigators from California and Washington state reportedly looking into the tech giant's business practices, particularly how the company treats third party sellers and its online marketplace. Joining me now, Tech Analyst, Managing Partner at Starship Capital, John Meyer. John, good of you to be here. What are they looking at, and how big of a risk is this to Amazon's business model?</p><p>JOHN MEYER, MANAGING PARTNER, STARSHIP CAPITAL: So, what is being looked at right now is the dynamic between Amazon and external sellers. So, that let's say is mom and pop shop selling their product on Amazon and how Amazon is able to use data on, the purchase data, the amount of money going into sales and marketing, to actually create competing products with Amazon's own third party vendors. And the reason this is so key is that, due to the fact that Amazon has so much data on both what consumers are buying as well as how third party vendors are selling it, it's leading to the conclusion that it's a handful of very unfair business practices, as it relates to these third party vendors.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, is this just a sliver of the regulatory risk that Amazon is facing? Particularly given how much more powerful this behemoth has gotten during the pandemic, the coronavirus shutdowns.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER AND BUSINESS DEVELOPER, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS: I think the fact that we're all stuck at home, and we're Googling, and shopping has a lot to do with it. But if you look back in history and big conglomerates that have been created, that have been ultimately broken up by government, look at the breakup of AT&amp;T, as an example, so my question is, to John, what are the, who are their principal competitors out there? Obviously smaller in scale, that would benefit from a breakup, or has Amazon just monopolized the market? Do the mom and pops have an opportunity at an eBay or an Etsy to compete? Or is all of the big data that Amazon have make it impossible for them to compete outside of Amazon?</p><p>MEYER: Yeah, I think right now Amazon simply has too much data on its consumers and its vendors and, honestly needs to be broken up. Right now, as a small business, there aren't many other places you can go to reach as many eyeballs as Amazon. And the problem is Amazon reels you in with the idea that data will help you as a third party vendor, but now what's happening is Amazon is trying to create their own brand within their own store, to then compete with the mom and pop shop. So, I think that is where this begins to get quite dangerous small to medium sized businesses where Amazon is using again, their own platform to sell their own, you know, third party branded products to compete with everyone trying to sell on the platform itself.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I believe that regulators in Europe are bringing charges related to this very third party seller issue. Meantime, the House Judiciary Committee wants the heads of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and the Alphabet to testify as part of the committee's Tech Competition Investigation. This, amid growing scrutiny over the power of technology platforms. John, your take.</p><p>MEYER: Well, I think at this point, you know, companies like Google and Apple simply need to be broken up. I think if you put Amazon in there as well, company like Facebook where they're dominating based again on data, and as we get into the next few years, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning are getting more and more powerful, these are technologies that are going to make these companies even more monopolistic. And so, I think I've consistently said that government lags behind, you know, three to five years, always in terms of regulation as it relates to possible monopolistic practices. So, I think it's a great next step.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, you just said that you think that Google and Apple need to be broken up. That was kind of a throw away comment, and you, it came across like that's kind of a foregone conclusion. I know a lot of people who might disagree with you on that.</p><p>MEYER: Yeah, well, you know, if you look at the size of these companies, and their scale and reach at this point, it's orders of magnitude launch are beyond anything we've seen before. And, you know, the problem with a company like Google, who I put in that list, is again, that they literally own the entire, you know, online search business. If you look at them and Facebook combined, you don't have anywhere else to go. And I think the size of these businesses is again, to the point where you cannot compete as an upstart player. There's a reason why there hasn't been a competitor to Google in over a decade. Or a competitor to Facebook in over a decade.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Before we go, Siraj, if you look at Washington and if you have maybe if the Democrats take the Senate, these technology companies are, broadly speaking, in terms of their employees, very progressive. They're big donors to Democratic causes and candidates. Is that something that, are Democrats more likely, would a Democrat in the White House more likely crack down on these companies or not? Do they think that they would get a free pass if they Democrats are fully in power in D.C.?</p><p>SIRAJ HASHMI, COMMENTARY WRITER AND EDITOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: That's a very good question, because it depends on which Democrats end up filling a potential Biden administration. If you have say, Elizabeth Warren, at say the helm of say the, I wouldn't say the Justice Department, but having a significant position in the Cabinet, then you could see actually a big break up of a lot of these tech companies, because she has probably been one of the leading voices, along with Senator Bernie Sanders. And, sort of at least invigorating and energizing the progressive base to get tough on Amazon. And you hear, obviously, AOC in the last year, sort of taking a victory lap when Amazon abandoned its plans to build its second headquarters in New York City. So, its definitely a good possibility that Democrats will not show any favor to these tech companies, as much as Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And, Elon Musk's no fan of Amazon. It's when Amazon censored Alex Berenson's book on the coronavirus and wouldn't publish it. Elon Musk, he just tweets, break them up, monopoly, and boom that book magically appears on Kindle. John Meyer, it was great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>MEYER: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, we're seeing a sharp selloff at the open. Futures taking a hit amid growing fears of a coronavirus resurgence in a potential lockdown. Hear about Governor Cuomo's latest threats. Plus, swapping statues, protestors calling to replace Confederate monuments in some Southern states with modern day role models. We'll tell you who.</p><p>MCDOWELL: More protests over the weekend in Seattle. Demonstrators sealing off a six block radius in the Capitol Hill neighborhood dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Mayor Jenny Durkan saying she does not know when police will reenter the area and says that the city could be seeing a summer of love. President Trump weighing in the situation, tweeting this, does anyone notice how little the radical left takeover of Seattle is being discusses in the fake news media? That is very much on purpose, because they know how badly this weakness and ineptitude play politically. The Mayor and Governor should be ashamed of themselves. Easily fixed. Exclamation point. Joining me now, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. We've talked about this in relation to, say, Minneapolis, Judge, or any you know, kind of disbanding of police departments. It's the tenth amendment, not only, right of the state, but obligation of the state, to basically, provide law and order, right?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Yes. And, good morning Dagen. The tenth amendment, which reserves to the states the power, the police power, also obliges them to exercise the police power, and provide basic safety. So, look, the Mayor says this is a carnival like atmosphere, and she want to play it out using a very soft touch. It's probably not a carnival like atmosphere if you live there. If you need to drive there. If you need to shop there, and if you need to use the public street and the public sidewalks that the government owns, which have been taken over by these people.</p><p>I agree with the President that its crazy, and the people have a right to live there. On the other hand, the Federal government does not have the right to come in unless, are you ready for this, the legislature of the state of Washington or if the legislature can't meet, because this thing is surrounding the Capitol Building, then the Governor of the state of Washington. So, right now it looks like its going to be a standoff. If you live there your property values are down. You can barely get in and out of your home.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's just astonishing that this is going on and, by the way, the summer of love? Well, the summer of love gave way to like assaults and drug overdoses, and quite frankly it is that idiocy that has reason that San Francisco is the way it is now. Is that they think that they, it harkens back to some fable, some fallacy left over from what, 51 years ago. I digress, because there's another, well, fiery garbage pit. We'll talk about New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo threatening to reverse the reopening process after photos of crowds ignoring social distancing guidelines in New York City and the Hamptons surfaced over the weekend. Judge Napolitano, you know what, because the city is closed, people are crowding into smaller areas. If they would open up more spaces, if they would open up the restaurants in a small way, open up the bars in a small way, you wouldn't have this clustering effect. What do you make of this?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I could not agree with you more. I mean, the Governor, is showing a dictatorial side to him, too many of you, too close together, and too small a space, I'm now going to punish you for it. That's not what elect Governor's for. Where was he when thousands of people were marching in the street over the death of George Floyd and then it manifested itself into anger about police, and then anger about government in general? So, he wasn't threatening to shut down the city then. But now he's threatening to shut down the city because a bunch of kids sat a little too close to each other at a table at a restaurant, which blocked its name from public view on West Broadway. Why doesn't he just let people do what they want to do and take the chances that they want to take. Enough is enough, Governor Cuomo.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and I'm still waiting for him to take ownership for that order sent to the nursing homes in late March of this year forcing them to take COVID positive patients back into nursing homes without, and it forbid them from testing those patients. I think that order was in place six weeks. Thousands died because of it. Ultimately that is on his shoulders. I digress. Judge Napolitano, it is great to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Don't hold your breath waiting for him to take responsibility for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I won't. Although I am blue in the face, because of Governor Cuomo. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Time for the morning buzz. First up, replacing Confederate monuments with celebrities. Black Lives Matter protests across the country renewing calls to remove statues and monuments from the Confederacy. Some local communities looking to replace them with modern day role models. Nashville considering honoring Dolly Parton. New Orleans could pay tribute to Britney Spears. Siraj.</p><p>HASHMI: I mean, Britney Spears might be a bridge too far, but I could get behind Dolly Parton. But I mean we live in a society where there's a lot of history revisionism. People don't understand their history. I mean, look at how these Confederate statues sort of, they are a symbol, obviously, you know, America was founded on rebellion, and when you have the Confederacy sort of waging rebellion to preserve the institution of slavery, keeping those statues in place is sort of a reward to the states that fought for the Confederacy to preserve slavery. I think, obviously, tearing them down isn't going to solve the issue, because all you're going to do is create more division. But if you take them down and put them in a museum so people can actually learn and understand our history.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HASHMI: That is something that is probably better, and it will encourage in people to actually learn about our history to understand how these figures actually tried to preserve something that is absolutely abhorrent. I will say one more thing and that is if we actually understood some of the statues that are being defaced, some of them are actually of known abolitionists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HASHMI: An effect that a lot of people are, say members of Black Lives Matter or Antifa, are defacing them, it says a lot about how much history is being taught in our country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed. Dolly Parton's the Queen of America, and there should be statues in every town square of Dolly. Moving on to Berlin, the nightclub industry gone for good. The club capital of the world is worried that tourists may not return because of social distancing. Club goers making up nearly a quarter of Berlin tourist every year, bringing in significant revenue. Lee, people who've never been to Berlin, maybe don't understand what some of the clubs involve, but it's a lot of close contact shall we say.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PARTNERS PRESIDENT, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY: Oh, my goodness. I mean, yeah. It is a party city and people are close, and they are sweating. So, it's a big problem for them. And they're going to have to figure out how they're going to survive through this. Some of their live streaming events, I think, are popular, but are they going to be able to make them through it? I don't know. It's a big deal for Berlin.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is. More Mornings with Maria before I say something I'll regret, after the break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020061501cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604R-GK01-DXH2-61G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 15, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Civil RightsCongress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eonomy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Human Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Race Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Recreation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Safety</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tourism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Travel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health Officials</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Reserved Powers</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEwNTIzMjE2MzQxNEFEQ0FDMUY4MTU5N0Q5QTNDOEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Torts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkMwQkJGMDI3MzdDNENGOEIyNzk3Q0JGODdEQjgwNUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjZDOUU3OUM0OEU3NDc2MEFEOTUxQ0QwQzhBODFGMjg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

It also contrasts with U.S. lawmakers' slower approach to the issue, as they start discussing how to keep in check the growing power of the tech industry's titans.</p><p> The EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said she's taking a \"very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer.\"</p><p> In addition to selling its own products, Amazon allows third-party retailers to sell their goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from third-party sellers.</p><p> In doing so, Amazon collects data about activity on its platform that, the EU says, it might be able to use to favor its own products for sale. In particular, the EU will look at how Amazon determines which trader is selected as the default seller of an item that a customer wants to buy.</p><p> The EU opened a preliminary investigation into the issue last year, and Vestager said it has shown that \"Amazon appears to use competitively sensitive information - about marketplace sellers, their products and transactions on the marketplace.\"</p><p> The investigation could lead to fines and eventually cause Amazon to change the way it works. Previous EU antitrust cases have resulted in such change, though it is unclear how big their ultimate effect has been in dealing with the EU's concerns. For example, Google had to tweak the display of search results, which the EU had said favored Google goods and services.</p><p>Amazon said it \"will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\"</p><p> In a parallel but separate case, Germany's competition regulator said Wednesday that Amazon was changing some of its business conditions for traders on its online marketplace worldwide after the regulator raised concerns about some terms. The case is not like the EU's investigation about data on traders but about contractual terms, such as a one-sided exemption from liability to Amazon's benefit as well as the place of jurisdiction for disputes.</p><p> Other EU countries like Austria, Luxembourg and Italy are also independently investigating Amazon, but EU spokeswoman Lucia Caudet said the national inquiries did not overlap with the EU investigation.</p><p> The EU's investigations into major companies like Amazon have led the way in a global push to more tightly regulate tech giants, as many governments wonder if they are becoming too big for the good of the wider economy.</p><p> Among the key questions are not only whether the tech giants abuse their market dominance to choke off competition, potentially stifling choice for consumers and innovation, but also whether they are adequately protecting users' data and paying their fair share of taxes in countries where they operate.</p><p> U.S. authorities have started to follow Europe's lead in taking a closer look at the big tech companies, particularly after the scandal in which Facebook was found to have allowed data on millions of people to be used by other companies, including to try to influence the 2016 election that made Donald Trump the new U.S. president. According to published reports, U.S. regulators are poised to fine Facebook $5 billion for that scandal, but the wider debate of reining in tech companies' powers has only just begun.</p><p> The House Judiciary Committee in the U.S. is investigating the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Congress is this week holding a two-day hearing on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency, Libra, which governments in the United States and Europe have been skeptical about.</p><p> In Europe, one of the big questions is how to tax these companies, which do huge business across the continent but pay taxes only in the EU nation where their local headquarters are based, often a low-tax haven like Luxembourg or the Netherlands. The result is they pay a far lower tax rate than traditional businesses.</p><p>France has tried to tackle the problem by unilaterally proposing a 3% tax on big tech companies' revenue in the country. The U.S. government is not happy about that and finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthy countries are discussing the issue this week in Paris.</p><p> Ursula von der Leyen, the newly appointed EU Commission president who should take up her role in November, has said the issue will be a priority for her.</p><p> The tax issue has brought Amazon into the EU's crosshairs before. Two years ago, officials ordered it to pay $295 million in back taxes to Luxembourg after finding that the company profited from a tax-avoidance deal with the tiny European country.</p><p> Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Amazon and Deliveroo have five days to allay concerns.'We assume a phase-two investigation will now follow, opening a further six-month window of uncertainty for Deliveroo,' Giles Thorne, equity analyst at Jefferies, told the Financial Times[1].Amazon said in May it was leading a $575 million funding round in the startup following the closure of its own Amazon Restaurants. The investment would give Amazon a 16% stake[2] in Deliveroo, the British rival to UberEats that was founded in 2013.Deliveroo has been working with the Competition and Markets Authority to convince regulators Amazon's investment will inject competition into the sector and create more business for restaurants and work opportunities, but the authority said Wednesday the deal could discourage Amazon from restarting its own delivery service and damage competition with UberEats and Just Eat PLC, the other two players in the sector.The authority noted Amazon, which entered the fresh grocery delivery industry in the U.K. three years ago with its Amazon Fresh, Pantry and Amazon Grocery, had $14.5 billion in sales in the U.K. last year and Deliveroo, which operates in more than 100 towns, saw its sales grow to $659 million.Bloomberg reported[3] Deliveroo needs Amazon's cash and soon. </p><p>The company burned through $263 million in 2018. Delaying the investment also could damage Deliveroo's ability to compete against UberEats and Just Eat PLC.Regulators likely are looking for assurances from Amazon that it won't try to buy Deliveroo outright for five years.'If the deal were to proceed in its current form, there's a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services as these markets develop,' said Andrea Gomes da Silva[4], executive director of the authority.'A homegrown U.K. business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters,' an Amazon spokesperson told the Times. 'Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation by helping Deliveroo continue to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009remain competitive in the restaurant food delivery space by creating more highly skilled jobs, innovating in the restaurant food delivery sector and developing new products for customers.'Analysts see the authority's move as part of an overall effort to reign in big tech companies.'The regulator clearly feels it needs to show they leave no stone unturned when it comes to big tech,' one competition lawyer close to the deal told the Times.

Continue reading Amazon Walmart Whole Paycheck Tracker: Staying Secure, Gaining New Ground And Getting Competitive</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The American economy is reopening for business and consumers are starting to head back toward their lives in the physical world. But shopping will likely see much of the great digitization wave      that s swept over it in recent weeks stay in place because shoppers like the speed and convenience, as PYMNTS consumer surveys indicate. That means Walmart and Amazon will square off more than      ever when it comes to collecting their share of the consumer s whole paycheck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week saw a lot of expansion efforts out of Walmart, while Amazon has been playing defense on several fronts. The latest developments:</p><p>Amazon</p><p>Big News Of The Week: Mr. Bezos Is Going To Washington</p><p>News broke this week that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is willing to appear on Capitol Hill amid a series of increasingly pointed requests in recent months for him to testify.</p><p>Amazon confirmed via attorney Robert Kelner that it will cooperate with lawmakers looking to investigate the company s corporate practices and that it s willing to make appropriate executives      available for questions.</p><p>Kelner noted that this  includes making Jeff Bezos available to testify at a hearing with the other [Big Tech] CEOs this summer. </p><p>The announcement marked a change in attitude about Bezos appearing before the House Judiciary Committee regarding an antitrust investigation of Big Tech. But there s evidence that if Bezos      won t come willingly, he might face a subpoena compelling him to appear.</p><p>Amazon had previously only confirmed it would send an  appropriate  executive to testify how the firm utilizes third-party data, but Congress made clear that Bezos was the only appropriate      person. Last summer, Amazon Associate General Counsel Nate Sutton denied the firm had harvested information from third parties for its own use.</p><p>Security Save Of The Week: Blocking The Biggest DDoS Attack Attempt Ever</p><p>But fending off an increasingly aggressive Congress wasn t Amazon s only exercise in self-defense this week. Amazon Web Services also defeated the largest DDoS attack ever attempted.</p><p>According to ZDNet, the attack came with peak traffic volume of 2.3 terabits per second   the largest such effort ever recorded. Amazon was hit by the attempted attack in February and first      detailed the issue in its first-quarter 2020 threat report.</p><p>The massive attack attempt was thwarted by AWS Shield, a service custom-built to defend the cloud-computing platform s clients from being tagged by DDoS attacks. Where the attack originated or      what end the attackers were seeking remains unreported.</p><p>However, this isn t the first attack of this kind that Amazon has seen, although the firm reported that all previous attempts had been much smaller than 1 Tbps.</p><p>Partnership Opportunity Of The Week: Amazon s  Not-Prime-Day  Sale</p><p>Prime Day, the Internet s favorite garage sale and made-up holiday, isn t canceled, but it will be on hold for a few months. In its place, a new event is rising. On June 22, shoppers will      reportedly have the big Amazon sale to look forward to.</p><p>Experts are predicting the promotion   dubbed the  Big Style Sale    might be just the lifeline that apparel brands desperately need to reach radically diminished customer bases.</p><p> You ve got a bunch of brands stuck with merchandise and this is going to be an opportunity to generate cash,  Frank Poore, CEO and founder of e-commerce managed marketplace platform      CommerceHub, told Forbes.  This summer sale is a way to make up for some lost ground and also help some [Amazon] sellers move merchandise because there s a lot of apparel merchandise obviously      piled up from spring. </p><p>Moreover, given the build-up of inventory, this might be an unusual chance for Amazon to offer better-than-average prices on apparel. After all, brands of all kinds will be looking for a fast      way to clear out spring and summer stock in anticipation of fall.</p><p>DealNews predicts Amazon will offer discounts of up to 50 percent on its own clothing brands during the Big Style Sale and will push other brands and retailers to do the same. And just as Prime      Day inspires a lot of copycat sales, experts predict the Big Style Sale will do the same.</p><p>Amazon might also get the chance to sign on with new apparel players not currently on its marketplace, as the event might look pretty good to players who ve seen their sales fall sharply during      the pandemic.</p><p>Walmart</p><p>Big Move Of The Week: The Shopify Marketplace Pair-Up</p><p>Walmart learned this week that sometimes the best way to build a new friendship is to share a common enemy with one s new prospective friend. In this case, the new friend is Shopify and the      enemy is Amazon.</p><p>Walmart and Shopify reached a pact to add as many as 1,200 Shopify sellers to the Walmart marketplace this year, with a particular focus on adding small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).</p><p>Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke has previously classified his company as  the rebel army to Amazon s web empire,  and it seems like the rebels just gained access to millions of Walmart customers.</p><p>As for Walmart, the deal injects scale into attempts to build out its third-party marketplace while the global pandemic is providing a tailwind for eCommerce. Walmart saw its eCommerce sales      leap 74 percent to $21.5 billion in the quarter ended May 1.</p><p>As of now, there are just under 45,000 sellers on Walmart s site   up from roughly 23,800 sellers a year ago. Incremental additions from Shopify would of course move the needle quite a bit.</p><p>However, Walmart will still be trailing Amazon which has 2.5 million sellers on its platform. But hey, every rebel alliance has to start somewhere, right?</p><p>And with Amazon in U.S. antitrust regulators  crosshairs over how it treats third-party sellers, Walmart and Shopify might have found a way to combine their powers to steal a bit more of      Amazon s territory.</p><p>Big Healthcare Plays Part 1: The CareZone Acquisition</p><p>Walmart this week purchased key assets from Seattle health-technology platform CareZone for a reported $200 million or so.</p><p> Acquiring the technology platform of CareZone is another example of our continued commitment to helping lower the cost of healthcare for our 160 million customers who shop Walmart each week      while offering convenient options across multiple channels to help them manage their health and wellness,  Walmart said in a statement.</p><p>CareZone s technology helps consumers better digitally manage their prescription-drugs purchases. For example, the technology allows patients to scan insurance cards and prescription-drug      labels, making it easier for users to determine what s covered by their health plan or organize home-delivery instructions.</p><p> Adding our technology platform to Walmart s existing digital capabilities and physical reach creates a unique opportunity to redefine what the future of digital health and wellness can look      like,  CareZone said in a statement.</p><p>The move will help Walmart compete more directly with Amazon in the $500 billion prescription drug space. Amazon bought PillPack, a pharmacy delivery and medication management in 2018 for $753      million, edging out Walmart with a higher bid.</p><p>But interestingly, Walmart s deal with CareZone doesn t include the firm s pharmacy division, which sorts medications into pills packs and ships them directly to consumers. CNBC reported that      the company s pharmacy unit is currently involved in a lawsuit with Express Scripts, which dropped CareZone from its network over a contract dispute.</p><p>Big Healthcare Plays Part 2: Walmart s Newest Health Center Opens</p><p>Walmart this week expanded its entrance into affordable healthcare with the opening of its latest  comprehensive health center. </p><p>The Loganville, Ga., facility will offer primary and urgent care, labs, X-rays and diagnostics and dental, optical and hearing services at a site attached to the local Walmart store. The      company opened two other Georgia health centers in 2019, and the company said the sites have thus far received high praise from the public.</p><p> The Georgia community has embraced our first two Walmart Health locations, and we are thrilled to bring low, transparent pricing to Loganville,  Sean Slovenski, president of Walmart U.S.      Health and Wellness, said in a statement.  The price and availability of quality health care is one of the biggest concerns of Americans, and Walmart Health continues our history of launching      innovative products and programs that have transformed the industry and created significant healthcare savings. </p><p>Walmart has confirmed that it s on track to build more health centers but said the pandemic has somewhat slowed efforts at other sites. Slovenski said in a media interview that the firm is      committed to opening more sites as it aims to make U.S. healthcare more accessible and affordable for all.</p><p> It s clear our model is working, but there s also more to be done to ensure every family has access to care,  he said.  Walmart Health will continue to expand with additional locations opening      in Georgia this year. We owe it to our communities to continue our mission to bring quality care to those who need it, now more than ever. </p><p>The Battle Continues</p><p>Will Walmart Health Supercenters change the face of healthcare? That s a big project, but with support from CareZone s tech, it could work.</p><p>In fact, it s too soon to rule anything out   from Amazon s potential future as the nation s leading apparel seller to what Congress might ask Jeff Bezos to whether Walmart and Shopify can      break Amazon s digital dominance. Of course, Walmart has about 120 million visitors a month to its web site, while Amazon had 2.5 billion in the month of May. So, Amazon probably isn t losing      any sleep just yet about the fate of its digital dominance.</p><p>The only thing to do is keep watching and waiting   as the race for the consumer s whole paycheck winds on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/walmarthealth\">https://corporate.walmart.com/walmarthealth</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Pymnts<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2608683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-9K81-F08D-50S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1740\"/><timeReceived>3:55 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 20, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bezos didn't offer details, but he told the audience that \"it makes a lot of sense\" to regulate facial recognition tools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bezos' announcement comes after the company released a set of guidelines for facial recognition legislation back in February. The company called for a human review of the results when the technology is used by law enforcement, among other things.</p><p>Facial recognition technologies have raised privacy fears in recent years, with hundreds of Amazon employees signing a letter in 2018 protesting the company's sale of its technology to law enforcement. Some privacy advocates say the use of facial recognition technologies by law enforcement agencies, combined with the growing number of deployed security cameras, could create a massive surveillance state.</p><p>Some advocates suggested Amazon shouldn't be writing the rules for the use of the technology. Amazon creating legislation may be the \"worst idea ever,\" said Andrew Selepak, media professor and director of the graduate program in social media at the University of Florida.</p><p>\"Allowing Jeff Bezos and Amazon [to] write the laws or regulations that cover any technology involving consumer privacy, especially ones involving biometric data, is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,\" he said. \"Big tech wants to collect as much data about us as possible to use that information to market products to us and to sell our information to other advertisers. Biometric data from facial or fingerprint recognition systems is the next step in data collection.\"</p><p>Industry-approved facial recognition rules will turn large tech vendors into Big Brother instead of the government, he added. Tech vendors will be able to track customers, and \"they will be laughing all the way to the bank, right past Capitol Hill.\"</p><p>Amazon should receive praise for being transparent about its facial recognition efforts and its attempts to be accountable, added Damien Mason, a digital privacy advocate at ProPrivacy, a privacy-focused tech review site.</p><p>It's difficult for lawmakers to \"regulate and legislate things they don't understand within a reasonable time frame,\" he added. \"Governments worldwide are often archaic in their approach to tech, taking years to adopt policies that often end up insufficient to deal with exploits and abuse, of which there are many when it comes to facial recognition.\"</p><p>Mason urged caution to companies embracing facial recognition. \"Without knowing what is in the proposed legislation, it's difficult to support such an Orwellian approach that encroaches on the public's right to privacy by enabling mass surveillance,\" he said. Amazon's employees have already questioned the company's Rekognition product, \"and steering through those landmines ultimately seems impossible.\"</p><p>Many privacy advocates have called for facial recognition regulations, and Mike Deittrick, senior vice president of digital strategy and chief digital officer at mobile strategy vendor DMI, agreed. \"But guidelines should be created by an independent board of experts in academia, law, and practical ethics, as opposed to commercial entities who stand to gain financially from newly formed policies,\" he said.</p><p>A handful of bills regulating the technology have been introduced in the current session of Congress. Among them: The Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act in the Senate would require end-users to give consent to the use of facial recognition in many cases, and H.R. 3875 would prohibit the use of federal funding for purchasing facial recognition technologies.</p><p>Other experts welcomed Amazon's contributions, even if they are only a piece of the regulatory puzzle.</p><p>\"We don't know what Amazon's lobbying efforts will include yet, but it could be a good starting point,\" said Paul Bischoff, a consumer privacy expert at Comparitech.com, a security-focused tech research and review site. \"However, we need to include a diverse range of parties that include consumer advocates, private companies, law enforcement, digital rights activists, and elected officials. Any regulation that comes from a single company's point of view would almost certainly be biased in that company's favor.\"</p><p>Amazon's suggestions may be a good first draft of regulations, given a lack of expertise in Congress, added Jason David, CEO of Software Portal, a software review site.</p><p>Amazon's suggestions could \"then be amended and changed as Congress sees fit,\" he said. \"We absolutely should not just rubber-stamp whatever Amazon delivers, but it can certainly be treated as a starting point.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2300563672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6B-9W11-DY0W-42XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Supposedly, the company hopes that federal lawmakers will adopt its proposal as legislation. \"Our public policy team is actually working on facial recognition regulations; it makes a lot of sense to regulate that,\" CEO Jeff Bezos said in an appearance following Amazon's hardware event[2] yesterday.In February, Amazon shared \"proposed guidelines\"[3] for the responsible use of facial recognition for policymakers to consider when drafting new laws. But actually writing the laws goes one step further.Amazon has been criticized for its own \"Rekognition\"[4] system, which showed a gender and race bias[5]. Lawmakers and tech companies, including Amazon and Microsoft[6], have called for facial recognition to be regulated. </p><p>A few cities have banned the tech[7], and private companies like Axon[8] say they won't use facial recognition until it's more accurate.\"It's a perfect example of something that has really positive uses, so you don't want to put the brakes on it,\" Bezos reportedly said Wednesday. \"But, at the same time, there's also potential for abuses of that kind of technology, so you do want regulations. It's a classic dual-use kind of technology.\"As lawmakers call for more regulations around Big Tech[9], we may see more companies attempting to write the rules. In a way, that makes sense because they know the topics better than anyone. On the other hand, you could argue that allows Big Tech to regulate itself.

I checked the clock. Three minutes had passed.</p><p>I had just earned another 5 cents on a digital work marketplace run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk. At least I thought I had. Weeks later, I'm still not sure.</p><p>There are lots of ways to make a little money in this world. Amazon Mechanical Turk, which since 2005 has flourished, to varying degrees, in an obscure corner of the globe-striding behemoth's empire, offers an uncertain, mystifying and often maddening way to make very, very little money.</p><p>On Mechanical Turk - named for a chess-playing \"machine\" from the 18th century that concealed a living chess master - scores of thousands of humans earn pennies or dollars doing tasks that computers cannot yet easily do.</p><p>It works like this: Employers, known as requesters, post batches of what are called Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs, on Mechanical Turk's website. A task could be transcribing an invoice, or taking part in a study, or labeling photographs to train an artificial intelligence program. (Occasionally a photo shows something disturbing, like a beheading.)</p><p>Freelance workers, known informally as turkers, race to grab and do the tasks, providing what Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, once called \"artificial artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Most tasks pay a dime or less, and there is a daily churn of tasks that pay only a penny.</p><p>And the weird thing is that workers - mostly American workers - will do them, for many different reasons.</p><p>People turk to save for a motorcycle. They turk to buy insulin. They turk to pay off debt or pass the time profitably while on the clock at a boring job.</p><p>Some do it because there are few decent-paying jobs that can be done at will. People who are confined to their homes by disability or social anxiety or who live where there are few jobs do it because, despite lousy wages, it seems like the best option.</p><p>Plenty turk full time. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 3,000 American turkers, a quarter said they made most or all of their earned income on the platform. More than half the turkers surveyed said they earned under $5 an hour.</p><p>Fighting for pennies</p><p>As little as turking appears to pay on paper, in practice it often pays less because MTurk, as it is known, is a sloppy, shoddy free-for-all.</p><p>Turkers spend their time fighting requesters over an unfair 10-cent rejection or a missing 60-cent payment. They waste minutes filling out bubbles on defective questionnaires that cannot be submitted. They abandon \"10-minute\" surveys after half an hour.</p><p>They swap horror stories and warnings on turker message boards (\"rejection on a $0.50 hit,\" read one recent bulletin, \"reason is 'funds were not allocated' \"). They leave scathing reviews on the turker-run site Turkopticon (\"unfair and wild use of the rejection button\").</p><p>Just how much turkers make is the subject of considerable scholarly debate, but one paper published last year analyzed millions of tasks done by thousands of turkers. Though they probably overrepresented novice turkers like me who do the lowest-paying tasks, the paper's authors concluded that if you count time spent looking for tasks and working on tasks that came to nothing, the median turker's hourly wage was $1.77.</p><p>Only 4% of turkers, the researchers found, made more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour.</p><p>Presiding over this production is the world's biggest tech company, feet firmly planted on the sidelines. Amazon usually declines to get involved when turkers say requesters rip them off, even as it lets requesters hide behind aliases that can make them impossible to track down.</p><p>It has ignored turkers' pleas to mandate higher wages, even as it takes a cut of each transaction ranging from 17% to 50%; a requester posting a 1-cent HIT pays one penny to the turker and another to Amazon.</p><p>Amazon even finds ways to recoup some of the pennies turkers earn, a reminder of the days when miners were paid in scrip redeemable only at the company store. While American turkers can get their wages direct-deposited, thousands of turkers overseas have only one way to get paid without incurring third-party fees: on an Amazon gift card.</p><p>While Amazon pays all of its American employees at least $15 an hour and favors raising the minimum wage, it declined numerous requests to comment about the pay policy for turkers or anything else regarding Mechanical Turk. Minimum-wage laws generally do not apply to piecework jobs like turking.</p><p>Mechanical Turk is now one of a handful of big players in the field known as crowdwork or microwork. (One crowdwork company, Prolific, used by academic researchers, enforces a minimum wage: $6.50 an hour.)</p><p>Crowdwork's proponents see a gleaming future - a borderless, no-overhead labor market where task-creator and task-doer meet at the intersection of supply and demand. Its critics see a throwback to something more Dickensian, where the lack of regulation and accountability keeps workers in the dark and on the defensive.</p><p>Mechanical Turk, in particular, combines the inconsistency and precariousness of gig work with Big Tech's tendency to dodge liability for the icky things that happen on its platforms.</p><p>\"This is a great little microcosm of what happens when you take away any rules and the wages fall to the bottom,\" said Kristy Milland, a former turker turned labor activist who was one of the authors of the paper that analyzed turkers' earnings.</p><p>The bottom was where I dwelled during my brief tenure as a turker.</p><p>I tagged blurry, surveillance-looking photos of construction workers on job sites according to whether they were wearing hard hats or harnesses (1 cent per photo).</p><p>I helped train a virtual paralegal by describing a hypothetical injury claim (\"I suffered a serious injury because a defect in my lawn mower caused it to start\") but earned nothing because the \"submit\" box never popped up.</p><p>I imagined myself as an \"active investor\" and rated the prospect of my supporting a Kickstarter for a device that makes nut milk \"extremely likely.\"</p><p>Over the course of several weeks in September, I completed 221 HITs in a little over eight hours of dedicated turking, and earned a grand total of $7.83. That works out to 97 cents an hour.</p><p>But hourly wages are not everything. Jane Lamont, a 30-year-old call center worker in Louisville, quit her $7.25-an-hour second job at McDonald's to turk.</p><p>She works from 7 to 11 on weeknights, five or six hours a day on weekends, and typically makes $5 a day.</p><p>While the pay is \"really low,\" she said, she prefers turking to fast food for its freedom - freedom from having to wear a uniform, freedom to spend time at home with her mother, freedom to watch videos between tasks.</p><p>Katie Boehm of Pittsburgh turned to turking in 2017 after her husband, who has diabetes, lost his job and insurance coverage. Her own health issues keep her from working outside the house, and turking seemed like a lifeline.</p><p>She turks at least 50 hours a week, sets herself a minimum goal of $20 a day and usually makes $30 to $50.</p><p>Her husband's insulin costs $1,500 a month. \"MTurk covers about half of what he needs to survive,\" Boehm, 40, said. \"Silly insulin.\"</p><p>Amazon claims a turking workforce of half a million, but independent researchers say the number of active turkers is smaller. An NYU data scientist who studies Mechanical Turk, Panos Ipeirotis, estimates that there are from 100,000 to 200,000 turkers, and that at any moment several thousand are doing tasks. The vast majority of turkers are believed to be in the United States - at least three-quarters, researchers say - with India a distant second.</p><p>Mechanical Turk was created to solve an in-house problem. In 2001, looking for help weeding out duplicate product listings, Amazon applied for a patent for \"a hybrid machine/human computing arrangement which advantageously involves humans to assist a computer to solve particular tasks.\"</p><p>The name was an homage to a contraption built by a Hungarian nobleman, featuring a bearded mannequin in a turban, that dazzled Europe with its chess-playing expertise. The moves were actually executed by a magnet-wielding human hidden beneath the board.</p><p>Mechanical Turk opened to the public in 2005 with considerable fanfare. \"Market forces will define how effective it is for requesters and how lucrative it is for workers,\" an Amazon executive, Peter Cohen, said at the time.</p><p>Many major corporations have availed themselves of Mechanical Turk. The New York Times Co. has used turkers for at least three data projects.</p><p>MTurk also has big fans in the social sciences. Over 50,000 academic studies are conducted using MTurk each year, according to Leib Litman, a founder of CloudResearch, a company that helps researchers use the platform.</p><p>Turking is not always so low-paying. The most proficient turkers make upward of $12 an hour, using computer scripts and free tools like HIT Catcher and HIT Forker to beat their fellow turkers to the sweetest HITs and racking up special qualifications that open the door to higher pay.</p><p>Litman said that a small cadre of super-turkers actually do most of the tasks on MTurk and estimated that the average wage for turkers who take part in studies run with CloudResearch at $6.50 an hour.</p><p>Amber Smoot is good at turking. She sits on the porch of her future in-laws' house in Middleburg, Fla., and runs HIT Forker in the background while she watches her dogs play.</p><p>When the script catches a task that pays a dollar or more, her computer blasts a snippet of operatic rock and she grabs the HIT and sets it aside until she has a bunch. \"I'll queue 'em up and kick 'em all out,\" she said.</p><p>Smoot, 32, doesn't depend on MTurk to survive, but she knows that many people do. She spends a lot of time on message boards that offer tips to rookies.</p><p>\"I love MTurk and I love the opportunities it gives people - it's great for what it is, a side gig,\" she said. \"But the state of America is that people are turning to something that shouldn't be a job and trying to make a living off it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-675161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVN-95F1-JBM5-P2HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Dazu stehe der Online-Detailhandelsriese in Gespr\u00e4chen mit verschiedenen Finanzinstituten, darunter die US-Bank JP Morgan Chase. Dies meldet die US-Wirtschaftszeitung \u00abWall Street Journal\u00bb. Dabei ziele Amazon vor allem auf junge Kunden und Personen, die bisher keine Bankverbindung h\u00e4tten. Die Initiative befinde sich aber in einem fr\u00fchen Stadium und k\u00f6nne noch scheitern, hiess es weiter.

Die \u00abBig Tech\u00bb-Konzerne k\u00f6nnten mit ihren Datensammlungen weitere Branchen auf den Kopf stellen, erwartet J\u00fcrgen Rogg, Partner bei der Beratungsgesellschaft Boston Consulting Group (BCG). In China werde der Finanzmarkt bereits komplett umgekrempelt. Konzerne wir Alibaba verb\u00fcnden hier beispielsweise verschiedene Dienstleistungen intuitiv mit Banking, sagt Rogg. Auch in westlichen L\u00e4ndern d\u00fcrften Technologiekonzerne mittelfristig zunehmend in den Finanzdienstleistungssektor einbrechen. Konzerne wie Google, Apple oder Facebook verf\u00fcgten schliesslich bereits \u00fcber Lizenzen als Finanzdienstleister oder Finanzapplikationen.</p><p>Die Finanzinstitute haben gegen\u00fcber den Technologiekonzernen bei den Kunden einen Vertrauensvorsprung, wie eine Studie der Beratungsgesellschaft Oliver Wyman zeigt. Allerdings beliefern Letztere den Finanzsektor mit wichtigen Technologien und Infrastruktur, so dass ihre Bedeutung steigt. Die Zukunft k\u00f6nnte mehr Plattform-Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle bringen, bei denen Banken Verbindungen mit anderen Firmen eingehen. Als Katalysator hierf\u00fcr gelten unter anderem regulatorische Entwicklungen wie die europ\u00e4ische Zahlungsdienste-Richtlinie PSD2.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZZ-issueINZZ20180308article0229791809</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTM-XF81-JDRR-B2TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12122</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 AG f\u00fcr Die Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung NZZ Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Internationale Ausgabe) &amp;

First, if you're a Prime subscriber, we'd love to hear what you think. Please take our quick survey here.[1] What a week it's been for Amazon. The company accustomed to being slobbered over by local municipalities got a cold welcome when it tried to expand to New York City, and ended up pulling out. </p><p>It was another sign that the public's goodwill toward big tech is fading.  Amazon's business will be just fine without New York City. But more crucial to its business, and less publicly, it's trying to become the third player in digital advertising behind Google and Facebook. Advertisers have found it tough[2] to parse all Amazon's ad formats, though. Amazon's latest attempt to expand its ad business, with video search ads, is running into obstacles with advertisers. As Lauren Johnson reported last week[3], advertisers have issues with the price, creative demands, and data limitations. \"It's not something that we have clients clamoring for,\" Nich Weinheimer, VP of e-commerce at Kenshoo, a company that helps marketers plan and buy digital ads. That kind of challenge is giving rise to tech companies that are emerging to help marketers leverage Amazon, Tanya Dua reported[4]. Amazon needs to get formats like this one right if it's going to expand beyond performance ads. -- Lucia Thanks for subscribing. If you got this newsletter forwarded, sign up for your own here[5].

Instagram is already running out of room for ads, and that's a threat to Facebook as it looks for new avenues to keep revenue growing[7] Speaking of growing pains, Facebook is running up against a wall growing Instagram. The app was supposed to be the savior of Facebook's ad business, but it's already getting saturated with ads itself. The New York Times has more subs than ever. That's not necessarily good news for the rest of the industry.[8] I talked to Meredith Levien, COO of The New York Times Co., on the heels of a strong fourth quarter for subscription growth. But while the Times has many reasons to be optimistic about its ability to keep growing subscriptions, it's less clear that other subscription publishers can replicate that success. Pay TV distributors are looking to new video packages after another disastrous quarter, and it might be their only option[9] Cable companies are running out of ways to hold on to cord-cutting subscribers, which is why one trend on the horizon could be bundling themed content in niche entertainment interest areas like kids and Bollywood. That's according to Amdocs, which works with MVPDs like Comcast, AT... DirecTV, and Dish and is talking to clients about offering packages like this in the US in the months ahead. Giant brands like Unilever and Marriott are taking more of their advertising in-house than ever before, and a whole new cottage industry of companies is trying to cash in on the opportunity[10] Disruption creates all kinds of pains and opportunities. As more marketers try to bring their advertising in-house, some are getting help from new companies that have emerged to help them figure out how to cut out the agency middleman. BuzzFeed cut 15% of its staff, and some critics are now taking shots at CEO Jonah Peretti's strategy[11] BuzzFeed represented soaring hopes that online media operators could reinvent the news model for digital, but since it had to lay off staff to get profitable, some in and outside the company are questioning decisions made under CEO Jonah Peretti, from its ballooning staff to aggressive overseas expansion to rejecting a reported offer from Disney.

But they're indicative of the mounting challenges the e-commerce giant faces as it grows ever larger and more dominant. </p><p>Amazon's turn in the spotlight is a natural consequence of its prominence in retail, entertainment and internet infrastructure, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. \"As you get bigger and more successful, you have more of a target on your back,\" he said. </p><p>Few analysts believe Thursday's reversal in New York or the previous week's dust-up with the publisher of the National Enquirer will have much impact on consumer enthusiasm for Amazon's broad product selection and services or its fast shipping. Bezos has accused the Enquirer of \"extortion and blackmail\" for threatening to disclose revealing personal photos. </p><p>Investors don't appear particularly concerned that these issues will distract the hard-driving Bezos, who is also in the midst of a divorce - generally considered one of life's most stressful events. Even if Bezos were to find his attention otherwise occupied, Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente notes that the Amazon chief has a trusted senior leadership team in place. \"That gives investors comfort,\" he said. </p><p>Public anger at tech companies has been growing for some time, but much of it has been focused on Facebook and other tech companies that collect vast amounts of personal user information for targeting online ads and other purposes. </p><p>Facebook's privacy issues have been particularly acute since they involve the company's core business, said Paul Argenti, a Dartmouth College professor of corporate communication. Amazon isn't immune to the tech backlash. But Argenti said the company's popularity with consumers won't likely be affected by recent headlines. </p><p>\"I'm not going to stop ordering my movies and packages from them, and I think that's the way most people will look at it,\" he said. </p><p>Longer-term issues, however, could present a more serious threat. Amazon's New York investment would have put 25,000 jobs in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, at a cost of nearly $3 billion in tax breaks. Local activists called that a corporate giveaway, one made even less palatable by Amazon's anti-union stance. </p><p>That grass-roots rebellion suggests that people are growing more skeptical of big tech companies, especially when government is cutting them special deals, said Blair Levin, a policy adviser to New Street Research and a former chief of staff to a Federal Communications Commission chairman. </p><p>\"Time and time again, the public has seen promises made and reality is different,\" he said. </p><p>\"So they're going to be skeptical of Amazon. And it's across the board, not just Amazon.\" </p><p>Several European nations are also investigating Amazon's alleged anti-competitive activity. On Thursday, Austria's antitrust agency said it is reviewing complaints that the company is favoring its own products and discriminating against other sellers on its e-commerce site. German antitrust authorities and the European Commission are investigating Amazon for similar claims. </p><p>In the U.S., politicians are also speaking out against Amazon's practices, said Barry Lynn, executive director of Open Markets, an institution that studies corporate monopolies in the U.S. </p><p>Lynn argues that Amazon is a monopoly that should be more heavily regulated by the government. He pointed to comments Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president, made last year about Amazon's \"anti-competitive\" practices. </p><p>\"The word is out, the discussion is ongoing,\" Lynn said. \"It's not going to go away; it's only going to get louder.\" </p><p>But for shoppers, everything is business as usual, and the bad news will quickly blow over, Dartmouth's Argenti said. </p><p>\"We won't be talking about this a year from now, maybe not even a month from now,\" he said. </p><p>Lerman and Anderson write for Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0091195016</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF8-GGG1-DY37-F3B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Instead, Amazon declared on Thursday the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">largest profit in its history</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a bit awkward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Companies are supposed to make money, for sure. But this comes at a moment when politicians and the public are wondering if America\u2019s digital superstars are so powerful \u2014 and perhaps, tilt the game to their advantage \u2014 that they simply can\u2019t be beaten.</p><p>A company like Amazon planning to lose money and instead making billions of dollars in profit is a pretty compelling sign of dominance.</p><p>This week in technology made me think of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">that old line</url> about a once dominant car company: What\u2019s good for the United States was good for General Motors, and what was good for GM was good for the country. (There\u2019s a debate about what the GM executive meant by this, but it\u2019s still a good line. Stay with me.)</p><p>The bosses of four of America\u2019s tech giants, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">dragged (virtually) in front of Congress this week</url>, said some version of that old saw. They said that their successes are uniquely American, and that their companies enrich the country and the lives of people who live in it.</p><p>That\u2019s true. It is, however, hard to ignore that the fortunes of the country and its leading corporate citizens are currently going in opposite directions.</p><p>We learned on Thursday that the United States <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">wiped out five years of economic growth in a matter of months</url>, as my colleague Ben Casselman put it. During that period, Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">mostly raked in money hand over fist</url>.</p><p>Mostly, this makes sense. During a pandemic, we have needed the products and services these companies provide. That does not, however, guarantee them financial success.</p><p>(Read more: Last year, my colleague Kashmir Hill wrote about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">trying and mostly failing</url> to cut the five big U.S. technology companies out of her life. Now, Kash is reflecting on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">what she learned from that experiment</url>.)</p><p>Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg said a few months ago that the way his company makes money \u2014 selling ads to a local bakery or an online luggage maker \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">tends to naturally rise and fall</url> in tune with the economy. That\u2019s generally true, but not right now. The economy is tanking at its worst rate in many decades. Facebook\u2019s advertising sales are fine.</p><p>What has been bad for the United States hasn\u2019t yet been bad for Big Tech. Is, then, what\u2019s good for Big Tech good for the country? I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>There\u2019s an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">axiom</url> in technology that change happens gradually, then suddenly. Tech companies can seem unbeatable until they aren\u2019t \u2014 often because of some rapid evolutionary change. It happened to Nokia and Sun Microsystems \u2014 whose old headquarters was taken over by Facebook in a symbol of one empire replacing a crumbled one.</p><p>So could there be a Fall of Rome moment for today\u2019s tech superpowers? Yes, in theory, and we might never see it coming. Right now, though, despite broader economic pains and a growing backlash to their power, these four American tech superpowers appear to be as close to invulnerable as you can get.</p><p>Your Take</p><p>We\u2019ve spent a lot of time this week talking about the congressional antitrust hearing and potential abuses of power by Big Tech.

(My colleague Cecilia Kang <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">talked about this on The Daily.</url>)</p><p>There are, however, at least a couple of examples in which tech companies are being accused of behavior that has led to higher sticker prices for us. In other words, there are conventional, railroad-baron-type antitrust claims against the tech giants, too.</p><p>These instances didn\u2019t get much of an airing during the congressional hearing this week into tech company power, but they\u2019re worth paying attention to.</p><p>One issue involves Apple\u2019s App Store. A lawsuit that is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">winding its way through U.S. courts</url> claims that Apple\u2019s commission of as much as 30 percent on digital app transactions makes all iPhone apps more expensive than they would be without Apple\u2019s monopoly over iPhone app distribution.</p><p>Another involves Amazon\u2019s marketplace.

For Jio\u2019s American investors, it ties their fortunes in the booming Indian market \u2014 arguably the most promising outside China \u2014 to the country\u2019s most powerful tycoon.</p><p>Jio \u201cis the most ambitious company I have ever seen\u201d, said one person familiar with the deals. \u201cIt\u2019s Vodafone, plus Tencent, plus a [handset] maker\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Very rarely do you make the transition to being a great technologist, but they have managed to do that.\u201d</p><p>Separately, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund is in talks with Jio to invest about $1.5bn, a person familiar with the discussions said. PIF declined to comment. </p><p>Since inheriting his father\u2019s oil products business in 2005, Mr Ambani has pushed Reliance Industries into retail, telecoms and technology from streaming and payments to ecommerce. Mr Ambani said he would spin off and list Jio within five years.</p><p>Robert Smith, Vista\u2019s founder and chairman, said that Jio was poised to propel a wave of internet adoption among Indian consumers and small businesses. \u201cMukesh Ambani\u2019s vision for a digital transformation of India\u2019s economy is being brought to life through the power of Jio\u2019s platform.\u201d </p><p>Reliance bet early that its newer ventures, rather than its legacy oil and chemicals businesses, would drive future growth, said another person familiar with Jio\u2019s strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s a great shift in terms of where the value will come from, and where the market expects to see value going forward.\u201d</p><p>With Mr Ambani\u2019s core energy businesses facing a protracted global downturn, that digital diversification looks ever more prescient. He is under pressure to show he can bring his newer ventures to maturity, deliver deals to generate cash and ease Reliance\u2019s debt burden. Mr Ambani has vowed to cut net debt of more than $20bn to zero within a year.</p><p>Reliance\u2019s energy businesses, which still produce the bulk of revenues and have funded its Big Tech push, are under strain from coronavirus-induced turmoil in global oil markets.</p><p>A 75 per cent drop in crude prices between January and March forced it to write off more than $500m of inventory and register its biggest drop in net profit in more than a decade. Lockdowns are crushing demand both for its fuels and its petrochemicals, prompting temporary pay cuts for employees and executives.</p><p>The pain is likely to intensify, with an expected collapse in economic growth this year set to sap energy demand. This has complicated a crucial part of Reliance\u2019s strategy: a proposed agreement for Saudi Aramco to take a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95ee8b64-bd1a-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\"> 20 per cent stake</url> in Reliance\u2019s energy businesses for roughly $15bn.</p><p>Analysts have questioned whether the deal will close, given the oil price collapse. One person briefed on the negotiations said the hit to the Saudi state giant\u2019s earnings had fuelled reservations about the agreement, noting that \u201cthe Aramco deal is still not settled\u201d. Reliance said the deal was on track, with due diligence under way.</p><p>This has added urgency to Reliance\u2019s other fundraising avenues, with the company saying last month that it would raise $7bn through a rights issue, India\u2019s largest ever. Despite a 7 per cent drop last week ahead of the planned share sale, its stock is up more than 60 per cent since late March. The shares closed 1.6 per cent higher on Friday.</p><p>Reliance has also courted international investors to buy stakes in its fibre and tower assets, which it has spun into investment trusts. Canadian asset manager Brookfield has agreed a $3.3bn deal to acquire the masts business, and Reliance said talks over the fibre assets \u201care at an advanced stage\u201d.</p><p>For Jio\u2019s new US investors, the young company presents a growth opportunity hard to replicate elsewhere. Since launching in 2016, Jio has attracted 388m users \u2014 more than the entire US population \u2014 thanks to its ultra-cheap mobile contracts and enticing promotional offers.</p><p>It last month partnered its new grocery ecommerce service with Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, which has 400m users in India, giving it unrivalled reach among consumers.</p><p>\u201cThe courage it takes to spend $40bn to build an IT network, all 4G, a business model that gives away voice calling for free and then provide an increasing suite of digital services on top of it,\u201d said one of the people familiar with Jio\u2019s strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important company in India.\u201d</p><p>In Mr Ambani, the new investors will also enjoy a valuable ally in what can be a tricky market for foreign businesses. Facebook, in particular, has frequently bumped up against Indian authorities, with a pending data protection bill promising strict rules and its budding WhatsApp payment service held up by regulators for two years. In ecommerce, tech giants such as Amazon have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dd8188a-14c2-11e9-a581-4ff78404524e\"> faced restrictions</url> that do not apply to domestic businesses such as Reliance.</p><p>\u201cBecause [Mr Ambani] is so powerful, you\u2019d rather keep [him] as a partner than as a competitor,\u201d said one Mumbai-based executive.</p><p>Reliance said its digital strategy was being vindicated, with its newer units uniquely positioned to thrive even as the virus emergency upends other business models. It said data traffic had risen since India entered lockdown in late March, and it had launched a foray into fast-growing areas such as videoconferencing.</p><p>Industry observers said there were few precedents of companies pulling off such radical changes in strategy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to figure out whether a telco has built a big ecommerce play, or an oil and gas company has tried to reposition itself on the consumer side and take on players like Amazon,\u201d said Bernstein\u2019s Rahul Malhotra. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find even small examples of what Reliance is building.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Simeon Kerr</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f2f55a6c83504de3ae27c8e8fdbcd482</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXP-T3P1-DXP9-91Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 18, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0003NV7</classCode><className>RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000CUZ3</classCode><className>VISTA EQUITY PARTNERS LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS313110 FIBER, YARN &amp;

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French competition authority, which is enforcing a european commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. and in the united States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said danielle coffey, the general counsel for the news Media alliance, which largely represents u.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled news corp - born in australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox news's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that news corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the american media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. and even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"all governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last october writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant news corp ceo, robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" and publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. and while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a news corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) and Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. and, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge european regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google news from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\" now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the united States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the united States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of news corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, alphabet.</p><p>The european copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. de Silva says Google has until august \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. at worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the united States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News. Before that, he covered politics for Politico, The New York Daily News, The New York Observer and The New York Sun. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de silva, the president of the French Competition authority, which is enforcing a european Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. and in the United states, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the news Media alliance, which largely represents U.s. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled news Corp - born in australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox news's airwaves. (sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that news Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the american media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. and even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"all governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last october writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant news Corp Ceo, robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" and publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former salon executive, richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. and while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a news Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) and Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. and, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge european regulation when, in spain in 2014, they simply removed Google news from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\" now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United states, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United states and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of news Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, alphabet.</p><p>The european copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. de silva says Google has until august \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July. sims and de silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. at worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United states.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled News Corp - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the American media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled News Corp - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the American media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled News Corp - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the American media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled News Corp - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the American media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled News Corp - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the American media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p>But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p>\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favour of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bareknuckled News Corp - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News's airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the American media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers'business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing cheques in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as though the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators'demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneouvre in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the United States, and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the United States and France to pay directly to \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favour of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp, said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the United States.</p><p>The New York Times Ben Smith is the media columnist. He joined The Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.

It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p>But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p>\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: The National Post obtained provisional death statistics for two of the four largest and hardest-hit provinces. Statistics Canada plans to release its own tabulation of such numbers on Wednesday. B.C. had earlier released the number of excess deaths since the pandemic started. Ontario's death statistics are currently available only up until 2017, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.</p><p>Quebec's Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity Ministry provided figures for this March and April, as well as the same two months in each of the prior three years.</p><p>There were 6,349 deaths in March, 214 or 3.5 per cent more than the average for 2017 to 2019.</p><p>The ministry recorded 7,662 deaths this April, which is 2,008 or 35.5 per cent above the average for the previous three years.</p><p>The figures for this year represent the number of death certificates received by the agency that month, meaning some deaths could have occurred earlier. But it's also possible some April deaths were not recorded then.</p><p>Quebec's population growth might account for some of the change, though it increased by only 2.2 per cent from 2017-2019.</p><p>Alberta divulged statistics on the number of deaths per 100,000 residents between January and April, which includes two months in which there were relatively few cases and deaths from COVID-19.</p><p>The province recorded 207 overall deaths per 100,000 for the first four months of this year - about 9,100 - versus an average of 204.1 per 100,000 in each of the five years before that. One of those years, 2018, actually had more deaths during the four months than 2020.</p><p>Alberta has recorded 118 COVID-19 deaths so far. B.C. did not provide monthly or quarterly statistics by deadline, but on May 4 it reported there had been an excess of 170 overall deaths on top of what would be expected, with at least 111 of those attributed to COVID-19.</p><p>More detailed mortality numbers, outlining the age and location of the deceased, are needed to properly analyze the statistics, but it seems clear what is behind the increases, said Sam Harper, an epidemiology professor at McGill University.</p><p>\"We know that the epidemic is much worse in Quebec than it has been in other provinces,\" he said. \"It is safe to assume that many if not most of these excess deaths are due to COVID-19, either directly or indirectly.\"</p><p>The overall mortality statistics in some countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., have actually pointed to there being large numbers of COVID-19 deaths not captured in the official data for various reasons.</p><p>But the preliminary figures released now by some provinces suggest that Canada's COVID statistics have missed few victims of the virus, said Jha.</p><p>\"It's broadly consistent with the idea that there is not a vast undercount of deaths,\" he said.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just voted unanimously to launch a low power 5G[1] network across the U.S. This is great news! 5G is the gateway to the America 2.0[2] present and future. 5G tech will enable the revolution of connected cars, EVs[3] and robotaxis for big players like Uber and Tesla by 2025. Let's face it, this where 5G really counts for us. </p><p>The potential stock gains for this driverless revolution will be HUGE.

[embedded content] Don't forget: You can follow me on Twitter at @ALancasterGuru[7]. I post breaking developments in America 2.0, fascinating macro-economic data as well as news and stats that pique my interest and I'm sure yours too. Happy Monday! Let's dive right into the 3 big tech developments in America 2.0 with a focus on the 5G revolution[8], 3D Printing innovation[9] and New Energy &amp;#38; Solar[10] breakthroughs.The 5G Revolution is HereT-Mobile and AT&amp;#38;T are on track in the deployment of 5G. Bloomberg Intelligence data is showing that both carriers will attain near-nationwide coverage by year-end. T-Mobile is the leader so far with 5G service deployed to 200 million people in December 2019. And as this U.S. map shows AT&amp;#38;T &amp;#38; Verizon are making progress, though AT&amp;#38;T is outpacing Verizon in City 5G mobility deployment by nearly 6-to-1.As of April 24, 2020, AT&amp;#38;T has Mobile 5G deployed in 201 cities while Verizon is in 34. If you're an AT&amp;#38;T customer here's a scrolling list of the 201 cities where mobile 5G is now present. You can check out this Marco Monday video[11] link anytime to read the listed cities in your state when they appear in the scrolling list. Major Cities in Alabama through Kansas and Kentucky through Wisconsin are noted. But what does this 5G deployment mean for you? Well, this past week I posted this article on my twitter page: The 5G revolution just got a major green light.The 5G Revolution just got a major green light. Yesterday, the FCC voted unanimously 'to launch a low-power #5G[12] network across the U.S.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/HhqBGjBnNx\">https://t.co/HhqBGjBnNx</url>[13] \u2014 Amber Lancaster (@ALancasterGuru) April 21, 2020[14]On April 20, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously on Monday to launch a low power 5G network across the U.S. As you probably know we here at Bold Profits[15] talk a lot about how 5G is the gateway to the America 2.0[16] present and future. 5G tech will enable the revolution of connected cars. Ericsson, a networking telecom co. forecasts that by 2025, almost every single new car will be connected to wireless 5g internet. But where 5G really counts and let's face it, where potential stock gains can be made is in the revolution of Autonomous self-driving cars right on our local streets. These cars specifically EVs or electric vehicles and robotaxis are in the works by tech innovators like Tesla &amp;#38; Uber. A couple of weeks ago as reported by Electrek, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's robotaxi plan is still on for this year- pending regulatory approval. 3D Printing is BoundlessFrom Dresses to Shoes and Buildings to Motorcycles! So much can be made through 3D printing tech[17].And 3D printing now more than ever is being used in America 2.0 manufacturing and production, case in point Tesla. Just reported on April 23 by 3D Printing Media network, Tesla may have turned to 3D printing to address supply chain delay issues due to the virus. Because it appears certain parts for the brand-new just launched Model Y couldn't be delivered in time due to the pandemic disruptions, it looks like Tesla turned to 3D printing tech to fill the void.Instead of spending up to $500K and 8-weeks to manually design &amp;#38; manufacture a mold of the needed part, a new video shows how the Model Y HVAC system integrates partly 3D-printed parts saving time and money. Simply put, 3D printing technology offers a state-of-the-art viable solution to mass-print products fast, economically, effectively and efficiently.Renewable Ideas Shaping The FutureEveryone knows about how solar energy is an alternative energy source to power our homes via roof solar panels but make way for this solar power breakthrough. Solar driveways.That's right, a new solar driveway concept could power an entire household for 1-year. And it doesn't stop there, publicly traded and leading U.S. renewables developer NextEra Energy just announced they see no drop-off, nor slow-down in renewable energy market growth.NextEra specializes in the generation of electricity through wind &amp;#38; solar. According to Greentech media, 'NextEra expects to build around 5 gigawatts of renewables capacity this year, and it added another 1.6 gigawatts of wind, solar and storage to its pipeline during the first quarter of 2020. None of its 2020 projects are expected to be delayed.' [1] This just continues to prove that solar is the new mega new energy source i[18]n the making and a consummate America 2.0 mega trend. Until next time,Amber Lancaster[19] Director of Investment Research, Banyan Hill Publishing P.S. In today's Macro Monday I told you about a new solar driveway \u2014 one clue that the renewable energy market is booming.

I told him that we fight with corruption.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: The Ukrainian president fights back against Trump's charges of corruption and opens up for the first time on television about getting caught in what he calls the impeachment soap opera.</p><p>Plus --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything that is admirable about Amazon is also something that we should fear about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: A new PBS documentary investigates the retail juggernaut re- shaping our world.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>While a crowded field of Democrats make their pitch to voters in Nevada next, Senator Bernie Sanders seems to be breaking away from the pack, as his progressive base continues to turn out in force and the moderate vote remains split. Among adding to competition, the former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg's sudden rise in the national polls. So, who will unite the Democrats to fight Trump?</p><p>It's a key question for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who masterminded the Democrats winning strategy for the 2018 midterms. We sat down for an exclusive interview at the Munich Security Conference to discuss the election and why she says the U.S. cannot afford another Trump term. She also saw her trip to Europe as an effort to talk up the Transatlantic Alliance, despite Trump's America first policy. Here's our conversation.</p><p>Speaker Pelosi, welcome to the program.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): My pleasure to be here.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, the title of this Munich Security Conference is Westlessness. In itself, it's a pretty big dig. I wonder if it's a dig at the whole West? Is it a dig at the United States under this administration? What do you take from that title?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, what I take from the title is we need to reassure the world that Western values are alive and well and that the unity that we have is real. We have one of the largest delegations ever, bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House, large delegation to say we're for multilateralism, our commitment to NATO is ironclad, and that is our message of unity with Western Europe.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, opening the conference, the president of Germany, where we are right now, criticized the United States for, as he put it, neglecting its international duties, and he warned of a \"increasingly destructive dynamic in world politics.\" I mean, he's not pulling his punches.</p><p>PELOSI: Well, I have -- this is the third speech by the German president that I've heard in recent weeks, while yesterday's presentation was very powerful. And some -- perhaps some elements of truth as to his attitude toward it, but I see everything as an opportunity and we see this as our opportunity to say we are committed to multilateralism and the Transatlantic Alliance, even though there may be some other voices in the U.S. that may raise some doubts.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you're trying to reassure traditional allies of the traditional alliance and multilateralism. I wonder what you make of Secretary of State Pompeo who also spoke and he said, you know, reports of the death of the Transatlantic Alliance are grossly overexaggerated.</p><p>PELOSI: I agree. And so, that was, hopefully, I believe, a sincere statement, don't take certain things with more weight than what I'm saying here today.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's interesting, because you feel a little bit of a change, the top diplomat of the United States coming here and saying that to Europeans at a title called Westlessness. It is interesting. But at the same time, we read -- and of course, you know this better than I do, the administration, the White House, is threatening to cut foreign aid, for instance, this foreign aid budget and its international budget by about 21 percent, if I'm not mistaken.</p><p>What signal does that send? I mean, on the one hand, it's all alive and well, this Transatlantic experience, but we're cutting a lot of meat and potatoes?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, let me assert the role of Congress in both situations. Here, the Trump administration is trying to give a comfort level to statements that were made by the president. And we are here, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, to say our commitment to NATO is ironclad, I repeat.</p><p>[13:05:00]</p><p>In terms of the budget, the Congress will weigh in on it. They've cut $10 billion when you talk about development assistance, when you talk about climate crisis. Name any subject, it's cut and they're including CDC by 19 percent of their budget, which is the agency to fight the coronavirus. So, it doesn't make sense. But I do believe there will be bipartisan support, House and Senate, to get rid of most of those cuts. Hopefully all of them and perhaps have some increases, because the soft power of our diplomacy is very important in keeping the peace.</p><p>And that's our first responsibility, to protect and defend the American people. Certainly, to be strong militarily, but also to alleviate poverty, eradicate disease, invest in development and end the fury of despair that exist in some places that can cause violence.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And of course, the president of Ukraine has been speaking and I've spoken to him and there was a bipartisan delegation that went to Kiev to re-state America's strong support for Ukraine.</p><p>PELOSI: Yes. Yesterday.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Of course, he's been caught up in the whole impeachment drama. The Senate has said, let's move past impeachment and get really down to the nitty-gritty of supporting Ukraine, it's very important for Europe, for the United States, for everything.</p><p>PELOSI: Well, we all -- that was the bipartisan appropriation, was to give that assistance to the Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. That money now has gone. It would not have gone when it did without the whistle-blower. But not to get too bogged down in the past, the support that we have for Ukraine is in our national security interest and what the president did was undermining our national security.</p><p>AMANPOUR: When you say not to get too bogged down in the past, do you believe that you, the country, is past this impeachment, now that the acquittal has happened, that you are moving on?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, the president may have been acquitted by the Senate which didn't have the courage to honor its oath of office on the Republican side, but he will never be vindicated from this. The other part of that is that we will continue to honor our oath of office to protect and defend the constitution. So, we're in the courts to fight any assault on the constitution from the administration. That doesn't relate to impeachment, it just relates to honoring the constitution. But that's more of an issue for at home.</p><p>We have been working, we have 275 bipartisan bills on Mitch McConnell's desk. We wish he would take them up, whether it's gun violence, protection, this is a bullet I always wear that's very important --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Oh, is it?</p><p>PELOSI: -- in order for us to end gun violence in our country, whether it's equal pay for equal work, whether it's -- there's a long array of important initiatives, again, to protect our health care, which was our campaign promise. We said we were going to lower the cost of health care by lowering the cost of prescription drugs and we've passed that. That we're going to raise paychecks by building the infrastructure of America, and we're in the process of doing that. And that we had cleaner government.</p><p>I think on the first two we might get some support from the administration, lower health care, prescription drug costs, build the infrastructure. Cleaner government, I don't think there's any way.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, you've led me into my next question then, and that is the issue of the Department of Justice. As you know, obviously, because it involves the House, because I believe attorney general is coming to the House to testify at the end of March. Where does the House stand on the rule of law regarding the direct intervention, the president's and his attorney general's in trying to lower the sentences of friends of the president, whether it be Roger Stone or maybe even Michael Flynn?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, as you know, I don't criticize the president overseas. I state some facts. But the House will be -- we do have Attorney General Barr coming before the Congress at the end of March. That's when he can come. So, the Judiciary Committee is accommodating that. But the rule of law must be upheld. If we relax that, then we have lost everything. No one is above the law.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is the rule of law at risk even after the impeachment, after the acquittal? I mean, you know --</p><p>PELOSI: No.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No?</p><p>PELOSI: No. I mean, we have to uphold the rule of law. The president does not necessarily believe that, but, you know, again, I'll save that interview for when we're at home. But certainly, the president of the United States weighing in with a tweet on a case that directly involves him is not in keeping with the rule of law.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You gave me a lovely show and tell, an amazingly dramatic bracelet you have and sometimes I like to show pictures. This really was one for the ages.</p><p>[13:10:00]</p><p>PELOSI: It was on the front page of \"The New York Times.\" I didn't even see it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And everywhere. It went sort of viral.</p><p>PELOSI: You know, I saw it a lot of other places. Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to ask you, did Vice President Pence -- I mean, he's showing remarkable discipline by not looking at you. Did he say anything?</p><p>PELOSI: No, no. He may not have even known. He was just looking straight at the president. But the president -- again, I was very disappointed in the fact that the president used the chamber of the House of Representatives, the people's house as a backdrop for a reality show, doing some things that are not appropriate, including misrepresenting the facts. But in addition to that, giving the presidential medal to Rush Limbaugh. But that's something he should do in his own office.</p><p>We don't go over there and say, knock, knock, we've come to do our work in your office. He shouldn't be doing that in the House, especially something so inappropriate. Quite frankly, when he started talking about a person so respected in our country, diagnosed with cancer, we thought he was going to be talking about John Lewis. And even if he's talking about Rush Limbaugh - -</p><p>AMANPOUR: The great congressman civil rights leader.</p><p>PELOSI: Civil rights leader, yes. And even talking about Rush Limbaugh as being sick, he has our sympathy, but the medal of freedom, no. But in any event --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Did the president refuse to shake your hand?</p><p>PELOSI: He didn't shake it when I extended it. I don't know what you call that. But in any event, that had nothing to do with my tearing up the State of the Union Address. My tearing up had to do with I thought if I could find a page that doesn't have a falsehood on it, I'll spare it, but I couldn't find that.</p><p>I almost did when he had -- the soldier that was coming home that was so beautiful, but get back to the bottom of the page, and there he goes again.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I wonder whether it was the opening salvo in a new relationship with the White House or an opening salvo in an election campaign. I guess because the president himself is out and loud and proud about being, you know, antiestablishment and a self-declared disrupter. And the opposition, yourself and the others, have essentially, by and large, played by the rules. Now, you know there are members of your own party who thought you shouldn't have sunk to that level.</p><p>PELOSI: A few, a few.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>PELOSI: I mean, a few like to say that. But -- and they tell me what their wives think.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. So, that's what I'm asking you. Are you giving a signal that the Democrats will fight back hard, that you will not be constrained by what you believe to be insurgent behavior on the other side and that this is, you know, a time to go mano a mano?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, let me say this. I had no intention of doing that when we went to the State of the Union. That was well into a passive assertive. Now, I'm a speed reader, so I was reading ahead. I knew what was there.</p><p>And I got past like about a third of it and I thought, this is terrible. And (INAUDIBLE) on a couple of pages thinking I ought to remember what's on this page and on this page and then I realized that almost every page had something in it that was objectionable.</p><p>So, it wasn't a planned thing, but it was -- one of my disappointments is the fact that with all that we have done legislatively, whether it's equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage, gun violence protection, issues that relate to our children, the list goes on, climate action now, we have very little press on it. And it seems that if you want to get press, you have to get attention.</p><p>So, I thought well, let's get attention on the fact that what he said here today was not true. Now, I'm departing from my offshore -- not criticizing the president offshore. But when you ask about the -- I'm not talking about him personally. I'm just talking about his State of the Union Address.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I understand. What about, though, the fact that the president seems liberated -- and this is did democratic politics, so I'm not asking you to criticize here. But he was acquitted, his poll ratings are high --</p><p>PELOSI: There was no acquittal.</p><p>AMANPOUR: By the Senate.</p><p>PELOSI: You can't have an acquittal unless a trial. And you can't have a trial when you have witnesses and documents. So, he can say he's acquitted and the headlines can say acquitted but he's impeached forever, branded with that and not vindicated. And even the senators were saying, yes, it wasn't right. But they didn't have the courage to act upon that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Except for?</p><p>PELOSI: Except for Mitt Romney. God bless him. And then the president criticized him for using his faith to do something he knew was wrong. How could you -- well, I don't know if the president is a person of faith. It's not for me to make that judgement.</p><p>AMANPOUR: He criticized you about saying that you pray too as well.</p><p>PELOSI: He said I didn't pray for him. But I feel like if he's a person of faith he would recognize another person of faith. And if he prayed, he would recognize that other people do, even for him.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It seems that the individual who the president asked President Zelensky to investigate, that is Joe Biden, as his main opponent, I guess the president was concerned about that, seems not to be doing very well right now in the campaign.</p><p>[13:15:00]</p><p>Another victory for the president, if you like. And there seems to be a huge amount of hullabaloo in the Democratic Party about which is the most electable candidate, how -- if we want to remove the president in an election, how do we best do it? What do you think about this? I know you're not going to weigh in on behalf of any candidate, but where do you think you are as a party?</p><p>PELOSI: I think we're what the Democratic Party is, a party of vitality, differences of opinion, which we will resolve. I have trust in the American people. We -- let's see what the elections put forth. It isn't up to me to decide, it's up to the people.</p><p>And I'm excited. I think every one of our candidates, all 25 -- I don't know if Michael Bloomberg is candidate 25, but Michael Bloomberg, too, have made a very valuable contribution to the debate, putting forth their vision, their knowledge, their judgment, their strategic thinking of how to connect with the American people to have a better future for our country.</p><p>Easy to say any one of them would be a better president than the current occupant of the White House. But we want to do the very positive about how we go forward, and this is how you make those decisions. So, I'm grateful to all of them for putting themselves on the line, putting forth their ideas. And now, we come down to the winnowing process.</p><p>But I see everything as an opportunity and I see -- and quite frankly, with all the respect in the world for Iowa and New Hampshire, I'm not counting Joe Biden out. There's still races ahead that are much more representative of the country. And I'm long time -- you know, I was a state party chair, I've been chair of the Platform Committee, I've been chair of the Delegate Selection Committee, all of these things before I ever went to Congress. The platform was when I was in Congress. And again, the differences of opinion are what we are about. We're not a lockstep, take it from the top down, this is what it's going to be.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Are you worried about the Corbyn effect? Are you worried that if a very, you know, left of the party, just like in Britain, Jeremy Corbyn, took the party very far left and was crushed in the election?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, I don't -- that's a different scenario. We're not a parliamentary party. We have different views in the party. And I'll just remind that as speaker of the house, when I was leader, we had a very disciplined plan to win the Congress of the United States.</p><p>It was mobilization on the ground, don't yield one grain of sand to the other side for getting out the vote. Messaging, mainstream, right down the center, with a progressive agenda, but not menacing agenda. It was about lowering the cost of prediction drugs, building paychecks by building the infrastructure of America and cleaner government.</p><p>I'd say the first two, I think, we have a chance to unify with the president. Cleaner government, I don't think he has any interest. So, we -- and then third, we had attracted the financial resources. Mobilization, message, money, manage it well, the most important thing is that we had terrific candidates who were a good match for their districts and we thought -- and our engine continues, our impetus, our momentum continues from the last election. We're nonstop and we hoped that that would be kind of a model to the national to understand where we have to win the electoral college, where we have to retain and grow the House number and where we can win the United States Senate, as well as state and local elections.</p><p>So, I think that we've shown a path. Hopefully, we can get everyone on that path. As I say, I see everything as an opportunity, this refreshing vitality invigorates the party. But we know one thing, we have a better vision for America and we must defeat Donald Trump who does not share a vision that is about unity and unifying the country and making sure that everybody has a chance in our country and that no one is above the law, not even the president.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And very finally, you've been elected over and over and over again, and you said to me before the midterms, as long as he's there, i.e. President Trump, I'm here. Do you still --</p><p>PELOSI: Oh, my God.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is that still the case for you?</p><p>PELOSI: Oh, I can't even envision a situation where he would be reelected. But we are not -- we don't take anything for granted. As I say, he -- we have to have our own vision for the future. But everybody knows that we must be unified and making sure that he does not have a second term.</p><p>[13:20:00]</p><p>Our country is great. The American people are wonderful. We're a resilient country. We can withstand one term. But the destruction that he would do to the courts on our country and the environment where he says, I'm not going to use science as any basis for decisions on the environment, when he says Article 2 says I can do whatever I want, he must be defeated.</p><p>And again, I always say in the arena to our candidates, when you're in that arena -- and I say this to the women members, we're so proud to have so many, you know, 91 Democrats, you know, I say to them, when you're in the arena you have to be prepared to throw a punch because you have to be prepared to take a punch for the children.</p><p>AMANPOUR: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, thank you for joining me.</p><p>PELOSI: My pleasure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And tomorrow, I'll be speaking to Michael Bloomberg's senior campaign adviser, Timothy O'Brien.</p><p>Now, also in Munich, I spoke to the man at the center of the impeachment crisis, the president of Ukraine, of course, Volodymyr Zelensky. It's his first international TV interview since the infamous quid pro quo call. And at times he was emotional as he spoke about the collateral damage inflicted on his own country, when Ukraine needs all the support it can get to reverse Russia's occupation and annexation of Ukrainian territory. We spoke in front of a live audience and Mr. Zelensky switched between speaking in Ukrainian and English.</p><p>President Zelensky, welcome to the program.</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to say, look, your political journey, which you spoke about in your speech, is about as amazing as President Trump's. It's very, very unusual. He was a businessman, a very successful reality television host, very high ratings. You, yourself, have been a comedian and an actor and you played a president on a show in your homeland. Do you sometimes wish you had stayed in television?</p><p>ZELENSKY: I think many people will see my answer. Sometimes I think about that, right. Sometimes I think how my life has changed.</p><p>AMANPOUR: How much has this domestic American situation with the impeachment and the call to you affected your key aim of bringing people home and ending the war? How much has it affected your ability to focus on what you need to focus on?</p><p>ZELENSKY: In my previous life -- no, I mean, I was waiting this question, of course. I have many questions about impeachment everywhere. In my previous life, in my previous profession, I truly say when I was producer, screen writer and actor, I wanted to get Oscar. I wanted to be very popular in USA. Now, I'm very popular in USA.</p><p>But I didn't want to find such way. But -- you know, but if this way will help Ukraine, I'm ready for next call with Mr. Trump. Now, we have very good relationship with USA and I want to thank you guys and thank everybody and the president and USA, just ordinary American people, first of all, for support, support Ukraine. Especially now when we have war. Thank you for your help and applause to every American people.</p><p>We feel it. We feel it with our hearts, with our body, and I am always saying to everybody, saying to Europe, everybody help, but help more.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I know you've been asked a million times about quid pro quo and you say there wasn't a quid pro quo. But you have also talked about the necessity of having aid and for it not to be held up in any form or fashion. To the \"Time\" magazine and a bunch of others you said, we're at war. If you're our strategic partner then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness.</p><p>ZELENSKY (through translator): That's right. And you see now, there is no block and nobody blocks nothing. And at present, we are talking about a different level of military assistance and support. On the whole, this is a very substantial program for the (INAUDIBLE) and hundreds million U.S. dollars. So, this is the priority. One of the priorities.</p><p>[13:25:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: When you heard first that aid was being blocked, what went through your mind in terms of your fight against the Russians, in terms of your actual political, psychological, military position vis-a-vis a very strong opponent, and that is Vladimir Putin?</p><p>ZELENSKY (through translator): There was a tactical moment, we needed that aid. Tactically, we had to win to have an upper hand in this story and not to damage our relations with the United States.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You've said --</p><p>ZELENSKY: OK. OK. It's enough. It's enough.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You've said that you don't think Ukraine should be a chessboard of the big global players so that someone could toss us around, use us as cover as some part of a bargain. As for the U.S., I would really want them to help us, to understand us, to see that we are a player in our own right. Do you think you've achieved that now?</p><p>ZELENSKY (through translator): No. You put great questions this way or the other, asking about the impeachment topic.</p><p>AMANPOUR: This is about Ukraine as a chess player, as a chess piece.</p><p>ZELENSKY: No, no, no. Yes, I understood. I mean, the questions before, I mean the questions before. If we ask too many questions about this topic, then Ukraine is a chess player in this case.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Over the last period, something like 125,000 new Russian passports have been issued to people in the Donbass, in your Eastern Ukraine. I'm sure that doesn't thrill you. And I just want you to respond to something that President Obama said just before he left office in 2016. The fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do. Respond to that.</p><p>ZELENSKY (through translator): And you know, there is a portion of truth to everything and we talked about the direction of Ukraine to the European Union and on its way to the NATO. Our main objective is that our army complies with the NATO standards to be exceptionally strong. And my objective has always been as strong independent Ukraine, which can be in any union or alliance.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was very moved when you recalled the Budapest -- Bucharest -- is it Bucharest or Budapest?</p><p>ZELENSKY: Budapest.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Thank you. Memorandum of 1994. In other words, your country as part of the Soviet Union had the world's third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and you gave them up. In return, including from Russia, for a guarantee of your independence and your territorial integrity. And there were other powerful signatories to this, I believe United States, Britain, France. This was a promise to Ukraine to defend Ukraine, by Russia as well.</p><p>Do you think it's ever going to happen? Yes, there are sanctions, but your territory is still occupied, as you just said, temporarily occupied. How temporarily do you think it's going to be occupied for?</p><p>ZELENSKY (through translator): First, how temporarily occupied, well, I have my internal feeling. It's not only the feeling but it is based on the steps that we are making that virtually we will be able to secure the cease fire and ensure the return of our territories. I don't know how much time we will need from that.</p><p>Why Budapest Memorandum, why all these treaties, arrangements, no one could think there could be the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation because we used to live in the Soviet Union, we came to understand each other perfectly well, we celebrated our common holidays, we had common families. You do not expect from somebody who you have been so many years next to, you don't expect such steps.</p><p>And considering the Budapest Memorandum, unfortunately, the civilized world, the civilized people, but unfortunately, we are all aware that the strong army or the nuclear weapons or NATO as a protection of independence and territorial integrity or one or the other country, no other documents, no signatories, no memorandums will defend and are able to defend.</p><p>[13:30:12]</p><p>We are telling you this as Ukrainians, from our experience and example, no protection. I do not believe whatsoever in any papers.</p><p>It's just not simple, you know?</p><p>(through translator): And, honestly, to all countries, this is my proposal, from our personal experience: no confidence, no trust in any kind of documents.</p><p>No one is going to guarantee you anything, though we are talking a lot about international law. The 21st century, the law of the strong. Where are we with you now?</p><p>AMANPOUR: As you know, because of all of this, Ukraine has been labeled one of the most corrupt countries in the world, that that is one of the reputational damages to your country in the wake of -- of all of this.</p><p>And, recently -- I mean, really recently, in November, around Thanksgiving, President Trump told FOX News: \"Why should we give money to a country that's known corrupt? It's a very corrupt country. I mean, I love the people in Ukraine. I know Ukrainian people. They're great people. But it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world.\"</p><p>ZELENSKY: That's not truth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>ZELENSKY: That's not truth.</p><p>When I have -- when I have meeting with Mr. President Trump, and he said about that -- he said that, previous years, it was so corrupt, this country, Ukraine.</p><p>I told him very honestly, and I was very open with him. I told him that we fight with corruption. We fight with this, fight each day. But, please, please, stop to say that Ukraine is a corrupted country, but -- because, from now, it's not truth.</p><p>We want to change this image. And all of our guys, all of our team -- look at our team. Please, you have everything, I know, every -- you have -- you have -- you can check.</p><p>Stolen, yes? (INAUDIBLE) stolen, yes. What was stolen?</p><p>What I did in my life, in my previous life, in my today life, what I did, all money I have, I got it with my talent. That's it. And we have the same team, new, young team, different -- not all of them young, you see.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ZELENSKY: We have another team in Ukraine now.</p><p>And nobody -- from us, we took nothing from government. So we pay all these taxes. What we did? So you have to stop do this image for Ukraine.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, finally...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Finally, Mr. President...</p><p>ZELENSKY: Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: In your first call with the president after your election, after your victory...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ZELENSKY: OK.</p><p>AMANPOUR: ... the president invited you to the White House.</p><p>Do you think it's going to happen? Do you have any date on the calendar?</p><p>ZELENSKY (through translator): I'm sure it will happen.</p><p>Well, you know, it seems to me that the last time that I met the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, we talked about that. And I said I would very much like that my visit to the United States would be something special for both countries, where there's an important and substantive outcome and result for both countries, something beneficial for both countries.</p><p>So, the ball is in the courtyard of the United States of America. But we are always happy to see everyone in Ukraine. So I'm ready to invite President Trump to come to Kiev. And I'm ready to welcome him to Kiev earlier than he is available.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: President Zelensky, thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>ZELENSKY: Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>ZELENSKY: Thank you so much, everybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>ZELENSKY: Thank you so much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: President Zelensky extending that invitation to President Trump to come visit him in his own capital. We will see.</p><p>Now, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, owner of \"The Washington Post\" and richest man on the planet, is now the subject of a documentary.</p><p>The documentary filmmaker James Jacoby has done \"Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos.\" It looks at one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world.</p><p>[13:35:08]</p><p>And Jacoby sat down to talk down with our Hari Sreenivasan to talk whether and how the Bezos machine should be reined in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You go into the archives, so to speak, at how Amazon was founded. And, there, what's interesting is, even when they were just an online bookseller, you point out that they recognized the value of data.</p><p>JAMES JACOBY, DIRECTOR, \"AMAZON EMPIRE: THE RISE AND REIGN OF JEFF BEZOS\": Absolutely.</p><p>So, Jeff Bezos came out of a background in computer science and in engineering. He had worked on Wall Street before founding Amazon at a -- what's called a quantitative hedge fund, basically using data to make trading decisions and figure out trading opportunities, and so really saw the value of data and approaches things like a quant, like a real data- minded person.</p><p>And he brought that mentality to Amazon and has -- really, that kind of imbues the company's ethos. It's all about the data. It's all about understanding consumer behavior online. It's all about the idea that, in the 21st century economy, the company with the most data that crunches that data is ultimately going to win.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: We think a lot about Facebook when we see the word data: Oh, they know my likes and my dislikes.</p><p>What kind of information does Amazon have about its customers?</p><p>JACOBY: Well, it runs the gamut.</p><p>For instance, I mean, they essentially track what you do on the Amazon site. So, that's not just what you buy. It's what you looked at and didn't buy, which is extremely valuable data, because they know what you're interested in, even though you didn't pull the trigger on something.</p><p>They can see what you stopped at on the site. They have had that capacity for a very long time. They do it, they say, in the name of giving you more of what you want. It's different than Facebook, which is trying to sell targeted advertisements to you or political messaging.</p><p>But, when it comes to Amazon, they're getting into the targeted advertising business. They also have Alexa, devices, these Echo devices, where they're gathering data on what you ask your Alexa, what your habits are, what time of day you do certain things or don't do certain things, and starting to get into the realm of detecting things about voice and what -- how your voice sounds.</p><p>So, they have many different means of gathering data on us. It's not entirely clear yet as to how they're going to use all that data, but, certainly, the incentive is to use it in ways that make them more money.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You had a chance to sit down with some of the employees there. There's almost 800,000 people that work for Amazon now. Most of them are employed in what they call the fulfillment centers, what we would look at as the warehouse where all these things are stocked.</p><p>What is the core grievance that the employees that you spoke with had?</p><p>JACOBY: The core grievance is generally about the rate of work. These are really grueling jobs. And it's something -- we spoke to dozens of workers, current and former, around the country.</p><p>And they all talk about the grueling pace of work. It's essentially keeping up with the machine. I mean, for Prime subscribers, there are 150 million of them out there who are looking to get their packages delivered in one day or two days.</p><p>There's a whole system that's partially automated, but a lot of human beings that are picking and packing those items that are getting to your doorstep.</p><p>And the people that are doing that work, it's a sort of relentless pace of work. On the other hand, these jobs pay better than a lot of other equivalent jobs. They're $15-an-hour jobs, which is, as Amazon would point out, double the national minimum wage, and they offer benefits.</p><p>So, there -- it's kind of a mixed bag. I mean, the main grievance is not necessarily about wages or benefits. It's much more about the fact that you can't really stay in these jobs very long. You will kind of burn out quickly, and there isn't necessarily an opportunity at Amazon to move up.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You pointed this out to the company. You said, hey, there's people there that feel like they're being treated like robots.</p><p>What was the company's response?</p><p>JACOBY: The company's response was, well, there's a lot of people that show up for work every day at Amazon and -- to work in these fulfillment centers, and that that must indicate something, that these workers are -- are relatively happy.</p><p>And they also point out that the benefits are -- are good and that the pay is better than the national minimum wage averages, and that they're reinvesting in their work force, to the tune of nearly a billion dollars, to try to upskill these workers.</p><p>So I think that they -- they kind of answered the questions about workers feeling like robots by saying, well, there are some perks of the job as well.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Now, Jeff Bezos did not sit down for this film, but you did have access to several different high-level executives in the company.</p><p>[13:40:02]</p><p>What are your overall thoughts after speaking to them?</p><p>JACOBY: They granted us extraordinary access to a number of members of the so-called S-team. That's sort of Jeff Bezos' inner circle of people that have been at the company for a long time and are really running the core aspects of his businesses.</p><p>And they're -- they're extraordinarily competent. They have -- this company is -- deserves a tremendous amount of respect for what it's able to deliver. And a lot of us do, even unknowingly, rely on it in certain ways.</p><p>PBS, its digital infrastructure is on Amazon Web Services, for instance. And that's -- that's rather fascinating.</p><p>And I found them to be open to the scrutiny that we came with of asking challenging questions. And I think we give them the time and the fairness to answer all those questions in full.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: One of the most interesting exchanges for me was one that you had with Andy Jassy. And you were asking him about a facial recognition technology that's being used by police departments.</p><p>First of all, most people don't even understand or realize that, A, the technology exists, B, that Amazon is behind it, and, C, that they're actually selling it to police departments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACOBY: There's been all sorts of problems with policing in this country. Why allow police departments to experiment?</p><p>ANDY JASSY, CEO, AMAZON WEB SERVICES: We believe that governments and the organizations that are charged with keeping our communities safe have to have access to the most sophisticated modern technology that exists.</p><p>We don't have a large number of police departments that are using our facial Rekognition technology. And, as I said, we have never received any complaints of misuse. Let's see if somehow they abuse the technology. They haven't done that.</p><p>And to assume that they're going to do it, and, therefore, you shouldn't allow them to have access to the most sophisticated technology out there, doesn't feel like the right balance to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Explain what Rekognition is.</p><p>JACOBY: So, Rekognition -- with a K -- Rekognition is the Amazon facial recognition tool.</p><p>And, essentially, what it is, is that you can upload a bunch of photographs to Amazon and -- as a kind of data set. And police departments, for instance, use it with mug shots. And then they try to match suspects in order to -- against that database.</p><p>And Amazon's service, its tool, helps them do that and bring the services in order to bring the time down for detectives or police officers to try to identify a suspect quickly.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: So, it's a virtual book of mug shots that have thousands and thousands of photos.</p><p>JACOBY: That's correct.</p><p>And so a number of police departments are using it in that way. And, essentially, the service is Amazon's. And it's rather inexpensive for a police department to do this.</p><p>And the cops we spoke to actually really love this service. There are a lot of civil libertarians that don't love the service and, surprisingly, a number of computer scientists that we spoke, including the former head of artificial intelligence at Amazon Web Services, who basically comes out to say that she doesn't believe that this technology is accurate enough to be put into the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>And that's something that we do challenge Andy Jassy about.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Because researchers have figured out that the software is not so accurate when it comes to faces of people of color.</p><p>JACOBY: That's correct.</p><p>So, MIT did a study called the Gender Shades study. Some -- some scientists there came up with findings. They tested Amazon's facial recognition software. They also tested other facial recognition software that's on the market.</p><p>And they did find that, when it comes to darker skin faces, and especially women, the software was inaccurate and prone to mistakes. And this is why people like Anima Anandkumar, former chief scientist of A.I. at AWS, have come out and said that Bezos and Amazon should stop giving this tool to law enforcement until there can be public oversight or there can be further study of its accuracy.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Yes.</p><p>JACOBY: But the company continues to do so.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: There's another product that's become quite successful for Amazon. It's these doorbells that people have where you just -- when you press the doorbell automatically, there's a camera that's looking at you. And if you're at home, you can -- you can know who's outside, right?</p><p>Now, there's a connection between these doorbells and police departments. Explain.</p><p>JACOBY: Sure.</p><p>So, Amazon purchased a company called Ring, which makes these doorbell cameras that -- essentially, it's a camera on your doorstep. It also faces out toward the street, public areas, which is problematic for some.</p><p>And they set up an app, essentially, called the Neighbors or the Neighborhood app, where there's -- your footage can be accessed by your community. It's sort of the new neighborhood watch, where people can watch what's going on.</p><p>And, essentially, in order to market Ring, Amazon entered into these partnerships with police departments, where some police departments would even hand out free doorbells.</p><p>[13:45:10]</p><p>Sometimes, they'd adhere to a script that Amazon and Ring gave out, basically talking points about why this is a good thing for neighborhood safety, convincing citizens to put these doorbell cameras on their doorposts, because -- but this was unbeknownst to the citizens that these cops were essentially salespeople in this instance for Amazon and Ring.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: So, the incentive for the police departments is that they have access to the footage when they would like it.</p><p>Let's say, if a criminal was running past the street, they're going to, what, ask you and say, hey, can we take a look at your footage?</p><p>JACOBY: That's right.</p><p>And they -- so, essentially, what it -- what the app does is, it makes it really easy for the police to access this portal that Amazon Ring set up. And, essentially, they can go, and they can easily ask someone on that portal, hey, can I get your footage from the other night? There was a report of a crime in your neighbor's house or in your neighborhood. We'd love to see what you -- what your doorbell camera caught that night.</p><p>And they don't necessarily need -- they don't need a warrant to ask for that.</p><p>But it raises a number of questions about making it easy for police departments to do that. Essentially, they can just kind of click a button, and the e-mail goes out to whoever's camera it is. And, certainly, the ACLU and other civil liberties groups are very worried about this, because, essentially, we're not seeing -- the public doesn't have access to how those interactions are taking place.</p><p>So, there are a number of people that are rather concerned about that very tight relationship between law enforcement and this kind of new unregulated surveillance network.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have had an incredible year. The team has invented a lot on behalf of customers. And I cannot wait to show you what we have so far</p><p>NARRATOR: So far, Limp his team has made Alexa compatible with more than 100,000 products.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN: The most successful gadget that Amazon's been selling -- and it's been a big, successful stocking stuffer for years now -- is the Amazon Echo and the Echo devices.</p><p>When -- these are devices that are in people's homes, what are the privacy concerns that are surrounding it? What are the problems that have happened? And the people that you have talked to who -- what are their reactions? How do they live their own lives with these devices in their house?</p><p>JACOBY: The Echo devices have been extraordinarily successful for Amazon. And they have sold maybe 100 million of these devices around the world. And people speak to Alexa, this artificial intelligence, through these devices.</p><p>The privacy concern really comes with the fact that it hadn't been clearly disclosed to consumers that, when Alexa is awake, when the device is awake and listening to you, and there's a blue light that shows you that, and you have said, Alexa, hey, asked her a question or something, once she's awake, she's recording.</p><p>And, in some cases, those recordings are then listened to by teams of thousands of people around the world who are trying to train Alexa, the artificial intelligence, to get better at responding to commands or responding to questions.</p><p>But it wasn't clear to consumers that there would be the even the potential of a human being listening to those recordings. And it wasn't necessarily clearly disclosed to consumers that there was a -- there was -- there was a recording made.</p><p>So, that -- even a top executive who's head of devices admitted that, if he could go back in time and disclose that to consumers, he would do so. But he said that he thought, even if he had, it wouldn't have affected how popular Alexa and these devices are.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Considering how big Amazon is getting, especially in providing services to the U.S. government, is the government capable of regulating Amazon?</p><p>JACOBY: Yes, I mean, certainly.</p><p>I think that there -- there are concerns about Amazon's increasing presence in Washington, D.C. They're going to have a second headquarters there. Jeff Bezos owns \"The Washington Post.\" He's got a very large presence Now in Washington, has a big mansion there, I think the largest private residence.</p><p>And people are worried about the influence this kind of economic, as well as now political, influence in D.C., and whether that is a move to try to figure out ways to either get regulators on their side or any enforcers on their side.</p><p>But I think there's quite a bit of momentum in Congress to figure out a way to regulate, not just Amazon, but all the big tech companies, and figure out, one, how existing law is applicable to them and can be enforced more stringently, and, two, whether new laws should be written about data collection or what -- for instance, what lines of business a company like Amazon can engage in.</p><p>[13:50:03]</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You also point out in the film that there's been a shift philosophically with how we think about antitrust, that it used to be that we would talk about making sure that there was an even competitive landscape for companies to be able to compete, and that we would break up companies in the past that we thought were getting close to monopoly status.</p><p>But, in the last 30 years, that's changed, and we now seem to value lower prices.</p><p>JACOBY: Yes.</p><p>I mean, for the past 30 years, there's been something called the consumer welfare standard. And our enforcers, which is really the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, who are meant to patrol the economy for people that are abusing market dominance in ways that not just hurt consumers, but also may hurt competitors or small businesses that rely on their -- these large dominant players.</p><p>For the past 30 years, the enforcers have really looked at it in a very narrow lens of, if you're not -- if you're using your market dominance to hurt consumers by raising prices, that's no go, that's no good, but if you're using that power to kind of hurt other businesses, with the added benefit of it being low prices for consumers, then that kind of got a pass for the -- for -- over the years.</p><p>And the FTC right now is engaged in a meaningful reexamination of its stance that it's taken for the past few decades. And it should be interesting to see what they do.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: One of the things that's intriguing is that, while companies -- technology companies like Facebook and Google have been scrutinized and have perhaps lost some trust from their consumers, the level of trust that people have in Amazon is still pretty high, and it's bipartisan.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>JACOBY: It's actually not just pretty high. It's really high.</p><p>I mean, Georgetown University did a study, and basically found that Amazon is the most trusted institution in America after the U.S. military. And I think a lot of the trust that they have engendered over the years is because they're just incredibly competent at what they do, and they deliver on their promises. They literally deliver on them.</p><p>And that's how they have engendered this trust. And I think, going forward, as the -- as the company ventures into things like facial recognition software, and these really high-tech things, and cloud services for the military, and these Ring cameras, and they're kind of going full sci-fi on us, in a way that we may or may not be able to opt out of, I think that they're testing that trust to some degree.</p><p>And I think it's going to be an important question that they will have to answer for going forward as to how good they are at safeguarding all of the data that they have got access to, and that they're not using it to exploit their consumers, but, rather, as they claim, help them.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: James Jacoby, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JACOBY: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the documentary \"Amazon Empire\" airs on Tuesday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time on PBS and online at PBS.org/Frontline.</p><p>And, finally, donations have poured in from all over the world for the Australian bushfire relief effort.

Good luck</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ONE of the quirks of LinkedIn, a career-oriented networking site with over 562m users, is that strangers wish you a happy birthday even when your mum has forgotten. If this happens to you, don't respond: it could be a Chinese spy. According to Reuters, American counter-intelligence chiefs think that China is running a \"super-aggressive\" campaign on LinkedIn to recruit experts in health care, green energy and technology. Other agencies are nervous, too. The FBI complains of an \"unparalleled\" level of economic espionage. The National Security Agency says America is being \"pummelled\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The spooks' warnings are part of a wave of anger in the West about ideas leaking across borders. On June 1st the European Union complained to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that China prevents European firms from getting a fair price for their intellectual property (IP). A 215-page White House report on China's trading practices published in March was filled with accusations of IP violations, including outright theft and the forced transfer of IP to joint-venture partners in China. On August 1st Congress approved a law that gives the government sweeping powers to police cross-border deals involving \"critical technologies\".</p><p>For American firms the stakes are high. They derive 80% of their market value from intangible assets such as patents and brands, as opposed to physical ones. They own half of the world's IP. At the biggest 50 multinationals, 65% of foreign profits come from IP-intensive businesses such as tech and drugs. The latest star firms rely on selling intangibles across borders. Netflix has 73m users outside of Uncle Sam. NVIDIA, which designs artificial-intelligence (AI) chips, makes 87% of its sales abroad.</p><p>Yet in the eyes of many American bosses and security types the global IP regime is broken. The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 is intended to police IP theft by governments and firms but has led to few prosecutions; WTO rules on safeguarding IP abroad have little bite. What is required now, many believe, is tough, unilateral action by America to enforce its rights abroad. Companies want stronger control of IP, allowing them to maximise their profits. The IP Commission, a lobbying group in Washington, reckons that they are being robbed of up to $600bn a year.</p><p>Politicians and the security establishment have a grander aim: regulating the flow of ideas to preserve American technological supremacy. History is not encouraging. At any point in time an elite group of firms in a particular country are on the frontier of innovation. Businesses and governments in poorer places try to catch up, because that is the best way to get rich. According to the IMF, the absorption of foreign IP explains 40% of the growth in labour productivity in emerging economies between 2004 and 2014. The incentives for such countries are so powerful that hoarding ideas away from them is like clutching a wet bar of soap.</p><p>Thus in the Anglo-French wars of the 1700s France recruited British defectors to unlock the secrets of coal technologies. In the subsequent century America stole British designs for looms and trains. Japan mimicked the West during the Meiji Restoration. South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore industrialised by buying and stealing Western ideas on everything from ships to chips. Cries of foul play from the global hegemon are to be expected. In the case of Britain, it passed an act against economic espionage in 1719. In the 1980s Caspar Weinberger, America's defence secretary, fretted about the haemorrhaging of high-tech ideas to the Soviet Union, which had a wishlist for its spies called the Red Book.</p><p>Despite this, the Soviets did less for computers than Steve Wozniak in the Jobs family's garage. To take off, after all, foreign ideas need to be absorbed and commercialised by firms and entrepreneurs. One channel is contractual relationships, such as foreign direct investment or licensing. Another is persistent theft. But often there is a grey area that includes reverse-engineering products, tips from suppliers and headhunting experts from rivals. Globalisation and the web have deepened all these channels. Companies' IP is more scattered owing to global production chains. A global jobs market exists for technical experts and armies of students learn abroad. </p><p>How might America control the flow of ideas? During the cold war it ran a Western embargo of the Soviet Union for military goods and some high-tech ones, through a secretive body known as COCOM. Today it would need an even more intrusive and coercive approach to assert its IP rights unilaterally. Establishing an extraterritorial deterrent would require crippling punishments for firms that violated IP, such as banning them from using the dollar-based banking system. A Big Brother regime would be needed at home. There are 67,000 AI experts working in America who are ethnic Chinese, according to an analysis of LinkedIn by Bernstein, a research firm. They can hardly all be suspects.</p><p>Even then, China and other countries might balk at paying a bigger tribute to America's IP supremacy. If USA Inc charged the world $600bn more, and this hit was absorbed by all foreign companies, it would cut total profits outside America by about a tenth. The return on equity of American multinationals abroad (excluding financial firms) would soar from 8% to 14%. Europe and emerging countries are already uneasy about the large and lightly taxed rents that American firms extract abroad, from the drugs industry to the big tech companies.</p><p>America's economy is shifting further towards intangibles. The administration and bosses are right that China has misbehaved. But ideas are harder to police than gearboxes and coils of steel. The solution is a global regime that permits the flow of ideas, prohibits theft, offers a framework for pricing IP and sees that rules are enforced. A next-generation global trade treaty, in other words. Sadly, this is exactly the multilateral approach to trade that America has rejected. Not one of its best ideas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-SK7G9KG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T82-89G1-DY2R-202S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Thank you. Thanks, Greg.</p><p>This is a Fox News alert. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>We are following three breaking stories tonight.</p><p>President Trump has decided to put business first and not punish Saudi Arabia over the murder of a journalist.</p><p>The President has also submitted written answers to special counsel Robert Mueller's questions concerning his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>And the market meltdown continues with another day of major losses on Wall Street.</p><p>First though, President Trump says no further repercussions are coming for the Saudis for the killing of that reporter Jamal Khashoggi at the Kingdom's embassy in Turkey, the consulate there. He says the reason is America first. The decision comes despite a report the CIA has determined the Saudi Crown Prince ordered the killing.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts leads us off tonight from the north lawn. Good evening -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.</p><p>President Trump is catching flak from members of his own party about his decision to not punish Saudi Arabia's leadership over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a close friend of the President, saying he believes the President's decision is Saudi Arabia first, not America first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: Departing the White House for Mar-a-Lago, President Trump today weighed in on the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, siding with Saudi Arabia, refusing to say whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the Khashoggi killing.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Maybe he did, maybe didn't. We are with Saudi Arabia. We're staying with Saudi Arabia --</p><p>ROBERTS: In a statement this afternoon, President Trump said \"King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder.\"</p><p>What is known, the President said, is that Saudi Arabia plays a crucial role in America's national and economic security citing the threat from Iran and some $450 billion in arms and commercial sales to Saudi Arabia inked last year.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's a mean nasty world out there. The Middle East in particular. There are important American interests to keep the American people safe.</p><p>ROBERTS: In his statement the President denounced the crime against Khashoggi as a terrible one and pointed out the U.S. has already taken strong action against 17 Saudis known to have participated in the murder.</p><p>But pointing a finger of blame at the Crown Prince was a risk President Trump did not want to take.</p><p>TRUMP: It's all about America first. We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars in orders and let Russia, China, and everybody else have them.</p><p>ROBERTS: The President also addressed the disclosure that his daughter Ivanka had used a private e-mail address to do White House business when she first joined the administration.</p><p>TRUMP: This is just early on when she came in. These calls were not classified unlike Hillary Clinton's calls which were classified.</p><p>ROBERTS: In 2016, President Trump made Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server a central part of his campaign. But in a statement today, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump's attorney Abbe Lowell said, \"She did not create a private server in her house or office. There was never classified information transmitted. The account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization. No e-mails were ever deleted, and the e-mails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"</p><p>President Trump called it nonstory.</p><p>TRUMP: Ivanka can handle herself. These are all in the historical records and it's all fake news.</p><p>ROBERTS: The beginning of the President's Thanksgiving break was marred by a steep decline in the stock market, President Trump waving off the pullback today insisting the fundamentals of the economy are strong.</p><p>TRUMP: Our unemployment is at a record low, you look at all of the different statistics. I think your tech stocks have some problems but that will come back.</p><p>ROBERTS: The decline began after Vice President Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping got into a war of words at the APEC conference in Papua New Guinea over the weekend. Chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow insisting that standing up to China is the right thing to do.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: It will come to a head at the G-20. Vice President Pence, as he always does, defended American interests.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: On the Khashoggi killing, President Trump is also hearing from another friend, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who, with a statement said, \"To look the other way in this case is the wrong thing to do.\" Graham adding quote, \"I firmly believe there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms\" -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: John -- the \"New York Times\" is reporting President Trump wanted to prosecute two of his political critics -- former FBI director James Comey and Hillary Clinton. What are you hearing there?</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, certainly in public President Trump mentioned on many different occasions that he thought that the FBI and the DOJ should at least be investigating James Comey the former FBI director and his opponent in 2016, Hillary Clinton. But this story takes it a step further to suggest that President Trump actually he mentioned to his then-White House counsel Don McGahn that he wanted the Department of Justice to go after Comey and Clinton.</p><p>According to the \"New York Times\", McGahn took it seriously enough that he had his attorneys in the White House Counsel's office draft a memo for the President outlining for him all of the horrible things that would happen to his presidency if he were to order such an investigation -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow it. John Roberts, live on the north lawn. John -- thanks.</p><p>President Trump has answered the questions special counsel Robert Mueller submitted in his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is here to tell us where things stand tonight. Good evening -- Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Thank you - - Bret, and good evening.</p><p>Within the last hour the President's legal team issued a brief statement confirming the President's written responses are now with special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>Significantly, the questions dealt with Russia-related topics on the firing of FBI director James Comey as part of any obstruction investigation. \"It has been our position from the outset that much of what has been asked raise serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry,\" Rudy Giuliani said. \"This remains our position today. The President has nonetheless provided unprecedented cooperation.\"</p><p>The President's team also emphasized they provided more than 30 witnesses, 1.4 million pages of material and now the President's written responses -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine -- Democrats unleashed another assault on his choice to lead the Justice Department. Tell us about that.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Well today Democrats launched a third front in their assault on the legitimacy of acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released a letter calling on the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate potentially unlawful or improper contact prior to the appointment between acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, President Trump, as well as White House chief of staff John Kelly.</p><p>Citing media reports, Schumer writes, \"Mr. Whitaker was seen by department officials as a partisan and a White House spy. He was also known as the West Wing's eyes and ears.\"</p><p>In addition to the lawsuit filed by three Senate Democrats this week, House Democrat Jerry Nadler who is positioned to take over the Judiciary Committee has threatened to immediately force Whitaker to testify on Capitol Hill in January.</p><p>Earlier today on the White House lawn, the President stood by his choice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: He's doing a very good job. Everybody tells me that Matt Whitaker is doing a fantastic job. So, you know, we'll have to see where everything goes but everybody -- everybody tells me he's doing a fantastic job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: Major has -- Whitaker, pardon me, has a major speaking event in New York City tomorrow on national security issues -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine Herridge -- thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: More problems for big tech and major retailers led to another wild ride on Wall Street today. The Dow lost 552 today. The S&amp;P 500 fell 49. The Nasdaq dropped 120.</p><p>So what is happening? Let's get some perspective. Susan Li of the Fox Business Network joins us again from New York. Good evening -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi -- Bret.</p><p>2018 is looking to be a down year for investors. Both the S&amp;P and the Dow have now wiped out their gains on the year while the Nasdaq is barely in the green. Today we saw a dramatic drop for oil prices with the biggest single day loss in three years weighed by trade concerns and by President Trump's statements on Saudi Arabia which is one of the world's largest oil producers.</p><p>Energy stocks plunging. Every single oil stock on the S&amp;P 500 falling today but that also means it's cheaper at the pump for consumers. The national average, $2.61 -- almost a quarter cheaper than it was a month ago which means more money in consumers' wallets as we head into Black Friday, which is supposed to be one of the biggest shopping days of the year and Americans are expected to spend more this year than they did last year. But that didn't help out the retailers today despite better results from Kohl's and Target.</p><p>Also weighing on the markets, big technology names -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet, parent to Google all in bear markets, 20 percent down from recent peaks. The concern for investors continue to be higher interest rates, global economic slowdown and lower expectations for future company sales and profits.</p><p>Traditionally the week of Thanksgiving is usually a positive week for stock markets with the S&amp;P 500 rising for the past six straight years while the Dow has gained 19 out of the past 24 years. This year however it's looking difficult for investors to see positive returns on the week.</p><p>Bret -- back to you.</p><p>BAIER: Susan Li in New York. Susan -- thank you.</p><p>This is another Fox News alert.</p><p>Ohio Democratic Congresswoman Marcia Fudge says she will not challenge Nancy Pelosi for the speaker of the house job next year.

The panel, an expanded panel coming up on the day's top stories.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Your team is preparing written answers to questions --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, no, not my team. I'm preparing written answers. I'm the one that does the answering. Yes, are they writing them out? Yes. They are writing what I tell them to write.</p><p>WALLACE: Are they going to be submitted?</p><p>TRUMP: At some point very soon, yes.</p><p>WALLACE: Not today.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know what the timing is, but I finished them.</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>TRUMP: I completed them.</p><p>WALLACE: So you are submitting --</p><p>TRUMP: It wasn't a big deal. By the way, it wasn't a big deal. The questions were asked and answered. It wasn't a big deal. They make it like I had meetings for many, many hours. I got the questions, I responded. We wrote them out, I read them once, I read them a second time. We made some changes. That's it. They've very simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Now the homework assignment is done, President Trump turning in his questions to the special counsel Robert Mueller, ending this portion of the Q and A that was submitted to the president. The president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, issuing a statement, \"It's been our position from the outset that much of what has been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry. This remains our position today. The president has nonetheless provided unprecedented cooperation. Special counsel has been provided with more than 30 witnesses, 1.4 million pages of material, and now the president's written responses to questions. It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion.\"</p><p>With that, let's start there with our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, John McCormack, senior writer at \"The Weekly Standard,\" and Bill Bennett, former education secretary and author of the book \"The True St. Nicholas.\"</p><p>Bill, let's start with you, your thoughts on this. The homework is turned in.</p><p>BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: \"The True St. Nicholas,\" If you want to take a break from politics, it's a good read about somebody very much associated with Christmas who people don't know.</p><p>I hope it's almost over. I hope with Rudy Giuliani it's almost over. My guess is it is. And I think it's basically good news for Donald Trump. He got these inquiries, it was a take-home assignment, as it has been called. He answered questions and sent them back. My guess is there's not a rebuttal or another response, so that's that. But we'll wait and see. We've all been wondering if there's anything there there. And we'll soon find out.</p><p>BAIER: Byron, it seems like the clock is ticking.</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": The thing we don't know is whether this is tying things up with a bow or opening up new areas of inquiry. Mueller could have follow-up questions, some of the president's answers could raise issues that were not previously considered or that Mueller wants to go into.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani said in his statement that the White House had raised the issue of executive privilege or a lot of questions involving obstruction, all of which, if it took place, took place in the White House. So these questions apparently focused on what took place during the campaign. Was there any collusion? We know the president said a million times in public that there was no collusion. My guess is the answers are very similar to that. So the question is, is Mueller going to be satisfied by these questions, and close up, or does it open up something new?</p><p>BAIER: And A.B., I guess the other question is what does the Democratic House do if the Mueller report is not finished before the end of this year as they take control of the House of Representatives?</p><p>A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: That is the most interesting question, Bret, because they want to tread carefully. There is a division in their party about how strenuously they should investigate the administration, and overlap with the Russia collusion probe, obstruction of justice investigation that Mueller has been tackling outside the special counsel, and of course this whole question of whether or not they would ever try to even begin a discussion of a potential impeachment without the findings of a special counsel report.</p><p>I think, and I don't have Mueller's sources because nobody does, that it's obvious that the special counsel is trying to squeeze Roger Stone because of the way he's going after the associates around Roger Stone. I don't think that a Mueller report is coming soon. And like Byron, I think it's possible with the fact that the president has only responded to questions about the campaign and nothing about obstruction of justice or impeding the investigation or abuse of power like \"The New York Times\" reporting on today, that it doesn't mean that it's tied up with a bow.</p><p>So it's going to be a challenge to the Democrats to not overreach, to trust in the special counsel, and to strike a balance here in what they choose to probe.</p><p>BAIER: The other big story today, John, was the Jamal Khashoggi investigation, the statement put out by the White House. The president reacting to essentially saying we've done what we are going to do with Saudi Arabia and we're going to move on. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We put out a statement on Saudi Arabia, which I guess most of you have seen. The CIA has looked at it, they've studied it a lot. They have nothing definitive. And the fact is maybe he did, maybe he didn't, it's all about America first. We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars in orders and let Russia, China, and everybody else have them.</p><p>I'm not going to destroy the world economy, and I'm not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia. If we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: John, thoughts?</p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, \"WEEKLY STANDARD\": I think on the specific question of whether we should cut off all arms sales to Saudi Arabia, obviously I think that that is a foolish thing to do and the president is right on that specific policy.</p><p>What I don't think that he got right is this idea that you have to lie for foreign dictators, you have to help them cover up a murder, that you should cast doubt on our own intelligence, American intelligence, which reportedly has said with a high degree of confidence that Saudi Arabia, the leadership, Mohammed bin Salman did order this. So I do think that obviously there are tough calls and strategic alliances with unsavory and even sometimes evil dictators, but you can also speak for American values, you can speak for human dignity, human rights. President Reagan did that very well. President Trump is either incapable or unwilling to do that.</p><p>I thought this was a bit reminiscent of the North Korean statements, where he said Kim Jong-un loves his people with great fervor and they love him back. This idea that you have to actively praise these brutal dictators is something that Trump believes is necessary to foreign policy.</p><p>BAIER: Bill, this is getting a lot of criticism. Senator Lindsey Graham, who is obviously an ally of the president, said \"I firmly believe there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the Royal Family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms. While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the crown prince in multiple ways has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic.\"</p><p>BENNETT: Part of the reason for the reaction is we know so much of the particulars. The particulars have been presented over and over again. It's gruesome and deserves condemnation. This is a gruesome execution, torture and execution. But as a critic of Donald Trump, James Clapper, said, we must maintain relations with Saudi Arabia. It's very important. And by the way, we have had worse enemies than Saudi Arabia. We have one now called a Iran. Churchill and Roosevelt also had allies that were much worse that Saudi Arabia.</p><p>BAIER: Byron, you think there will be pushback on Capitol Hill?</p><p>YORK: Oh, yes. Trump can be amazingly frank about his reasons for doing things, and he has clearly made a calculation that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is more valuable than inflicting any further punishment over the murder of Khashoggi.</p><p>By the way, the United States has sanctioned 17 Saudis in relation to this, one of whom was fairly close to the crown prince. But Trump comes out and he says Saudi Arabia is a vital ally in the war on terror. They spent $400 billion with us, $110 billion in military spending. That's huge, that's in our interest, I'm not going to get any further worked up about this murder. And it's an astonishingly frank, realist kind of statement, and I think even his supporters wish he could probably find more of a middle ground. I think John was suggesting that, more of a middle ground to take more into account, the humans right issues involved, at the same time still reaffirming the relationship between the U.S. and the Saudis.</p><p>BAIER: Right. I think, A.B., that his supporters say this is somebody speaking out without the filter, and that other presidents might not have said it publicly but this is what they were probably thinking. The foreign minister from Iran tweeted out, Zarif, \"Mr. Trump bizarrely devotes his first paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse Iran of every sort of malfeasance he can think of it. Perhaps we're also responsible for the California fires because we didn't help rake the forests -- just like the Fins do.\" So getting in a jab there from Iran's perspective.</p><p>STODDARD: The message that this sends around the world to our allies and our adversaries is one of weakness and abandonment of our values. The president fails to affirm our commitment to the values that make us great. His statement said -- it was a statement of standing with Saudi Arabia. There was no balance, there was none of the values and commitments that you discuss your commitment to and then you pivot to the importance of a relationship. If was basically if they are going to give us money, we need them. And I'm competing for contracts with the Russians and the Chinese.</p><p>And I think there is no better statement from his ally, Rand Paul, who said this is not America first, this is Saudi Arabia first. The condemnation has been swift and profound, and it's because the president is not acting in the best interests of this country when he solely makes this a business arrangement.</p><p>BAIER: Let's end with this. There's a cultural shift happening, we covered tonight. The Massachusetts legal marijuana, Bill, you had some thoughts about that before we leave.</p><p>BENNETT: I think in Massachusetts, a lot of celebration, first sale of recreational marijuana. I will predict that they will come to regret this, as they are coming to regret this in Colorado. They will make a lot of money, but if you want to invest, you should probably invest in treatment centers, because you will see a huge explosion in that.</p><p>Everyone is worrying about this terrible opioid crisis. I'm reminded of C.S. Lewis who said when in a flood, don't grab for the hoses. We are making this problem worse. There are more people in drug treatment for marijuana than all other drugs combined. And if you want to know how people get into other serious drugs, it's through marijuana. Not primarily through the mis-prescription, the overprescribing of drugs at CVS, but it's from marijuana. So be careful.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, we covered the waterfront tonight, thank you very much.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to regulate artificial intelligence, calling it \u201ca fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.\u201d And Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg thinks mass tech-fueled unemployment might make a universal basic income necessary.  </p><p><br/>What\u2019s this all about? Isn\u2019t Silicon Valley supposed to be a font of perpetual, over-the-top optimism? I thought we could solve just about any problem with enough applied data or a really clever algorithm. If those fabulously wealthy folks are gloomy about tomorrow, what hope do the rest of us mere mortals have?  <br/>After all, it\u2019s been a terrible decade for the U.S. economy. A horrific financial crisis was followed by a historically weak recovery. Every silver lining seems surrounded by a big dark cloud. America is creating lots of jobs, for instance, but wage growth remains so-so. And we\u2019re probably still not back to full employment.  <br/>But one part of the American Growth Machine that does seem to be fully in gear is the technology sector. The world\u2019s four most valuable public companies are American tech giants: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. The U.S is also home to some 100 startups worth at least $1 billion each \u2014 more than twice as many as Asia and six times as many as Europe. What\u2019s more, tech innovation may be stronger than economic data suggests. Recent research finds tech equipment prices are probably falling faster than official measures show. That implies innovation in the digital economy is even faster than we think.  <br/>And things could get even better. All that innovation has yet to really show up in the productivity numbers that feed into GDP and income growth. But sometimes growth lags behind innovation as businesses work out how to best use new technologies. For instance: It took factories decades to efficiently reorganize themselves around the installation of electric motors. In the 1980s, economists wondered why the computer revolution was having so little observable economic impact. But then came the 1990s internet boom. And some experts think a host of new tech and applications \u2014 AI, robotics, e-learnings, big-data analytics \u2014 may be ready to transform the physical economy, generating faster growth and higher incomes.  <br/>Unless, of course, we screw things up with an anti-tech backlash. As I wrote for the The Week last year, it\u2019s not a huge leap from populist politicians blaming trade for all our troubles to blaming robots. There will always be opportunists who play on people\u2019s fears. And those concerns might only increase as tech further disrupts the economy and workers\u2019 lives. We might be entering an extended time of \u201ctechnopanic,\u201d according to analyst Adam Thierer. Imagine a bell-shaped curve illustrating a \u201ccycle of panic.\u201d Starting at \u201ctrusted beginnings,\u201d Thierer explains, the curve ascends left-to-right to \u201crising panic\u201d and peaks at \u201cthe height of hysteria\u201d before descending to \u201cdeflating fears\u201d and finally \u201cmoving on.\u201d  <br/>Unfortunately, we are still probably on the fearful left side of the technopanic curve with the worst yet to come. An analysis by Baylor University researcher Paul McClure found 37 percent of Americans fit the definition of a \u201ctechnophobe,\u201d and are more worried about losing their job to a robot than a romantic breakup or public speaking.  <br/>But here\u2019s the thing: We need more innovation spread throughout more of the economy to boost living standards over the long term. So maybe the tech community should focus harder on thinking of ways \u2014 innovative education and retraining applications seem critical \u2014 to make sure the economy, as Dartmouth University political scientist Russell Muirhead writes in a recent essay, \u201cproduces wealth and work.\u201d Americans need to hear a plausible story about how that happens, and Silicon Valley has a role to play in helping tell it. It\u2019s certainly in the self interest of Big Tech to do so given how activists are using fears of tech-driven joblessness to argue for expansive regulation or antitrust actions against them. At least in the near term, that\u2019s a far more likely scenario than AI enslaving humanity. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN144836220170720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2M-62S1-DXCW-D4DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 20, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CMJ5</classCode><className>BUSINESS ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to regulate artificial intelligence, calling it \u201ca fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.\u201d And Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg thinks mass tech-fueled unemployment might make a universal basic income necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What\u2019s this all about? Isn\u2019t Silicon Valley supposed to be a font of perpetual, over-the-top optimism? I thought we could solve just about any problem with enough applied data or a really clever algorithm. If those fabulously wealthy folks are gloomy about tomorrow, what hope do the rest of us mere mortals have?</p><p>After all, it\u2019s been a terrible decade for the U.S economy. A horrific financial crisis was followed by a historically weak recovery. Every silver lining seems surrounded by a big dark cloud. America is creating lots of jobs, for instance, but wage growth remains so-so. And we\u2019re probably still not back to full employment.</p><p>But one part of the American Growth Machine that does seem to be fully in gear is the technology sector. The world\u2019s four most valuable public companies are American tech giants: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. The U.S is also home to some 100 startups worth at least $1 billion each \u2014 more than twice as many as Asia and six times as many as Europe. What\u2019s more, tech innovation may be stronger than economic data suggests. Recent research finds tech equipment prices are probably falling faster than official measures show. That implies innovation in the digital economy is even faster than we think.</p><p>And things could get even better. All that innovation has yet to really show up in the productivity numbers that feed into GDP and income growth. But sometimes growth lags behind innovation as businesses work out how to best use new technologies. For instance: It took factories decades to efficiently reorganize themselves around the installation of electric motors. In the 1980s, economists wondered why the computer revolution was having so little observable economic impact. But then came the 1990s internet boom. And some experts think a host of new tech and applications \u2014 AI, robotics, e-learnings, big-data analytics \u2014 may be ready to transform the physical economy, generating faster growth and higher incomes.</p><p>Unless, of course, we screw things up with an anti-tech backlash. As I wrote for the The Week last year, it\u2019s not a huge leap from populist politicians blaming trade for all our troubles to blaming robots. There will always be opportunists who play on people\u2019s fears. And those concerns might only increase as tech further disrupts the economy and workers\u2019 lives. We might be entering an extended time of \u201ctechnopanic,\u201d according to analyst Adam Thierer. Imagine a bell-shaped curve illustrating a \u201ccycle of panic.\u201d Starting at \u201ctrusted beginnings,\u201d Thierer explains, the curve ascends left-to-right to \u201crising panic\u201d and peaks at \u201cthe height of hysteria\u201d before descending to \u201cdeflating fears\u201d and finally \u201cmoving on.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, we are still probably on the fearful left side of the technopanic curve with the worst yet to come. An analysis by Baylor University researcher Paul McClure found 37 percent of Americans fit the definition of a \u201ctechnophobe,\u201d and are more worried about losing their job to a robot than a romantic breakup or public speaking.</p><p>But here\u2019s the thing: We need more innovation spread throughout more of the economy to boost living standards over the long term. So maybe the tech community should focus harder on thinking of ways \u2014 innovative education and retraining applications seem critical \u2014 to make sure the economy, as Dartmouth University political scientist Russell Muirhead writes in a recent essay, \u201cproduces wealth and work.\u201d Americans need to hear a plausible story about how that happens, and Silicon Valley has a role to play in helping tell it. It\u2019s certainly in the self interest of Big Tech to do so given how activists are using fears of tech-driven joblessness to argue for expansive regulation or antitrust actions against them. At least in the near term, that\u2019s a far more likely scenario than AI enslaving humanity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS248756I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2N-2HK1-JDG9-Y4GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 20, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

One would hope, specifically as a Conservative, to see the GOP put forth a vision for America to counteract the vague blank checkbook of policies put forth by the Democrats during their week-long diversity seminar.[3] Unfortunately, it seems our hopes have been crushed once more by the people who are supposedly 'on our side' with the publication of the RNC speakers list from the Trump Campaign[4] this morning. Rather than writing an article about why this is a disaster, I decided to go with a more direct approach. Below is the complete list of speakers, by day, along with an 'America First Scale' ranking and a summary of the good and/or bad for each person. </p><p>The scale is from zero to ten, with zero being an honorary John Bolton-esque Neocon[5], and ten being a true America First-er, on par with Trump (at least how he campaigned). The most interesting finding, at least in my opinion, is that many of the 'DC Insider' speakers, all of the big power players, are the Neocons put up by the RNC and the small, theme/topic example speakers are seemingly more tilted toward Populist, America-First actions.Simply click the menu below to perform sorting functions. Page is updated very frequently so please come back or bookmark the page. This database is complied by scouring hundreds of sites, emails and last but not least Valuewalk's top-notch exclusive sources network. We believe we have the MOST extensive source out there of what is Read More[6] My sources for this list include <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ontheissues.org\">www.ontheissues.org</url>[7] and a myriad of media sources, plus my own accumulated impressions and knowledge from watching these players over the years. Feel free to reach out on Twitter @OyperG[8] for questions or further insight.    Know more about Russia than your friends: Get our free ebook on how the Soviet Union became Putin's Russia. Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[9]RNC Convention Actual Monday speakers include:Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) - (3/10)  Senator Scott on the surface has some redeeming qualities in regards to his faith and stances on abortion[10] and traditional marriage. He was against same-sex marriage and advocated for traditional values. That said, his high ratings with the globalist-friendly Club for Growth are definitely indicative of his broader priorities of putting corporate interests before those of the American citizen. Moreover, his insistence on balanced budgets over the needs of individuals in a time of unprecedented debt utilization by the federal government is useless and acts as many Republicans do as a means of sticking to their 'ideals' rather than using the money the Democrats will spend anyway in a manner that would help the taxpaying American. Lastly, his treachery on the George Floyd, BLM and 'Criminal Justice Reform' family of issues certifies the fact that Scott is nowhere near being an America First member of Congress. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (LA-01) - (6/10) Representative Scalise has some hidden gems with which to work with in becoming an America First Congressman. His stance on abortion is praiseworthy and he's been an advocate for years for naming preborn individuals as 'persons' under the U.S . Constitution. On the economy, he seemed to indicate support for auditing the Federal Reserve[11], which would in no doubt reveal massive self-dealing and undermine the current Corporate Fiscal interests in this country, but his policies on a balanced budget amendment and capping/prioritizing spending leave much to be desired. The wildcard factor of his shooting incident adds an additional point to his AF rating (orig. 5/10) because this guy has impeccable optics and literally took a bullet for us. Representative Matt Gaetz (FL-01) - (7/10) Congressman Gaetz has become a bit of a rising star and a driver of optimism amongst those of us who call ourselves 'America First'. First, he is a young guy who has a short but strong track record on Conservative values. He is in favor of allowing businesses to decide not to do business with same-sex couples, is a pro-life voice, and is against the legalization of marijuana. On top of this, he has called for the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing police officers - something that we desperately need more calls for in this tumultuous era. Unfortunately, he has some room to improve regarding economics and using federal funding to promote economic growth. Finally, the whole Nestor business, while possibly viewed as charming to some, just rings as strange to many, including me, and dinged him a point on this scale. Wishing them well on that. Representative Jim Jordan (OH-04) - (4/10) Congressman Jordan is a bit of a hard one to call one way or the other. First, the guy is always on Fox and is out and about making the rounds on the media defending Trump, so credit to him for that. He has a solid record supporting some traditional social values, such as freedom of speech, traditional marriage, and the pro-life agenda. The downside with him is that he seems to be a total backroom sell-out for corporations and donor interests, and his recent flirtation with Big Tech[12] is a knife in the back of Conservatives online. He could use a little more populism and a little less think tank money. Former Ambassador Nikki Haley - (1/10) A sad choice for the speaking list. A true Neocon's Neocon. She is one of the most hardcore war mongers in the U.S. Government today, and she has a massive list of backroom wheelers and dealers pushing for her to get into power. On top of her clamoring for more eternal wars in the Middle East to help whoever her friends are, she is also vehemently anti-Trump in her rhetoric and actions. For example, take her statement on Trump and Charlottesville[13] in which she attacks the President over a lie and false narrative. For her to be speaking, and placed as a 'highlighted' speaker is indicative of the America Last agenda of the RNC. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel - (8/10) Now here is an example of someone that is exactly what we need in the Republican Party. She comes from a background of someone that should be radically anti-Trump, and I mean Liz Cheney/Meghan McCain type Never Trumpers. She is the daughter of Mitt Romney[14]'s older brother, and even worked on Mitt's campaigns in the past. Now how does someone like that become one of Trump's chosen? Through loyalty. She is constantly on defense for Trump, raising money and has actually blasted her Uncle Mittens for his disloyalty to the President. There isn't much available on her policy positions, but her loyalty to the Don makes her deserving of the 8/10. Georgia State Representative Vernon Jones - (2/10) Frankly I don't have much on State Rep. Jones. He is a Georgia Democrat who has since joined the Trump Train for some reason or another. The only thing of substance I could find that was a good thing was that he opposes illegal immigration. Outside of this, there seems to be some dubious activity in his personal and career lives. Could this be a case of appealing to the enemy for clout? Not sure. Either way, wouldn't call him America First. Amy Johnson Ford - (?/10) I literally spent 5 minutes trying to find who this is, none of the news sites have anything on her either. Does anyone know who this woman is? If I don't know her, I can't call her America First! Kimberly Guilfoyle - (2/10) Could have so used this speaking time to have someone who wasn't a total TPUSA type give a real speech. The only reason she is going to be given time to speak is because she's Trump Jr's girlfriend. She is definitely no paragon of conservative values, and has repeatedly headlined Charlie Kirk's 'Culture War' events, much to the enjoyment of my namesake friends[15]. The only reason she reached a 2/10 was because she used to be Gavin Newsom's wife and that's funny. Natalie Harp - (7/10) This is not an explicitly political pick for a speaker, so I'm giving her an 8/10 on the laurels of her being an excellent vehicle for the messaging necessary on healthcare[16]. Natalie has a rare bone cancer and was a beneficiary of Trump's push on Right-To-Try laws. While not a huge winner on their own, Natalie's messaging on Right-To-Try could prove helpful for people worried about healthcare. Charlie Kirk - (0/10) This guy is the biggest grifter to ever disgrace the Republican party. If you don't know this fact already, watch this video[17]. Kim Klacik - (4/10) Very basic speaker. You can take a look at her campaign's issues[18] page to see that she has literally 5 things that she's running on, and none of them are remotely controversial or pushing anything 'America First'. That said, she is useful for the RNC and the Trump Campaign, and could possibly be molded into something more with a strong helping of populism and actual America First policies. Mark and Patricia McCloskey - (8/10) Another example of speakers that aren't explicitly political, but by virtue of the events that have happened in their lives and the nation recently, they are inherently America First. These people stood their ground and defended their property with their God Given 2nd Amendment Right, and when they were attacked by the leftist government, they went on the offensive instead of backing down to be slowly dissolved and devoured. If they turn out to be good, let's hear more from them. Sean Parnell - (7/10) This guy seems pretty solid, at least according to his site's issues page[19]. He has some economic populism going on with his pro-oil, pro-union background and highlights some social conservatism and traditionalism on the campaign site as well. If he can overcome Conor Lamb's massive donor pool, he could be someone to watch. The one holdback is going to be his military career. While we all love our cops, our law enforcement, our military and certainly believe they're important, often times some of these guys that run on a military background end up being Neocons. Andrew Pollack - (7/10) Another solid example of a single issue speaker that has the potential to make an impact. Andrew's daughter Meadow was killed in a school shooting[20], and in turn he has become an activist and advocate for 2nd Amendment rights. Let's hope he hammers on that and perhaps weaves in some of the Anti-Biden stuff that he's been putting on his Twitter. Donald Trump, Jr. - (7/10) Trump Jr. gets some points because of obvious reasons; he's Trump's 2nd most chad son (behind Barron), is an avid outdoorsman, and has pretty good optics. The only reason I would not call him fully America First is because he has this horrible habit of affiliating with Charlie Kirk and TPUSA, he needs to cut that out and embrace Nationalism. Tanya Weinreis - (6/10) A local businesswoman from Montana who owns a chain of coffee huts. She was impacted by COVID Shutdowns and was the first to receive PPP Aid in Montana. Another non-political voice, but will be useful to counterpunch against the literal chorus of people that tried to pin COVID on Trump. Hopefully she makes the case for opening the country!RNC Convention - Tuesday speakers include:First Lady Melania Trump - (10/10) This woman birthed Barron and speaks like 9 different languages, and she's a supermodel. Based. The Honorable Mike Pompeo - (2/10) It's kind of a shame to watch Mike Pompeo's trajectory. When I checked his Congressional record, he actually had some stuff to work with, including social conservatism and some economic items I could call neutral and not Con. Inc., but when this guy ended up leading the CIA and then the State Dept., things went downhill fast. He is now a full neocon[21] and has led an Executive Branch department that actively undermines the President daily. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) - (3/10) The problem with Rand Paul is that he sounds good until you look at the whole picture. For example, he supports calling preborn individuals as legal persons, but then goes lukewarm on abortion as a whole and supports Plan-B funding. The same goes for almost every issue, and on top of that the guy is a total libertarian. It'd be better if he was a staunch libertarian, but he bends all the time and it's often with a liberal bent. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds - (2/10) If anybody wants to know who to call if Trump loses Iowa, read this[22]. Total betrayer of Conservatism and caved before the BLM mob. Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez - (5/10) I'm going to have to go neutral on Jeanette here. I've read through her ballotpedia page[23] and the only striking thing about it is that it is literally the most lukewarm thing I've ever read. She strikes me as a true run of the mill Republican. Please wake me if I fall asleep during her remarks. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron - (7/10) Not a lot to work with on this guy, however, he has two solid wins in his background for the America First scale's consideration. First, he wanted to ban abortions during the COVID pandemic, under the assumption that they're an elective procedure. This, while small in nature, indicates something about his values. Secondly, he had a large protest come to his house and he subsequently had 87 of them arrested and charged with Class D felonies for Intimidating a person in the Legal Process. We need to have this done to every rioter in our country. A good example, let's hope he talks of Law and Order! Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi - (4/10) While acting as Attorney General of Florida, Pam Bondi had a solid policy background, fighting against corporations and for traditional values. It seems as if that changed after the Pulse Nightclub shooting, after a botched CNN interview. After her stint as AG, she went on to become a Registered Foreign Agent as a lobbyist for Qatar, and also fought as a talk-show host warrior against impeachment. Typical RNC talking head, and definitely not America First. Abby Johnson - (6/10) Abortion activist who will probably make a compelling case as she usually does about her experience as a Planned Parenthood clinic director. I like that she comes across as an insider who discussed why Planned Parenthood is wrong, but I feel like she overplays her hand a bit. Her movie Unplanned was a bit forthright - you need to show why these things are wrong in context, sometimes the straightforward approach is a bit strong. Jason Joyce - (6/10) Seems like a solid dude. Jason is a Maine lobsterman and fisherman and is expected to speak on Trump's environmental and commercial fishing policies. Trump really helped Maine with some recent regulatory activity, so I'm optimistic for this speech for outcomes on the state of Maine. Myron Lizer - (2/10) This is probably the most interesting speaker I've seen on this list. This guy is a big business, Navajo Nation VP who simultaneously supports Israel and unity between the two nations (being Navajo and Israel, not the U.S.) Needless to say, I'm sure Mr. Lizer will not be speaking about anything that can be deemed as beneficial to the American citizen! Mary Ann Mendoza - (10/10) Here is an Angel Mom who is going to absolutely crush it on Illegal Immigration. Her son Brandon was killed by a 3 times the legal limit drunk and high on meth ILLEGAL CRIMINAL![24] Her rhetoric on the immigration debate leads me to put her firmly in the America First category. We need more people like her calling out the immigration problems, both Legal and Illegal, in this country. Megan Pauley - (?/10) Not sure who this is, will need to see what she talks about. Cris Peterson - (?/10) Again, not sure who this is. John Peterson - (?/10) Once more, who is this? Is it the golfer? Nicholas Sandmann - (10/10) This guy is a total Chad. Literally stood in the face of massive leftist media onslaught and then sued the living hell out of them and is now a multi-millionaire. On top of that, he tweets semi-frequently and it's always good content or good responses. Very much looking forward to this speech. Eric Trump - (8/10) Basically this guy is Donald Trump Jr., but without as many TPUSA connections. Let's hope he aligns more with his father in the future and not Javanka[25]. Tiffany Trump - (7/10) Might take a break during this one, sure to be a 'my father has done more for x' type speech.RNC Convention - Wednesday speakers include:Vice President Mike Pence - (9/10) One of Trump's chosen - not exactly entirely based and redpilled in his own right, but he has gone to bat for America First and is a great bridge to establishment conservatives. Second Lady Karen Pence - (9/10) Just going to echo the above comment regarding her husband. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) - (3/10) On the social issues, especially abortion, Senator Blackburn has a stellar record. The problem with her from the America First perspective is the fact that she is likely one of the top 5 Pro-Big Business Congresspeople in the country. She endlessly goes to bat for corporate interests and masks her corporate servitude with some sugary social conservatism treats. We want economic populism, not Conservative Inc.! Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) - (6/10) Senator Ernst could totally be a good Senator fighting for America First if she only changed a few key issues. She has a decent background on traditional values, with some room for improvement on marriage and some crime issues. She supports immigration restriction, wants to cap H1B and family visas (though sometimes this is misleading), and she would be okay with troops on the border 'for logistical purposes'. Unfortunately, she is against raising a minimum wage and seems to be Pro-Big Business and 'Judeo-Christian' values, whatever those are. A bit more economic populism would do her some good, and Iowa would benefit as well! South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem - (8/10) I do not know a lot about Governor Noem, but upon reviewing some of her policy decisions, it looks as if she is pretty solid. She has supported a ban on insider trading based on government information, auditing the Federal Reserve and has some social conservatism highlights that include abstinence education. She has some problems with her support for corporations, but what Republicans nowadays? Representative Dan Crenshaw (TX-02) - (0/10) This guy is the reincarnated ghost of John McCain. Watch this video[26] and tell me you think Dan Crenshaw should ever be elected again or can be called a Conservative. Representative Elise Stefanik (NY-21) - (3/10) She has some individual good items in her background on guns and families but her support of increasing legal immigration caps and her backroom dealing on increasing H1B visas during COVID make her definitively America Last. Representative Lee Zeldin (NY-01) - (8/10) I have to admit that I haven't followed this guy much, but he seems super solid. He's supported such positions as a ban on DREAMers in the military, is pretty pro-2A, and has a great pro-family background including hosting an annual Teach a Kid to Fish Day. As is typical with the GOP, he needs to be more pro-worker, but some individual policies such as his support for investing payroll tax money into individual retirement accounts is a step in the right direction. Former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell - (2/10) The only reason Rick Grenell gets any points at all is because he got the ball rolling on the anti-Trump spying operation by dropping those documents and getting vengeance for the beating that Devin Nunes took. Outside of that, I don't see how pushing all countries to decriminalize homosexuality[27] is America First. Regardless of policy stances, I'm not sure what this guy can do for us as Conservatives if his priority is to force Botswana and Belarus to allow Pride parades. The Honorable Kellyanne Conway - (6/10) She's been around the block fighting for Trump. She's a solid orator and is going to give another run of the mill speech supporting the President. Really getting sick of her daughter's Tweets about their family drama. This woman's husband should be in jail for being a deadbeat. Update (8/23/20) Kellyanne is going to be leaving the administration come the end of the month. Curious to see how this plays out both long-term in the admin / who will replace her (if she needs replacing), how Trump handles messaging, if she will speak badly of him afterwards, and if she will speak at the convention this week. Interesting developments! The Honorable Keith Kellogg - (7/10) Military man and Lt. General who is Pence's National Security Advisor. Not a lot of information around other than that he was more Pro-Trump than Pence's last pick, and it seems as if he is on board with Trump's Middle East withdrawal and Trump's increasing China Hawk mentality. Could be America First, but we will have to see when he speaks. Jack Brewer - (5/10) Fox News favorite - he is going to get up, talk about his football career and why kneeling for the anthem is wrong. Here's the deal, Jack - I want to hear about why Colin Kaepernick should be put in jail, not why he is morally wrong for kneeling and being Anti-America! Sister Dede Byrne - (9/10) This woman is an absolute legend. She was a Colonel in the military, then after retiring lived a religious life and a Doctor. I'm talking about Mother Theresa vibes. Looking forward to her speech. Here's a quick article[28] on her. Madison Cawthorn - (4/10) Very lukewarm kind of guy. Hopefully he wins his election because we need the seats, but he comes off as a total Country Club, Club for Growth brand, Paul Ryan Lab Grown Republican. He has the cool background story of his paralysis and great optics, along with his curious Fuhrer-posting[29], but I don't think he is going to become an America First paragon anytime soon. I wonder if another trip to the Eagle's Nest can fix that! (Sarcasm people.) Scott Dane - (6/10) Another non-political pick. Scott is a logger from Minnesota. It seems that Trump is really making a big play for Minnesota. I hope after the Nationwide rioting that was sparked in Minnesota that the people of Minnesota are receptive to the Trump message, and that we kept enough Somalis out[30] of the State to maintain election integrity. Clarence Henderson - (3/10) This is going to be a BLM pander speech. While the hope is that this 'principled protester from the civil rights era' will be able to discuss with the Black Community[31] why the rioting is wrong, can we seriously be expected to think this pandering will counteract the race hatred on display from the Democrats? On top of that, this guy is likely going to talk about 'justice for George Floyd', who died of a Fentanyl overdose. Ryan Holets - (7/10) A true American. A police officer from New Mexico who adopted the baby of an Opioid addicted woman that he found behind a gas station. He represents what we need to do in this nation - help our own people and most importantly, our own children. Michael McHale - (6/10) National Assoc. Of Police Organizations President. Going to be a decent speech on Pro-Police/Anti-Rioter topic for sure. The only dilemma I can see here is that this guy seems like a total insider friendly with both sides, so I hope he doesn't go the whole 'Justice for George Floyd' route, and instead sides with Daniel Cameron (see above on the list) with arresting the criminals. Burgess Owens - (9/10) I've kept my eye on Burgess Owens for a while. An ex-football player running for Congress in Utah, he is running on a staunchly Conservative platform. His campaign site[32] outlines a ton of different policy positions, almost all of them are Pro-American. He can improve on some things, but for someone running for Congress, in Utah of all places, this is an awesome platform to see develop. I'll let his page on Illegal Immigration speak for itself: Our focus should always be to protect Americans first. Lara Trump - (7/10) A big campaigner for the President and Eric Trump's wife. She focuses almost primarily on the Woman vote, specifically targeting suburban and urban wives and mothers. I kind of find that her voice is siloed a bit and I wonder if she could be utilized in a manner other than endless 'Women for Trump!' webinars. On top of that, her and Eric just had their second child and she has strong slavic blood. Good for them and may God bless their blossoming family.RNC Convention - Thursday speakers include:President Donald J. Trump - (11/10) To quote from his 2016 speech, which I hope he one-ups this year, 'The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.' I hope he adds some Patrick Buchanan '92 speech elements[33] to juice it up just a bit more. Remember, from this day, forward, we are going to put AMERICA FIRST! The Honorable Ben Carson - (8/10) This guy is pretty solid. While he is literally some sort of sleep-creature that is likely going to be used to put the elderly to sleep before they get to Ivanka, Jared and Ja'Ron, he has a great background as a surgeon and is totally Pro-American. He's been a great HUD secretary and has simultaneously helped urban areas and kept blight out of suburbs and various communities rather than transplanting low income housing into middle class neighborhoods. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) - (2/10) This guy is a total grifter. I would argue that he is the single most bought and paid for individual in the U.S. Senate. The case can be made that he has gotten 300+ judges confirmed, and 2 justices and this, that and the other thing. Then you see decisions like this[34] one, in which the much ballyhooed Gorsuch betrays Conservative values he was nominated to defend. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) - (6/10) As a whole, I'd argue that Senator Cotton is more of a good influence than a bad one on the Republican party. While the guy is a total big-business, pro-demographic replacement, Iraq War supporting Neocon, he also has a lot of great one-off policies on the domestic front. He wants to audit and trim *all* federal agencies, supports work / drug testing requirements for welfare, and is pretty staunch on his anti-self dealing policies within government. He is also pro-2A and is a China Hawk. Additionally, he seems to be pro-vitality and pro-fitness and is the fastest man in Congress, which earns him a bonus point. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23) - (2/10) This guy puts up a big front and tries to come off as Pro Trump but it is so widely and readily known that he is a clone spliced from Mitch McConnel and Paul Ryan. This guy is a total establishment insider and a true Never Trumper. The perfect example of the difference between Trump and McCarthy is how they handled the QAnon Question, in which Trump brushed it off and said it would be a good thing if he was hunting satanist pedophiles. McCarthy said QAnon was dangerous and a vile conspiracy[35], among other things, which goes directly against our base. Representative Jeff Van Drew (NJ-02) - (1/10) This guy is literally left of Joe Biden[36], but likes Trump personally and switched parties because he didn't like that the Democrats were being mean to Trump. Go down the list, this guy is Pro-Abortion, Anti-2A, and a litany of other Anti-American policies fill this guys C.V. Get him off the stage! The Honorable Ivanka Trump - (3/10) Ivanka is representative of everything that is wrong with the Trump administration. Her and her husband, Jared, constantly undermine the President's nationalist policies. They are pro-immigration, pro-criminal, and pro-BLM. They do not support anything that Trump supports and are liberals amongst themselves. This article[37] discusses Jared, but applies to both Ivanka and her husband. They need to be taken out of the administration in anything but an honorific role! The Honorable Ja'Ron Smith - (2/10) Ja'Ron Smith is the vehicle that Jared and Ivanka use to make Trump pander to the BLM mob and the vortex of policies that surround it end up making their way into Executive Orders through this vehicle. Ja'Ron is the person who helped champion 'Criminal Justice Reform', that allowed thousands of criminals out of the prisons, many of whom committed murders, rapes, and other violent crimes. This guy is not a conservative, is not for law and order, and should not be speaking or in the Trump administration. Ann Dorn - (7/10) Ann Dorn is the widow of slain St. Louis police captain David Dorn[38]. I hope this speech will be one in a broader theme amongst the Republicans that highlight the need for law and order. She has the potential to make a strong case - these violent criminals murdered her husband, I hope she's out for blood. Debbie Flood - (6/10) Debbie is the President of Melron Corp, a Wisconsin company that sells architectural hardware. Similar to the other non-political speakers mentioned previously that are from Maine and Minnesota, this seems to be an attempt to play for Wisconsin by addressing the women and business owners that are upset with their State's leadership, especially during COVID. Rudy Giuliani - (8/10) Rudy is a classic fixture of Conservative politics. The guy is a total master of Law and Order and is almost certain to give a rousing speech on the topic. I hope he absolutely blasts the criminals rampaging across the country. It would be doubly great to see him discuss the destruction of statues and monuments as well - he could, and should, do so Franklin Graham - (10/10) This is kind of a non-political pick by virtue of the work that he does, but as a follower of Christ myself, I am obligated to give this man a 10/10. He does great work for charity and Samaritan's Purse is a great organization. This will be a good speech regarding COVID and Charity work that Trump has done for sure. God Bless Franklin Graham. Alice Johnson - (1/10) I hope that Jared and Ivanka are on stage with her as she gives her speech just to indicate who is in charge. This criminal cocaine trafficker was pardoned by Trump after Javanka met with Kim Kardashian. This woman ran a multi-million dollar drug ring[39] and because she had a sob story and his precious Ivanka pushed him, Trump agreed to pardon her. We can't take these kinds of actions anymore, and her speech is going to be a step in the direction of more 'Criminal Justice Reform' and away from Law and Order. Stop this nonsense! Wade Mayfield - (5/10) Not entirely sure on this guy's identity, but it looks like he is a businessman from Omaha, Nebraska who runs a large HVAC company and professional organization for the industry. Likely to be another speech on COVID benefits under Trump, necessary but uninspiring. Carl and Marsha Mueller - (10/10) This is going to be a tearjerker I'm sure. Carl and Marsha are the parents of Kayla Mueller, who was taken captive and killed[40] by ISIS. I expect them to tout the President's achievements in the Middle East, particularly of the total decimation of ISIS and Abu Bakr Al-Bagdadi. They have a very touching story on how the operation to kill Al-Bagdadi was named after their daughter. Talk about delivering vengeance - this is the kind of thing we need more of. Dana White - (8/10) Dana White is a total chad. He runs UFC and has made a ton of money and has become friends with Trump. When he first remotely signaled support for the President, the media absolutely jumped on him and he shrugged them off. The experience only pushed him closer to Trump and while he is kind of a neutral party, he, like his comrade at Barstool Sports (see below), is a well recognized public voice for the President. People love Dana White.Who SHOULD be on the RNC list:There are a number of people who have been excluded from the event that I would love to see, and that objectively should speak to make the case for America First, or at minimum Pro-Trump policies. Paul Gosar - (8/10) This guy is a vocal America First Congressman and is often on Twitter voicing those opinions. He has great social conservative values, supports controlling government graft and crime, and is seemingly pro-American worker via his immigration proposals, such as keeping illegals out of the military. He has some room to grow with his national security policy (i.e. renewing Patriot Act), but as a whole I think he would make a great speaker and proponent of our ideas and values. Tucker Carlson - (10/10) Tucker is literally the icon of America First in mainstream politics today. His show consistently blows out ratings record and he is THE only person on any major media outlet that talks about values in a non-partisan way. He is totally unafraid of skewering Republicans and Democrats alike when they go against the American citizen, and it's not just on economic topics. He recently blasted[41] Cardi B's degenerate 'WAP' song, as well as Netflix[42]'s predatory child-grooming 'Cuties' film. I truly hope he runs and is supported by the GOP in 2024. He'd crush anyone running against him as long as he isn't co-opted. Dave Portnoy - (7/10) The primary reason I'd like to see this is because the guy is funny as hell. Outside of that, he has a huge connection to younger people and seeing him speak here would be a relatability link for many people that would otherwise be uninterested. Finally, he is against COVID lockdown restrictions and has been speaking out against them for months. He would be a powerful voice against the Democrat messaging that Trump is responsible for COVID. Patrick Buchanan - (10/10) Just to take the place of some of the other speakers that are total Neocons, I'd like to see a genuine patriot and populist like Pat Buchanan take to the podium. We need more voices like his in the party, and his speech would be a great complement to Trump's speech as long as Trump stays on the America First line. Perhaps we can still cancel Ja'Ron's remarks and bring it the Buchanan Brigade! Nicholas J. Fuentes - (10/10) This one is obviously for the hell of it because AIPAC would airstrike the convention hall before they allowed this to happen. That said, in the event that Nick was allowed to speak, I know that he would lay down a flaming, firebrand speech[43] like he did at his AFPAC event last year. I can't think of anyone in politics these days that speaks the truth as clearly, as fully, and as powerfully as Nick does, and I pray for the day that his voice can be boosted by institutions. He does a show on DLive[44] during the week, Monday-Friday at 9PM EST. If you consider yourself America First you should totally check it out. You might be offended at first, but he is not wrong.ConclusionThat's it - if you can think of anyone else that should be included or any other in's and out's on the individual speakers listed, again, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @OyperG. I'd like to again reiterate that the RNC supported speakers, all of the Congressmen and Establishment 'Conservatives', these are the people that are America Last. They do not want the individual American to succeed, they care only for their pockets and their power. The individual speakers like the Muellers[45], Ann Dorn[46], and all of the small business owners from around the Nation are likely sourced from Trump channels, and these speakers are the ones to watch for their America First perspectives. We need more champions for our Nation and for our People, not for our Corporations.
