The Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles makes millions of dollars per year selling Vermonters' personal data, according to records analyzed by VTDigger[5].

'This is a standard way for the DMV to generate revenue,' Cox said, 'even if the people \u2014 that is, drivers \u2014 who provide the information in the first place aren't necessarily aware of it.' A push is now underway to tighten the Driver Privacy Protection Act, the 1994 federal law that regulates the sale of DMV data. Some lawmakers and privacy advocates are pushing to remove private investigators from the list of parties that are eligible to buy personal information. (About 50 P.I.s are authorized to purchase data in Vermont.) Cox attributed the renewed attention on this law to a shift in how people view personal information. Recent scandals, like Cambridge Analytica's illicit harvesting of Facebook user data, have brought new scrutiny to privacy issues. 'People pay much, much more attention to this \u2014 to even seemingly innocuous data such as your name, physical address, and maybe some contact information,' Cox said. 'When this law first came about in 1994, we were in a much different place, privacy-wise, than we are today.' On this week's podcast, Cox discusses his reporting on DMV data for Motherboard. VTDigger's Xander Landen breaks down how the practice plays out in Vermont. Michael Smith, the Vermont DMV's operations director, describes why his department sells personal information. And Susan Randall, a Vermont private investigator, explains how access to data can serve as a check on law enforcement.**Podcast transcript**This week: Records show that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles makes millions of dollars every year selling Vermonters' personal data. The DMV says this is a routine practice that's totally legal. But privacy advocates have raised questions about whether that access could be abused. Xander Landen: Let's see what we've got here. Armstrong Investigations and Consulting Services LLC out of Guilderland, New York. Boucher Private Investigations out of Montpelier, here in town. BlackRock Investigations Group. Boathistoryreport.com Our reporter Xander Landen has been looking into this practice. Xander Landen: Censor Security, Inc., in Rutland. Carfax. You know Carfax. Yeah, who doesn't. Xander, what is this list? Xander Landen: What I've got here is a list of the roughly 750 companies that the state of Vermont, specifically the Vermont DMV, has approved to buy the personal data of Vermont drivers since 2004. So it's everyone who's been approved. Have these people all gotten data? Xander Landen: That, unfortunately, from this list, I do not know. What I do know is that these are all the people that the state has said, you're cleared to buy the personal data of Vermonters. And that data ranges from data that \u2014 when you submit a license application, or \u2014 with the exception of your social security number, and then anything about vehicle registration, anything about the criminal history that they may have on file, your driving history. Whether you've been stopped, you have traffic tickets, you have a DWI. You have points on your license or points against your license because of your driving history. The DMV collects a lot of information about drivers in the state. They have a lot of information that they maintain. They also make a lot of money selling that information to private companies. How much money are we talking about? Xander Landen: For the last three years or so it's been about $4 million each year. You met with officials from the Vermont DMV to talk about this practice. What did they tell you? Xander Landen: I talked to Michael Smith at the DMV. He's the operations manager there. And he and he said that this is an extremely common practice. Michael Smith: I don't know all 50 states, but I have never heard and I've been to many conferences with all the states. I've never heard of any state that said, 'no, we've locked everything down. We don't give it out.' Xander Landen: All DMVs across the country sell the data that consumers and drivers give to them when they register their vehicles and then sign up to become licensed drivers in a state. This is a very common practice, and it's a practice that's set up under federal law. Michael Smith: So DPPA, right \u2014 the Driver Privacy Protection Act \u2014 sets up various permissible uses for private information. And this is \u2014 it's a federal law or whatever, it sets up various different ones. Xander Landen: Federal law allows for DMVs to sell this information. And they're required, in many cases, to sell the information \u2014 to companies like insurance firms, insurance companies, and trucking companies and auto manufacturers. It's important in many cases. Think about, you know, cases where you have recalls of vehicle parts. Michael Smith: While the recall that says that your floor mat's going to hold your gas pedal down seems rather serious, well, people wouldn't have found out about it. Think about that \u2014 is it Takata airbags that were blowing up on people? That wouldn't have got out. You know what I mean? Xander Landen: You have companies like Carfax that are trying to make accurate reports about the state of a vehicle or a vehicle's history. They sort of rely on this information. Michael Smith: So when you go buy a car, you run your Carfax. You see the little car fox or whatever on TV, right? So you run the VIN and say, okay, this thing's got a flood brand on it. I don't want to buy that. Xander Landen: There's companies that rely on this information, and DMVs have to give it to these companies. So they're inherently going to be making money from those sorts of companies. But where DMVs have a little more discretion is with other sorts of private companies. Like who? Xander Landen: Well, one thing that's interesting is that there are about 50 private investigators on this list \u2014 private investigation firms that go to the DMV on a frequent basis to get information to investigate people on behalf of their clients. Michael Smith: DPPA is set up with 'shall' and 'may,' right? Okay, so there's, you know, what the definition of shall and may is? Xander Landen: Sure. Michael Smith: Shall is you're gonna do it, may is you don't have to. You can if you want. So, there are sections that talk about shall and may. Shall: we shall provide to vehicle manufacturers and people that are going to send stuff on your safety recalls. That's a shall, right? And I believe the others that are listed in there are may. Xander Landen: Private investigators rely on the DMV to get information about where people they're looking into live, whether the people they're looking into have a criminal history. There aren't that many big out of state companies that are on this list, but there are a few. There's Deloitte, which is a huge financial consulting firm. You have Aristotle International Inc. here, which is a company that self identifies as a company that mines data to help political campaigns. Michael Smith: So the DMV's position would be that the federal government has established regulations and we try to comply with them the best that we can. When there is a 'may' we would exercise our judgment to say, do we believe this is an appropriate use or do we not, right? Xander Landen: The reason I think this is interesting and worth scrutiny is because I don't think that most Vermonters, when they walk into the DMV and sign up to become a licensed driver in the state or to register their vehicle, know necessarily that that information is not only being maintained by the DMV, but could be sold by the DMV to companies that request it. Now there are, like I said, strict standards and requirements. They're not just going to sell it to anyone that asks. But the fact that the DMV has a lot of personal information and are profiting off of it is interesting.Xander Landen: There was a recent report in Vice News highlighting how DMVs sell the information, particularly sell it to private investigators, that put this whole practice in the news again. It's what inspired me to look into this locally. Joseph Cox: Every DMV that we got records back from was selling this data in some capacity. Some were selling it in bulk and others were focused on sales to individual entities or businesses, but very generally speaking, it seems to be pretty widespread. This is Joseph Cox, the reporter who investigated this story for Vice. Joseph Cox: This is a standard way for the DMV to generate revenue, even if the people \u2014 that is, drivers \u2014 who provide the information the first place aren't necessarily aware of it. Joseph said there's a push underway to make changes to that federal law Mike Smith was talking about, the DPPA. Joseph Cox: When I spoke to someone from Epic, a privacy activism group, they said that this is a federal law, or one of federal laws, that should be updated in 2019, with our renewed focus on privacy. Generally speaking, what they suggested was that some of the exemptions could be taken out, specifically the private investigator one. It is one thing to be selling information for companies that need to recall vehicles that may be defective, that seems like a legitimate use case. It's another to be selling to private investigators, who can then essentially do whatever they want with it. His reporting revealed that in other states, DMVs have admitted that this level of access has led to abuse. Joseph Cox: When we also spoke to DMVs earlier in the year, multiple agencies did confirm that the data has been abused, and that they had to cut off entities. So it's not like this is a theoretical issue. It is actually happening. Of course, there are legitimate use cases of this data, and it is being used legitimately. But there is still the risk and the apparent history of abuse there as well. Xander Landen: In response to it, Bernie Sanders, our senator came out and called on DMVs to stop profiting off of data. Joseph Cox: And he put it in the wider context of you know, the internet is this amazing thing with connectivity, but there's the side effects of more and more data being available for sale and for purchase. We got similar responses from other senators as well, but then also digital privacy experts saying that, you know, this law needs to be changed. It keeps coming back to the DPPA, this anachronistic federal statute which just doesn't really sit with where we are in 2019 when it comes with privacy, and the selling of data, and how that data can be abused. Xander Landen: I talked to the ACLU about this, and they basically said that the practice at a minimum deserves a lot more scrutiny, a lot more oversight and transparency. The public deserves to know about why and how the information is being used. That's their argument. Then I also called Susan Randall, who's a private investigator who relies actively on this information, purchasing this information. And like I said, there are about 50 private investigators on this list. So I wanted to hear from one of them, specifically, why do you need this information? And she had a really interesting argument. Susan Randall: In my world, I believe that open government is good government. In other words, I believe in open access to information: anything that law enforcement and prosecutors are able to access, I believe that we should be able to access. Xander Landen: She's talking about how she works for public defenders and criminal defense attorneys who, as part of their work, they need to look into the credibility of witnesses called into court, for example, or the credibility of the case that a law enforcement officer or a prosecutor is making against a witness. And that requires the ability to investigate the people that are being called into court and the facts that law enforcement are bringing to the table. Susan Randall: The reason I get hired \u2014 so let's say you're accused of a crime, and it's a state crime. Either the state police or local law enforcement will be working with the prosecutor. On our side, it'll be like you're appointed a public defender from the state or a federal defender. Or if you have money, you hire an attorney. They then hire me. So I'm sort of a check and balance on what the police and the prosecutors are able to access. I think just as a civil liberties issue, it's really important for us to have access to the same information that the other branch of government has. In other words, you don't want to be on the hot seat being accused of a crime and not able to then look into the witnesses that are testifying against you. Xander Landen: The overarching message that she kept saying is that law enforcement officers should not be the only people that have the ability to access this information that's kept by the government. That there needs to be some channel for an independent investigator, an independent person, to be able to come in and also be able to conduct independent investigations of these people. Susan Randall: That said, do you have corrupt prosecutors that have access to everybody's information and screw it up and go off the rails? You know, yeah, sure. It's like 'The Wire.' Do you have corrupt officials? Do you have corrupt private eyes that can break all the rules and get sanctioned and lose their license? Sure. But in my experience in the last 20 years, that's not what I see happening. I see people using it for the right reasons. And I'd actually like to see it not cost the average Joe, the middle class person that needs this information for their family court hearing or criminal defense, not have to hire me to go drive there, park my car, go inside, wait in line. It would be much better if you're a licensed P.I. and you can get the information online the same way that law enforcement can. I mean, that's just an equity issue. Xander Landen: She compared our system to the system in Russia. She said that she was recently overseas, she needed to look into some case in Russia, and how there, there's no way to access this kind of information about people. Susan Randall: The only people that have access to anyone's information are just, like, Putin's police. I was like, you're kidding me. Really? There's no database? There's no way that I can find where Svetlana's living in this apartment building? Xander Landen: Here at least there's a channel, and it's a highly regulated channel. It's not like anyone or any private investigator for any reason can go in and use it. You have to have specific reasons. In her case, she's only investigating people that are involved in criminal or civil cases in court. She also made the point that maybe it would be better if our information in general, private information, was kept private. But the world that we live in has already changed to the point where that's really not possible. Susan Randall: Anymore, the world that we're in right now, everybody's information is available all over the place to everybody. My point being, I think it's really, really dangerous to have only certain parts of our system have access to that information and not others. It's either all out there or it's not out there. And there's no putting the horse back in the in the stall at this point. It's all out there. Xander Landen: Big tech companies have basically eroded the possibility of us ever attaining or retaining true privacy anymore, and because of that, it makes no sense to sort of limit other actors like private investigators from accessing it. In fact, it's only dangerous to cut off some sort of channel for the public or an independent actor to be able to access it. But Joseph Cox, the Vice reporter, said this change in how we look at personal data and privacy is exactly why the law that regulates DMV data is under new scrutiny. Joseph Cox: When this law first came about in 1994, we were in a much different place, privacy-wise, than we are today. So I mean, we even had stories like the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal where third parties were getting access to data without, necessarily, users' consent \u2014 that story would not have been around 10 years ago, in my opinion. I don't think journalists would have necessarily written it. And I don't think people would have probably really cared about it. Now, that's happened. And after that, we've seen a wave of more privacy-focused stories. Which is not to say that journalists weren't covering privacy before that. But it's even more front of mind now, and we have politicians talking about it much more aggressively. It's a great time for professional activist groups that have been on this issue as well. This DMV story kind of fits into, in my opinion, this post-Cambridge Analytica landscape of privacy. People pay much, much more attention to this \u2014 to even seemingly innocuous data such as your name, physical address, and maybe some contact information. We're not talking about passwords, we're not talking about photos or social security numbers. This is, as far as it comes, you know, pretty basic biographical demographic data, but it is still a privacy-centric story, especially in 2013. Xander, having dug into this for a couple of weeks and found out a lot more detail about this \u2014 even though it's been going on for a long time \u2014 what's your takeaway here? Xander Landen: I think it's easy to look at this and raise questions about, why is the government selling personal information to companies, you know, private actors, and sort of feel like that might not be a good thing. But I think that there are arguments to suggest that it's an important and essential practice. I think there are questions to be raised for certain privacy concerns. But there are also arguments that Susan Randall, the private investigator, made, that DMV officials made, to say that this is an important channel for certain businesses and companies that rely on this information to receive it in a way that, without the DMV, they wouldn't otherwise have it. It was interesting how Susan kind of tied it to this broader conversation around data \u2014 how the world around data has changed, the way we think about data has changed. Xander Landen: I think that that's why I wanted to look into this, right? Because it's a given that Google and Facebook, at this point, it's a given that they're using our information for profit \u2014 for a variety of reasons that are driven by profit. And when you see that the state is making millions of dollars profiting off of our private information, that inherently raises questions. And that's why I looked into this. But I think there are a series of arguments to be made for why this is an important practice. And I think, you know, Susan Randall, the private investigator, has a point that we've reached a point in our society where the information, or private information, is pretty much out the window. I don't know if we're ever going to have the same privacy that we had in the 1990s, or even five or 10 years ago. The information is likely already out there. That doesn't mean that I think the state should be profiting off of it. The argument has already been made by our one of our senators that this is an inappropriate use of our personal information. But it certainly isn't anything new. It's been going on for four decades. It's legal. And I don't think it's going to stop anytime soon. Got it. Thanks, Xander.

The personal-computer revolution was just beginning. He invested in Electronic Arts (now a leading video-game maker) and Sybase (a pioneering database firm), among others, eventually running one of the most successful funds in the industry. In 1991, he partnered with the venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins, where he listened to pitches for Netscape and Amazon. He invested in those companies, too, and a few years later he co-founded Silver Lake Partners. The businesses in Silver Lake's portfolio now produce two hundred and thirty billion dollars in annual revenue and employ three hundred and seventy thousand people. In the early two-thousands, McNamee helped create a private-equity firm, Elevation Partners, which invested two hundred and ten million dollars in Facebook in 2009 and 2010, two years before it went public.</p><p>If the founders of Big Tech were a family, McNamee might be its eccentric uncle. A longtime guitarist who still plays some fifty shows a year, he has toured for more than two decades with an evolving cast of venture capitalists, technologists, and career musicians such as Pete Sears, of Jefferson Starship. On tracks like the stoner anthem \"It's 4:20 Somewhere,\" by his band Moonalice, McNamee performed under the stage name Chubby Wombat.</p><p>McNamee has mentored many of the people who have transformed Silicon Valley. In 2006, when Facebook was a two-year-old company with less than fifty million dollars in annual revenue, McNamee advised Mark Zuckerberg to turn down Yahoo's offer to buy it for a billion dollars. (It's now worth more than five hundred billion.) Not long afterward, he encouraged Zuckerberg to hire Sheryl Sandberg. His acquaintances have included Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, who was an investor at Silver Lake.</p><p>McNamee saw the tech industry as an experiment in creative and profitable problem-solving. He grew unnerved by its ethical failures only in 2012, when Uber came to him for investment capital. He decided that Silicon Valley had changed. \"These guys all wanted to be monopolists,\" he said recently. \"They all want to be billionaires.\"</p><p>McNamee was convinced that Facebook was different. Then, in February, 2016, shortly after he retired from full-time investing, he noticed posts in his Facebook feed that purported to support Bernie Sanders but struck him as fishy. That spring, the social-media-fuelled vitriol of the Brexit campaign seemed like further proof that Facebook was being exploited to sow division among voters-and that company executives had turned a blind eye. The more McNamee listened to Silicon Valley critics, the more alarmed he became: he learned that Facebook allowed facial-recognition software to identify users without their consent, and let advertisers discriminate against viewers. (Real-estate companies, for example, could exclude people of certain races from seeing their ads.)</p><p>Ten days before the Presidential election, McNamee sent an e-mail to Zuckerberg and Sandberg. \"I am disappointed. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed,\" he wrote.</p><p>Recently, Facebook has done some things that are truly horrible and I can no longer excuse its behavior.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Facebook is enabling people to do harm. It has the power to stop the harm. What it currently lacks is an incentive to do so.</p><p>Within hours, both Zuckerberg and Sandberg sent McNamee cordial replies, assuring him that they were already working to address some of the issues he'd raised, and dispatched a Facebook executive, Dan Rose, to talk to him. Rose told McNamee that Facebook was a platform, not a publisher, and couldn't control all user behavior. Since leaving the investment world, McNamee had been looking forward to being a full-time musician. But Rose's dismissiveness rattled him. \"They were my friends. I wanted to give them a chance to do the right thing. I wasn't expecting them to go, 'Oh, my God, stop everything,' but I was expecting them to take it seriously,\" he said. \"It was obvious they thought it was a P.R. problem, not a business problem, and they thought the P.R. problem was me.\" McNamee hasn't spoken to Sandberg or Zuckerberg since. (Both declined to comment for this article.) He now refers to Zuckerberg as an \"authoritarian.\"</p><p>As Russian election interference became increasingly apparent, McNamee published a series of op-eds-in the Guardian, USA Today, Time, and elsewhere-arguing that the social-media business model thrived on divisive rhetoric: the more extreme the content, the more users shared it; the more the algorithms amplified it, the more ad revenue was generated. McNamee also scheduled meetings with policymakers, investors, and Silicon Valley executives. He and Nancy Pelosi, now the Speaker of the House, had been introduced some twenty years earlier, by the Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, and McNamee set out to expand his network of Washington contacts. As lawmakers prepared for hearings about Russian meddling, in the fall of 2017, McNamee put together a curriculum for them, which he jokingly called \"Internet Platforms 101.\" Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, had been focussed on foreign manipulation of social media, but, in a meeting, McNamee urged him to consider a broader problem-how\u00a0the platforms were sowing discord among Americans. \"Roger was really ahead of the curve,\" Schiff said. \"Time has borne out his warnings.\"</p><p>McNamee's zeal for diagnosing problems soon evolved into a mission to devise a solution. He argued that piecemeal regulation would never get to the root of the problem: mining users' private data for profit. In February, 2019, McNamee published \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\"-part memoir, part manifesto. He then embarked on a book tour that has turned into an ongoing public-shaming campaign. He has taken his message to bookstores, breweries, high-school gymnasiums, and college campuses. He estimates that he's made his pitch to more than three hundred audiences in the past year. \"I have a hippie value system,\" McNamee told me recently. \"I'm always going to speak truth to power.\"</p><p>McNamee is not the first Silicon Valley insider to become a critic of the tech industry, but he may be the most strenuous. Kara Swisher, a co-founder of the tech-news site Recode and a New York Times columnist, recalled, \"Whenever I would say negative things about Facebook, I'd always get a text or a call from Roger.\" Now, she continued, McNamee is \"sort of shunned\" in the Valley. Last winter, Bill Gates told Forbes, \"I think what Roger has said is completely unfair and kind of outrageous. They're blaming Mark for everything.\" Swisher thinks the Valley has been eager to portray McNamee as \"off the rails.\" As she sees it, \"He's a little wacky, but he's not crazy. The more they make fun of him, the more I'm, like, He's one-hundred-per-cent right.\"</p><p>Among some skeptics, however, the profit McNamee has accrued from the technology that he now urges us to renounce makes him difficult to trust. One view of McNamee is that he has the gravitas of a man willing to admit that he was wrong. (\"Shame on me,\" he told one interviewer.) Another is that, having successfully ridden one wave, he is trying to ride another.</p><p>Earlier this year, I met McNamee for breakfast in Baltimore, where he was speaking to the staff of his former employer T.\u00a0Rowe Price. In 2011, the company had invested a hundred and ninety million dollars in Facebook. \"A lot of people are mad at me,\" McNamee said, in a hotel on the waterfront. On his speaking circuit, he wears baggy suits, clunky black shoes, and round glasses. Before his book tour, he trimmed his shoulder-length curls. At the hotel's restaurant, a hostess greeted us and politely asked for McNamee's name.</p><p>\"Why do you need my name?\" he barked. The woman stuttered a reply, but McNamee cut her off. \"Can we just get a table?\"</p><p>He turned to me with a smirk. \"Privacy!\" he stage-whispered.</p><p>McNamee is not a kombucha kind of Californian. He ordered a Diet Coke with his eggs and toast. As we ate, conversation veered from the civil-rights movement, which he says inspired his tech activism, to the number of Grateful Dead shows he attended before Jerry Garcia died (two hundred). Describing the arc of his career, McNamee attributed his business success mainly to \"dumb luck.\" Talk turned to Bono, whom he met through Sandberg in 2001, and with whom he co-founded Elevation Partners. \"Bono said to me, more than once, 'Your superpower is you're not motivated by money,'\u00a0\" McNamee told me. \"That's the only reason I could do this.\"</p><p>McNamee rattles off a frighteningly long list of things that he believes have been \"Zucked\": \"your vote,\" \"your rights,\" \"your privacy,\" \"your life,\" \"everything.\" So far, the public is less alarmed. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that around half of Americans think that the tech industry is having a positive impact on society. (However, this view is on the decline: in 2015, seven in ten thought so.) Earlier this year, Google and Amazon came in second and third in a survey of millennials' favorite brands. In general, people are more concerned about the behavior of banks and pharmaceutical companies, and most Americans have yet to meaningfully change their habits as tech consumers. McNamee's message resonates most with a few relatively insular groups of worried citizens: parents who monitor screen time, socialists who decry West Coast inequality, academics who study algorithmic bias.</p><p>At this year's Truth About Tech conference, held in April, at Georgetown University, I found McNamee slumped in a chair clutching a Diet Coke. \"This is my fourteenth city in fourteen days,\" he said. Jim Steyer-brother of Tom Steyer, the hedge-fund billionaire turned environmentalist and Presidential candidate-arrived and embraced McNamee. Steyer, who has a blond mane and a California vibe, heads the kids-and-tech advocacy group Common Sense Media. (In one of its recent P.S.A.s, featuring the Muppets, Cookie Monster eats a smartphone.) \"What Roger is doing is so inspiring!\" Steyer told me.</p><p>After listening to a roster of high-powered speakers-the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey, commissioners of the F.T.C. and the F.C.C., and the attorney general of Washington, D.C.-McNamee descended to a basement room where Peter Lord, a vice-president at the software company Oracle, which is worth nearly two hundred billion dollars, had the innards of an Android phone splayed out on a table. McNamee told me, theatrically, \"You can stay, but this is off the record.\" Lord regarded me sternly. (I later found most of what Lord discussed in a YouTube video of a talk he gave last year.) A tangle of wires led from the disassembled Android to a laptop, where data from the phone's sensors appeared, updating each second. This amount of data, Lord explained, gesturing at the screen clogged with numbers, was routinely collected on each of Google Android's approximately two billion users.</p><p>A technician picked up a small black component and waved it in the air. The numbers on the screen danced accordingly: this was the phone's barometric-pressure sensor, sensitive to changes in elevation. Androids are commonly equipped with a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetic-field detector; their sensors can calculate heart rate and count steps. This constant flow of information allows your phone to track whether you're sleeping or awake; whether you're driving, walking, jogging, or biking; whether you're in the Starbucks on the ground floor or the lawyer's office on the tenth. Lord delivered a TED-like slide presentation, which included creepy quotes from Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman: \"We can more or less guess what you're thinking about.\"</p><p>For Oracle, the privacy wars have provided an opportunity to stand up for users' interests while also advancing its own-in particular, by dramatizing the vulnerabilities of its rivals. If Google is broken up, Oracle is better positioned to thrive. During the past two years, Oracle has given the same presentation that McNamee and I received to lawmakers and regulators, who, Lord said, were \"clearly frustrated\" by what they learned.</p><p>All modern smartphones-including iPhones-contain hardware that monitors users' activities and locations. But McNamee and many experts argue that Androids are unique in the extent to which they collect and retain user information. Much of this data is collected even when a phone is off-line, then uploaded to Google's servers and integrated into an archive that includes your search, Gmail, and Google Docs history. The Android platform finds information in your apps and your online activity, and often makes this information available to third parties, like advertisers. A user agreement also gives Google Assistant the right to record conversations that occur within earshot of the device's microphone.</p><p>Using digital profiles to predict and influence our behavior is at the heart of Google's and Facebook's business models. In \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" published earlier this year, Shoshana Zuboff, an emerita professor at Harvard Business School, warns of a \"rogue mutation of capitalism,\" in which tech behemoths surveil humans, and eventually control them. McNamee speaks often about surveillance capitalism, and credits Zuboff with informing his views and with bringing academic clout to the cause of Silicon Valley reformists. Like Zuboff, he uses phrases such as \"behavioral modification,\" and he speaks of Google Street View and the Stasi in the same breath. McNamee was alarmed by reports, in early November, of Google's partnership with Ascension, a nonprofit health system that has access to millions of patient profiles-a development that, he said, \"should trouble everybody.\"</p><p>It's notable that the dust jacket of McNamee's book attacking Facebook includes blurbs from three of the Valley's biggest names: Marc Benioff (a co-C.E.O. of Salesforce), Bill Joy (a co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and Vint Cerf (currently Google's \"chief Internet evangelist,\" who is often referred to as the \"father of the Internet\"). Rivalries in Silicon Valley once revolved around technological prowess, consumer allegiance, and profitability. Now competition is for moral superiority, a fight that McNamee has found himself in the middle of.</p><p>McNamee sees his defection from Silicon Valley as nothing more than a return to his roots-an identity that mixes camp and sincerity. When I asked him to say more about his value system, he referred me to \"Get Together,\" a nineteen-sixties Youngbloods anthem. (\"Come on people, now\u00a0/\u00a0smile on your brother\u00a0/\u00a0Everybody get together,\u00a0/\u00a0try to love one another right now.\") McNamee's father, Daniel, was an investment banker and the president of the Albany chapter of the Urban League, a civil-rights organization. His mother, Barbara, was an active feminist in the sixties. At the age of twelve, McNamee became an anti-Vietnam War activist, volunteering for Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign; in high school, he backed George McGovern. In protest of the Iraq War and other policies during the George\u00a0W. Bush Administration, he refused to cut his hair. When President Obama was inaugurated, he celebrated with a trip to the barber.</p><p>Travelling around the country, McNamee carries a guitar case and a knapsack embroidered with the word \"Zucked.\" (He handed out custom-made \"Zucked\" M&amp;M's during his tour until they ran out.) He used to pack as many as seven devices while on the road; now he carries just one iPhone, clipped to his belt. On his left wrist, he wears several leather bracelets: one for Black Lives Matter, another commemorating the March for Our Lives. On most days, he dons a purple undershirt-\"the color of inclusion,\" he told me.</p><p>Silicon Valley companies have always talked about building a better world. In \"From Counterculture to Cyberculture\" (2006), Fred Turner, a professor of communications at Stanford, charted the history of \"collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley.\" McNamee hopes that this utopian fusion of culture and technology can be harnessed again, this time for reform.</p><p>After the Truth About Tech conference ended, McNamee gave a happy-hour presentation to employees of a Baltimore-based investment-management firm. \"Give up your Android phone,\" he told an audience of around a hundred fund managers wearing business casual and drinking craft beer. \"This is our agency. This is our free will.\" He joked, \"When do you check your phone in the morning? Is it before you pee or while you're peeing? Because that's pretty much the range!\"</p><p>McNamee offers himself as a case study in how to be Google-free. He uses DuckDuckGo, a search engine that presents itself as a privacy-oriented alternative to Google, and he has largely renounced Gmail, Maps, Docs, and the company's other apps. In two months, he slipped up only once, when he watched a music video on YouTube, which Google owns. He argues that Facebook should be used for staying in touch with friends and family, rather than for political debates, which the platform alchemizes into screaming matches. \"Outrage and fear are what drive their business model, so don't engage with it,\" he told me. \"I was as addicted as anybody, but we have the power to withdraw our attention.\"</p><p>His life is made easier by the fact that he has relatively few complaints about Apple, which he praises for taking steps to protect user privacy. Since 2017, the company's Safari browser has blocked third-party cookies, one ubiquitous tool for gleaning personal data. And its new Apple Card, unlike many other credit cards, including American Express and Mastercard, does not share transaction history with third parties.</p><p>But some audience members were skeptical. A woman raised her hand. \"Are you still on Facebook?\" she asked. McNamee barely let her finish. \"It's worse than that!\" he said. He uses his profile to promote his book, and has only recently begun to off-load his Facebook stock. It wouldn't have been a good look, he explained, to sell and then start bad-mouthing the company: \"If the stock goes down, you know what? I deserve it!\"</p><p>At the core of McNamee's concerns is Internet companies' use of what he calls \"data voodoo dolls\"-digital profiles they develop for each user. Echoing Shoshana Zuboff's arguments, he claims that these profiles are \"effectively an extension of yourself,\" and that it should be \"no more legitimate to trade the data in a data voodoo doll than it is to trade someone's kidney.\" McNamee is especially fervent about micro-targeted online political ads. For those critics who preach the perils of social media-whether from academia, like Zuboff, or Capitol Hill, like Adam Schiff-the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal is the quintessential example of how people can be turned into puppets. By collecting data from Facebook without user consent, the company was able to identify micro-populations of voters, then serve up customized ads encouraging them to vote for Donald Trump. Cambridge Analytica obtained user data through duplicitous means, but similar data sets are widely and legally available; micro-targeting is commonplace on nearly all political campaigns.</p><p>The question, as McNamee sees it, is how to wrest back control for the people behind the profiles. One of the most popular answers is that antitrust law should be used to take on Big Tech's power. Elizabeth Warren, who has met with McNamee and called him \"one of the clearest voices\" on tech reform, has made the breakup of tech giants a central part of her campaign. Bernie Sanders has pledged to press the antitrust issue if elected; Joe Biden has said that he will investigate it. In March, McNamee was invited to give a lecture at the Department of Justice's antitrust division. In the following months, the D.O.J. and the F.T.C., along with various state legislatures and congressional committees, announced antitrust investigations aimed at Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.</p><p>There is some bipartisan support for tech reform. The Republican senators Marco Rubio (who sponsored a bill authorizing the F.T.C. to devise data-privacy regulations) and Josh Hawley (who co-sponsored a bill with Senator Markey to improve online privacy protections for children) are among the most outspoken advocates. But Adam Schiff, now the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, speaking about his colleagues across the aisle, told me, \"I think their agenda is to change what they think is unfavorable content.\" In particular, he suspects that Republicans may be trying to crack down on the supposed \"pro-progressive\" bias of social-media companies. (There is no evidence that such bias exists.)</p><p>Several data-privacy bills circulating in Congress draw inspiration from California's Consumer Privacy Act, which goes into effect on January 1st, and from Europe's recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation. Such laws expand consumers' control over their data and give them new legal tools for holding companies accountable. Many privacy advocates, including McNamee, argue that they are critically flawed. Under G.D.P.R. rules, companies must ask users to opt in before their data can be processed by third parties-but, as soon as consumers consent, it's more or less back to business as usual. And the rules are relatively loose when it comes to metadata. Even if the contents of a phone call are protected, the time of the call or the parties involved might not be. This is more revealing than it seems: as a memo by the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, a tech giant that doesn't know your name might still \"know you called a gynecologist, spoke for a half hour, and then called the local abortion clinic's number later that day.\"</p><p>McNamee believes that antitrust action will be effective only after comprehensive privacy reforms are enacted-otherwise, it will simply create smaller companies that behave in the same ways that the big ones do now. \"I want to prevent the data from getting into the system in the first place,\" he told me. The reform that would really have teeth, he says, is one that would \"ban all third-party commerce in private information-financial information, location information, health information, browser history, scanning of e-mail.\" Companies would be allowed to collect data needed for their services, but nothing else: a wellness app could store your height or your weight but not the location of your gym-and none of this information could be shared with Facebook. The idea, McNamee explained, is that you could log a workout without then being bombarded by ads for nearby Zumba classes.</p><p>As Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia, has pointed out, few of the current proposed policies would have any effect on whether a company can collect private data, only on how it can be used. Under McNamee's plan, most of Google's and Facebook's revenues would disappear overnight, since nearly ninety per cent of both companies' money comes from ads. (Tech companies that don't depend on targeted-ad revenue would remain relatively unaffected.) As with the effect of prohibition on the booze industry, this would entail a radical re\u00ebnvisioning of the playing field.</p><p>Even some critics of Silicon Valley find this blueprint of tech reform too extreme. Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been advocating for a strict national privacy law for decades, said, \"I'm not opposed to it in principle, but I think that there are a lot of practical problems.\" She notes there would be valid legal defenses against a ban on third-party commerce, along with trade-offs to consider-like limiting advances in A.I., which, for now, relies on vast data sets to train machine-learning programs.</p><p>There are other proposals that might redefine online privacy norms without wholly reinventing them. Tristan Harris, a former Google ethicist and the executive director of the Center for Humane Technology, said that most people \"would never say a doctor or lawyer shouldn't have access to information about us, or that they can't monetize something in their relationship with us. We say they have to monetize it in alignment with our best interests.\" Instead of a ban, Harris argues for extending the fiduciary duty of doctors, lawyers, and other professions to include Internet companies, legally binding them to act exclusively in accordance with their clients' well-being.</p><p>He also proposes a tax on income derived from targeted digital ads, an approach endorsed by the economist and Nobel laureate Paul Romer. In theory, this would encourage tech companies to adopt business models that rely less on personal data, and the tax would be progressive, so as to favor smaller businesses. Harris likens the monetization of user data to the extraction of fossil fuels: \"These are the most profitable business models but also the most polluting.\" Alongside a tax on polluters, he proposes subsidizing alternatives-platforms that have made commitments not to stoke outrage.</p><p>Tech reformists like McNamee are generally focussed on the biggest actors. But Ben Thompson, a former Microsoft and Apple employee who now runs the tech-industry analysis site Stratechery, criticized Apple's new Tracking Prevention Policy (a stricter version of its previous anti-tracking regime), which he sees as a P.R. move that will disproportionately burden smaller companies like his own. Meanwhile, he noted, Apple has failed to disclose its more egregious privacy violations; in July, the Guardian revealed that contractors had listened to some Siri recordings without user consent, as part of quality-control protocol. \"A fundamentalist attitude that declares privacy more important than anything,\" Thompson wrote, is akin to a \"rebellious youth fleeing religion.\"</p><p>As fears about privacy invasions and electoral intrusions mount, tech companies are tempting scapegoats. But the algorithms they use may not be as powerful as we think. Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, a tech columnist and former product manager at Facebook, argues that the media has exaggerated the impact of targeted political ads. Before Cambridge Analytica, he told me, every tech journalist \"had to write the Facebook privacy piece, like, once a year at least. Now it's one a week.\" A recent study of targeted advertising, published in Marketing Science, analyzed fourteen data brokers and found that they correctly surmised the gender of targeted consumers only forty-two per cent of the time; they would have been better off flipping a coin. Another group of researchers concluded that targeted ads net only four per cent more revenue than random ads do. Contrary to conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley, companies don't need to target consumers to make money. (This is the premise of DuckDuckGo, which serves up ads based on keyword searches, rather than on user profiles.) It also implies that McNamee's dire warnings about behavioral manipulation may not be entirely sound. McNamee's oft-repeated claim is that surveillance capitalism undermines democracy by manipulating users' habits and choices, but his rhetoric effectively cedes agency to tech companies: we're helpless unless Silicon Valley agrees to change its ways.</p><p>On a Monday morning in April, McNamee arrived in Toronto for a brief Canadian stop on the \"Zucked\" tour. I joined him for breakfast with Jim Balsillie, a billionaire philanthropist and the retired co-C.E.O. of the Canadian company behind BlackBerry, who has recently joined the tech-reform movement. In part because of BlackBerry, Toronto is sometimes described as Silicon Valley North.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, Balsillie and McNamee met with other tech experts at the Hamptons estate of George Soros, to discuss the fate of the liberal world order. They had both advised Soros on the speech he gave, earlier that year, at the World Economic Forum, in which he called Facebook and Google a \"menace,\" painting a picture of \"a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined.\"</p><p>Recently, Balsillie and McNamee split with Soros on a key point. Soros fears that weakening Western tech companies would allow authoritarian regimes like the Chinese government, which actively exports its surveillance systems, to leapfrog the rest of the world. For those in Soros's camp, using surveillance to crack down on dissent-as the Chinese government does among Uighur Muslims-is a graver concern than using data collection to determine whom to sell microwaves to. McNamee wonders if Soros's perspective would be different if he'd worked in tech. \"George thinks the enemy is China,\" Balsillie said. \"We've seen the enemy, and the enemy is us.\"</p><p>One of Balsillie's primary targets is Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's parent company), which has proposed building a community \"from the Internet up\" on Toronto's waterfront. Conceptual plans for the project include \"building raincoats\" that spring out like giant canopies over urban plazas, and a tunnel system for trash collection by robots. But the backbone of the twelve-acre development is a network of sensors and other data-collection infrastructure. According to a leaked internal Sidewalk Labs document, \"the majority of the negative press coverage is rooted in an anti-global tech giant narrative being spun by\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Jim Balsillie.\"</p><p>In this shifting terrain, tech companies are jockeying for position, which often entails striking out at competitors. Oracle's alarming-or, to some, alarmist-messaging about Android's data collection is just one example. Microsoft often portrays itself as the wise elder among younger competitors. The company has already been through antitrust proceedings, and, because it doesn't depend on targeted-ad revenue, it is relatively unthreatened by limits on data collection. At an event in September, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said, \"I think the first aspect of democratizing data is recognizing that it belongs to individuals.\" In January, Twitter users stumbled on Microsoft's Project Bali, a beta-stage initiative to create a \"data bank\" that would allow users \"to visualize, manage, control, share and monetize\" their data. (The Project Bali Web site has since been removed.)</p><p>McNamee hopes to exploit companies' rivalries for the public interest. Silicon Valley, he argues, is in \"the trust business-if you lose the trust of the people who use the product, you are done. You never get it back.\" And, though he insists that his own career as an investor is over, he believes that regulatory intervention paired with consumer demand could help create \"the next big thing\"-an opening not only for the ethically minded but also for the profit-seeking.</p><p>Apple may be best situated to seize this opportunity. In the talks and meetings I attended, McNamee touted Apple's pro-privacy stance nearly as often as he dramatized Google's trespasses, exhorting his audiences to use Apple products. The amiable breakfast with Jim Balsillie turned briefly awkward when McNamee insisted that Balsillie stop using his BlackBerry, which runs on Android, and buy an iPhone. \"You need to get off it,\" McNamee snapped. \"Like, today.\"</p><p>I asked McNamee whether anyone had ever accused him of being a shill for Apple. \"These are facts! A shill is somebody who spins things that aren't there,\" he said. \"Not everything at Apple is perfect. But on the privacy thing Tim Cook is really walking the walk.\" As is the case with Microsoft, Apple's business model doesn't rely heavily on monetizing data, which makes it easier for the company to promote itself as privacy-friendly. In January, outside the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a billboard announced \"What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone\"; in July, an Apple ad above the Sidewalk Labs headquarters in Toronto read \"We're in the business of staying out of yours.\"</p><p>And yet there's no question that, by putting computers in our pockets, Apple ushered in the surveillance age. Researchers have found that iPhones send a steady stream of personal data to third parties, much as Android phones do. The company is also a pioneer in Bluetooth beacons, tiny devices used by retailers which glean data from phones as people move about in public spaces. Apple's use of Chinese subcontractors has led to speculation that the company's products are at risk of being compromised by the Chinese government-a prospect that flies in the face of Apple's reputation for being virtually unhackable. In August, Google researchers exposed a large-scale iPhone breach that, according to anonymous sources who spoke with the Web site Tech Crunch, was initiated by the Chinese government in order to surveil Uighurs. Google's blog post about the incident, which failed to mention that Android phones had also been affected, described \"mass exploitation\" of iPhones. In a tersely worded response, Apple criticized Google for \"stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised. This was never the case.\"</p><p>The tech-reform movement can be hard to take seriously when some of the most prominent activists are also some of the most prominent tech-company shareholders. McNamee's insistence that Facebook and Google engage in \"malicious behavioral modification\" runs the risk of sounding like conspiracy-speak. And his proposed ban on third-party data commerce could result in excessive pressure applied in the wrong place.</p><p>While we waited for our food to arrive, I asked McNamee and Balsillie whether they were the best candidates for bringing about meaningful change in Silicon Valley. \"Excuse me?\" McNamee said, spreading his arms and leaning toward me across the table. \"Who better to criticize than the people who participated in it?\" He went on, \"My attitude is: have at it, dude. When a better messenger shows up, I'm going to be in the front of the line cheering them on.\"</p><p>Balsillie told me that Silicon Valley stalwarts often discount Shoshana Zuboff and other scholars as \"academic eggheads\": \"When someone like Roger or me says, 'Here's how we share this issue,' it allows those people to be better heard. They can say, 'We're not raging socialists, because, look, there's a capitalist over there.'\u00a0\" Zuboff, who was one of Balsillie's professors at Harvard, seems to welcome the defectors. \"Folks like Roger and Jim now see the elephant,\" she said in an e-mail. \"It's important to see former tech insiders adding their stories to this tectonic shift. We need more of them.\"</p><p>Later that day, McNamee was scheduled to give a lunchtime presentation at the Four Seasons in Toronto's Yorkville district. For ninety-five dollars each, four hundred attendees received a copy of McNamee's book and a salmon lunch served by white-gloved waiters. I struck up a conversation with a banking C.E.O. who had recently deleted Facebook for ethical reasons, and because she recognized her addiction. \"I didn't like the fact that I was looking at it every day,\" she explained.</p><p>McNamee peppered his speech with his usual jokes; a riff on \"Google Glass-holes\" that I'd heard before got a big laugh. A few minutes into his presentation, he turned to Sidewalk Labs. His opposition to the smart city, he told the audience, was based on \"a very, very, very, very strong belief\" about the risks of Alphabet's venture.</p><p>\"They want to be a government, but without any of the responsibilities of government,\" he said. McNamee explained that the ultimate goal of surveillance capitalists is to eliminate uncertainty in decision-making: \"That has a superficial appeal, until you realize that agency and identity depend on uncertainty, because it is the choices we make in uncertainty that define who we are.\" There were a few murmurs of approval.</p><p>During the question-and-answer period, a silver-haired woman approached the microphone to say that McNamee's worries sounded like science fiction. She admitted that she didn't own a cell phone, then said, \"I saw the privacy issue, but I wasn't smart enough to invest and make a profit from it.\" The room filled with nervous laughter. McNamee smiled. A middle-aged woman who identified herself \"as someone who runs an accelerator\" wondered how she could instill in young entrepreneurs a sense of \"balanced capitalism.\" McNamee nodded eagerly while she spoke.</p><p>\"We used to let gas stations pour oil down the sewer, and we let mines leave tailings on the side of the hill,\" he said. \"Then we realized, Wait a minute, the externalities have a very high cost, and the people who create them need to bear it.\" The same crisis had been allowed to take hold in Silicon Valley. Don't fall for the allure of smart this and smart that, McNamee said. He repeated one of his common refrains: \"The fix for this is going to be a business opportunity way bigger than what we have now. The difference is that if we do this right it's spread over thousands and thousands of companies in hundreds of cities.\"</p><p>McNamee paused and glanced around with a beatific expression. \"That's why this whole road show is so much fun for me,\" he said. Above all, he told the room, he wanted to find \"people who can be part of the solution.\" He was in his element; the crowd waited for him to continue. When the speech was over, McNamee stepped back from the podium, already moving on to the next show.\u00a0\u2666</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1219_21</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPD-9CG1-DYWH-9017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

Yet he seemed flummoxed when asked why, in 2016, Google merged the vast databases of personal information gathered by both companies, despite a commitment to the European Parliament in 2008 that it would not. When pushed, Pichai eventually acknowledged that he must have approved the decision himself.</p><p>Similarly, Zuckerberg was vague on critical detail around the company's acquisition of Instagram, a purchase that, alongside its ownership of WhatsApp, has given it a formidable position across social media. Pressed repeatedly by Rep Gerry Nadler as to whether the purchase aimed to neutralise a major competitor - one US measure of a monopoly - Zuckerberg turned evasive. </p><p>Bezos came under close fire on Amazon's business practices, especially from Rep Pramila Jayapal, who questioned whether the company squelched competitors, including small family retailers, on its market platform. Cook, the most able performer under pressure, nonetheless struggled when asked about Apple's App Store policies and evidence that it had constrained or removed competing apps.</p><p>After five hours, the opening attempts by the four to present their companies as nice (albeit big) guys - just data and privacy-respecting competitors in busy market sectors that offered consumers many alternative choices - rang hollow.</p><p>Only a day later, the four firms reported top earnings in the midst of a pandemic and economic crisis that has eviscerated many other notable companies. With a combined value of $5 trillion, the four giants all exceeded analysts' earnings estimates, and increased their market cap by a combined $250 billion. Awkward timing, given Rep Cicilline's closing comments. \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\" he stated. \"Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4320373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H3-8SW1-JC8Y-80N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Running in a race stacked against her, the Hawaii congresswoman is a singular figure who doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any one ideology, not even within her own party. She\u2019s firmly anti-war in all of its forms (including the war on drugs), suspicious of big tech, skeptical of Russia-gate, and as of this week, open to regulating abortion. </p><p>In an interview with Dave Rubin, Gabbard agreed that abortion should not be legal during the third trimester unless a medical emergency necessitated it. Though she tends to think of abortion as a \u201clibertarian\u201d would, she disagrees with the Democratic Party\u2019s mantra that there should be open, easy access to abortions any time and any place. </p><p>\u201cI think that there should be some restrictions,\u201d she said. When asked what her \u201ccutoff point\u201d would be, Gabbard replied, \u201cI think the third trimester. Unless a woman\u2019s life or severe health consequences is at risk, then there shouldn\u2019t be an abortion in the third trimester.\u201d </p><p>Gabbard\u2019s position isn\u2019t unusual or unpopular. In fact, 79% of Americans, regardless of whether they identify as pro-choice or pro-life, oppose late-term abortion. Among pro-choice adults, 66% oppose third-trimester abortions, according to a survey conducted by YouGov. </p><p>Most infants born in the third trimester, known as preemies, can survive with medical attention, thanks to modern medicine. And infants still in the womb during the last three months of pregnancy begin to open their eyes, practice breathing for the first time, and detect light. This is life, and it is beautiful. </p><p>Unfortunately, Gabbard seems to be one of the only Democratic presidential candidates willing to not just recognize the humanity of unborn infants, but also to do something about it. Other candidates, such as Beto O\u2019Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have argued women should be given the option of abortion right up until birth, while some in the Democratic Party, such as Virginia Gov.

Embarking on what he called a \"listening tour,\" Zuckerberg wanted to make personal connections with Americans across the country and talk to them about \"how they're living, working and thinking about the future.\" There to document his travels was a former White House photographer who captured a series of pictures portraying the billionaire tech mogul as a man of the people: he ate dinner with a family in Ohio, fed a calf on a farm in Wisconsin, and worked the assembly line of a Ford Motor Company plant in Michigan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In August, when Zuckerberg hired a top Democratic pollster who had previously advised Barack Obama and served as a chief strategist for Hillary Clinton, the rumor mill picked up steam. The Washington Post published an article the next day with the headline, \"Even Mark Zuckerberg Can't Stop the Meme That He is Running for President.\"</p><p>Today, less than two years later, a Zuckerberg campaign seems improbable. The drip, drip, drip of scandal facing the social media company has left the Facebook founder and CEO beaten and bruised in the court of public opinion. With his critics manning the barricades, he has been forced to retreat.</p><p>Zuckerberg's diminishing electoral viability is instructive, for it serves as a microcosm of the Democratic Party's tumultuous relationship with Silicon Valley over the past three years. Indeed, the tech companies, once embraced as agents capable of ushering in a new era of technocratic governance, have increasingly drawn the ire of prominent Democrats-especially those seeking the party's nomination in 2020.</p><p>The 2016 presidential election was the watershed moment that elevated the specter of the tech giants in the nation's collective consciousness. Russian troll farms operating under the directive of the Kremlin infiltrated America's information ecosystem with a nefarious campaign of fake news, micro-targeted advertisements, and viral memes in an attempt to influence the outcome. The ubiquitous tech giants, unable to adequately police their own platforms, were unwitting accomplices.</p><p>Although sour grapes over their election loss can partially explain the animosity, the full-blown \"techlash\" which has taken root within the Democratic Party in the intervening years is not merely the result of rank partisanship. The dominant players-Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google-have been roiled by controversies. These include privacy scandals and data breaches, the discovery of offshore tax havens, weapons development projects with geopolitical rivals, undisclosed planned obsolescence for hardware, poor labor practices in overseas factories and domestic warehouses, and ham-fisted efforts to moderate \"hate speech\" that have enraged the Left and Right alike.</p><p>The tech industry has long benefited from laws that have given its major firms broad immunity and a long leash. The goal of this handsoff approach was to foster and encourage innovation. However, the aforementioned series of events has led to a growing awareness- in the media, on Capitol Hill, and amongst the general public-of just how powerful these firms have become, and how unaccountable they are.</p><p>The days of what some have equated to the \"Wild West\" are quickly coming to an end. And the debate within the Democratic Party, especially as the 2020 campaign heats up, is not if there should be regulation of tech firms, but how they should be regulated.</p><p>Concerns over how much information the tech giants collect on their users, and how reliable they are in protecting user data, have led some lawmakers to view consumer privacy laws as a fruitful avenue of regulation. To this effect, Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat representing the home district for the headquarters of Facebook and Google, released an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" in October.</p><p>Drafted at the behest of thenincoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the statement of principles has received the endorsement of Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, and is viewed by House Democrats as a foundation for future legislative efforts. It calls for greater transparency in data collection practices by websites, opt-in consent for data collection, network neutrality, the ability to transfer personal data from one network to the next, and timely notification if a company holding personal data suffers a hack.</p><p>\"The problem is not just with Zuckerberg,\" Khanna told Recode, an online tech publication, last fall. \"I mean, I hold him accountable, but since when did we think in this country that 30-somethingyear-old entrepreneurs should be writing the rules for internet privacy? That's the responsibility of Congress. And what was shocking to me is members of Congress asking Zuckerberg, \"Well, what should we do?\"</p><p>Beefed up consumer privacy laws are the regulation of choice for some 2020 hopefuls like Senator Kamala Harris. Senator Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, is unconvinced that privacy laws alone will tame the power wielded by the tech giants. In her analysis, the problem runs much deeper, and is, fundamentally, a question of market power. To address these concerns, the Massachusetts Democrat released a policy proposal in March claiming that her administration, were she were to win the presidency, would break up the industry giants.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power-too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,\" Warren wrote. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>Warren notes that nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon, and that more than 70 percent of internet traffic goes through websites and apps that Facebook or Google own or operate. According to Warren, these companies use this dominant market position to employ a host of anti-competitive practices that stifle smaller firms.</p><p>Warren argues that one of the reasons the dominant tech companies became so powerful was lax antitrust regulators who approved anticompetitive mergers. Drawing on a \"long tradition of breaking up companies when they have become too big and dominant,\" she said that she would appoint enforcers who would break up mergers that should not have been approved. Her proposal specifically identifies Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Google's acquisition of the ad company DoubleClick and traffic app Waze, and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods as possible mergers her administration would unwind.</p><p>Additionally, her administration would introduce legislation to force all tech platforms to treat their users equally and not engage in price discrimination. This requirement, according to Warren, is essential to eliminating the current business incentives that are driving corporations to engage in ever more massive data extraction and invasions of privacy. The law would also designate larger platforms with annual revenues of $25 billion or more as \"platform utilities\" and forbid them from both owning and participating in the platform as well as sharing user data with third parties.</p><p>The scope of the problem, in her estimation, is not limited to the tech giants. Just three weeks after releasing her proposal to break up big tech, she released another collection of proposals that included similar structural remedies aimed at the multinational agribusinesses dominating American agriculture.</p><p>None of the 2020 candidates have fully endorsed Warren's proposals but many of the candidates, including Senators Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Cory Booker, are embracing variations of antitrust reform to combat corporate concentration. They view antitrust as one tool that both takes account of voters' economic frustrations and provides a blueprint for reversing the concentration of wealth, the growing gap between the rich and poor, the collapse of the middle class, and the erosion of the democratic process.</p><p>Although the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is flexing its populist muscles in its effort to tame corporate power, there are some obvious political roadblocks to the structural remedies that Warren is seeking. For starters, the employees of tech companies are reliably progressive on social issues, and have put their money where their values are. More than 95 percent of campaign contributions given by tech employees in 2016 went into the coffers of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been known to be a Facebook ally on Capitol Hill, and Barack Obama, arguably the most popular living Democrat, had notoriously cozy ties with Google executives while president. Google representatives attended hundreds of White House meetings during Obama's eight years in office, at a rate of more than once a week.</p><p>However, the very factors that serve as roadblocks for progressive populists within their own party might be the same ones that open the door to an unlikely alliance.</p><p>That a progressive Democrat like Warren wants to lean on the federal government to combat entrenched megacorporations is unsurprising. Perhaps more surprising is how much purchase Warren's critique of the tech giants has garnered from her colleagues on the other side of the aisle.</p><p>When Warren released her proposal to break up the tech giants in March, Facebook promptly prevented her from purchasing advertisements on its platform. Senator Ted Cruz signaled support for Warren: \"First time I've ever retweeted Elizabeth Warren. But she's right- Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech. They shouldn't be censoring Warren, or anybody else. A serious threat to our democracy.\"</p><p>For their part, conservatives have long claimed that Google's search results are biased against their values. They have complained about arbitrary \"deplatforming\" from major social media sites, resulting in reduced audience engagement and lost revenues. The controversial firing of Google employee James Damore in 2017, after he disseminated a memo that broke from cultural liberal orthodoxy, functioned as a catalyst for even more scrutiny from the Right.</p><p>A Morning Consult/Politico poll published in March showed that a plurality of registered Republican voters believe that big tech has \"too much power.\" This has led more conservatives both on Capitol Hill and in the media to train their crosshairs on these platforms, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has consistently criticized the tech giants for the past two years.</p><p>President Donald Trump has sharp political instincts and a keen understanding of his base, whatever one thinks of his governing prowess. And yet, for all his big-techis-bad bluster, and his numerous tweets chastising the tech firms and their CEOs, his administration has done little to combat the evergrowing economic and political power wielded by these companies. Some have argued that the Trump administration, under the guidance of Makan Delrahim, the head of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, has made them even stronger.</p><p>Freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has quickly emerged as the most outspoken critic of big tech in the Republican Party. Appointed to the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee in February, Hawley has helped lead investigations into Facebook, and urged committee chairman Senator Lindsey Graham to take up more tech issues.</p><p>In his prior role as attorney general of Missouri, Hawley had investigated Google to determine whether the company had violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws.</p><p>\"You have to think about privacy. You have to think about competition. You have to think about speech bias,\" Hawley told The Verge in March. \"I mean, these companies are so huge and their influence is so massive that any action impacts huge parts of society and law.\" ?</p><p>Daniel Kishi is associate editor of The American Conservative.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMCONS-2210885827</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMCONSMay 2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPF-3MX1-JBHT-D442-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2005\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright May 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright May 2019 American Conservative LLC May/Jun 2019</copyright><publicationName>American Conservative</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1540966X</issn><volume>Vol. 18</volume><issueNumber>No. 3</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Embarking on what he called a \"listening tour,\" Zuckerberg wanted to make personal connections with Americans across the country and talk to them about \"how they're living, working and thinking about the future.\" There to document his travels was a former White House photographer who captured a series of pictures portraying the billionaire tech mogul as a man of the people: he ate dinner with a family in Ohio, fed a calf on a farm in Wisconsin, and worked the assembly line of a Ford Motor Company plant in Michigan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In August, when Zuckerberg hired a top Democratic pollster who had previously advised Barack Obama and served as a chief strategist for Hillary Clinton, the rumor mill picked up steam. The Washington Post published an article the next day with the headline, \"Even Mark Zuckerberg Can't Stop the Meme That He is Running for President.\"</p><p>Today, less than two years later, a Zuckerberg campaign seems improbable. The drip, drip, drip of scandal facing the social media company has left the Face-book founder and CEO beaten and bruised in the court of public opinion. With his critics manning the barricades, he has been forced to retreat.</p><p>Zuckerberg's diminishing electoral viability is instructive, for it serves as a microcosm of the Democratic Party's tumultuous relationship with Silicon Valley over the past three years. Indeed, the tech companies, once embraced as agents capable of ushering in a new era of technocratic governance, have increasingly drawn the ire of prominent Democrats--especially those seeking the party's nomination in 2020.</p><p>The 2016 presidential election was the watershed moment that elevated the specter of the tech giants in the nation's collective consciousness. Russian troll farms operating under the directive of the Kremlin infiltrated America's information ecosystem with a nefarious campaign of fake news, micro-targeted advertisements, and viral memes in an attempt to influence the outcome. The ubiquitous tech giants, unable to adequately police their own platforms, were unwitting accomplices.</p><p>Although sour grapes over their election loss can partially explain the animosity, the full-blown \"techlash\" which has taken root within the Democratic Party in the intervening years is not merely the result of rank partisanship. The dominant players--Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google--have been roiled by controversies. These include privacy scandals and data breaches, the discovery of offshore tax havens, weapons development projects with geopolitical rivals, undisclosed planned obsolescence for hardware, poor labor practices in overseas factories and domestic warehouses, and ham-fisted efforts to moderate \"hate speech\" that have enraged the Left and Right alike.</p><p>The tech industry has long benefited from laws that have given its major firms broad immunity and a long leash. The goal of this hands-off approach was to foster and encourage innovation. However, the aforementioned series of events has led to a growing awareness--in the media, on Capitol Hill, and amongst the general public--of just how powerful these firms have become, and how unaccountable they are.</p><p>The days of what some have equated to the \"Wild West\" are quickly coming to an end. And the debate within the Democratic Party, especially as the 2020 campaign heats up, is not if there should be regulation of tech firms, but how they should be regulated.</p><p>Concerns over how much information the tech giants collect on their users, and how reliable they are in protecting user data, have led some lawmakers to view consumer privacy laws as a fruitful avenue of regulation. To this effect, Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat representing the home district for the headquarters of Facebook and Google, released an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" in October.</p><p>Drafted at the behest of then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the statement of principles has received the endorsement of Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, and is viewed by House Democrats as a foundation for future legislative efforts. It calls for greater transparency in data collection practices by websites, opt-in consent for data collection, network neutrality, the ability to transfer personal data from one network to the next, and timely notification if a company holding personal data suffers a hack.</p><p>\"The problem is not just with Zuckerberg,\" Khanna told Recode, an online tech publication, last fall. \"I mean, I hold him accountable, but since when did we think in this country that 30-something-year-old entrepreneurs should be writing the rules for internet privacy? That's the responsibility of Congress. And what was shocking to me is members of Congress asking Zuckerberg, \"Well, what should we do?\"</p><p>Beefed up consumer privacy laws are the regulation of choice for some 2020 hopefuls like Senator Kamala Harris. Senator Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, is unconvinced that privacy laws alone will tame the power wielded by the tech giants. In her analysis, the problem runs much deeper, and is, fundamentally, a question of market power. To address these concerns, the Massachusetts Democrat released a policy proposal in March claiming that her administration, were she were to win the presidency, would break up the industry giants.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power--too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,\" Warren wrote. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>Warren notes that nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon, and that more than 70 percent of internet traffic goes through websites and apps that Facebook or Google own or operate. According to Warren, these companies use this dominant market position to employ a host of anti-competitive practices that stifle smaller firms.</p><p>Warren argues that one of the reasons the dominant tech companies became so powerful was lax antitrust regulators who approved anticompetitive mergers. Drawing on a \"long tradition of breaking up companies when they have become too big and dominant,\" she said that she would appoint enforcers who would break up mergers that should not have been approved. Her proposal specifically identifies Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Google's acquisition of the ad company DoubleClick and traffic app Waze, and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods as possible mergers her administration would unwind.</p><p>Additionally, her administration would introduce legislation to force all tech platforms to treat their users equally and not engage in price discrimination. This requirement, according to Warren, is essential to eliminating the current business incentives that are driving corporations to engage in ever more massive data extraction and invasions of privacy. The law would also designate larger platforms with annual revenues of $25 billion or more as \"platform utilities\" and forbid them from both owning and participating in the platform as well as sharing user data with third parties.</p><p>The scope of the problem, in her estimation, is not limited to the tech giants. Just three weeks after releasing her proposal to break up big tech, she released another collection of proposals that included similar structural remedies aimed at the multinational agribusinesses dominating American agriculture.</p><p>None of the 2020 candidates have fully endorsed Warren's proposals but many of the candidates, including Senators Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Cory Booker, are embracing variations of antitrust reform to combat corporate concentration. They view antitrust as one tool that both takes account of voters' economic frustrations and provides a blueprint for reversing the concentration of wealth, the growing gap between the rich and poor, the collapse of the middle class, and the erosion of the democratic process.</p><p>Although the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is flexing its populist muscles in its effort to tame corporate power, there are some obvious political roadblocks to the structural remedies that Warren is seeking. For starters, the employees of tech companies are reliably progressive on social issues, and have put their money where their values are. More than 95 percent of campaign contributions given by tech employees in 2016 went into the coffers of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been known to be a Facebook ally on Capitol Hill, and Barack Obama, arguably the most popular living Democrat, had notoriously cozy ties with Google executives while president. Google representatives attended hundreds of White House meetings during Obama's eight years in office, at a rate of more than once a week.</p><p>However, the very factors that serve as roadblocks for progressive populists within their own party might be the same ones that open the door to an unlikely alliance.</p><p>That a progressive Democrat like Warren wants to lean on the federal government to combat entrenched megacorporations is unsurprising. Perhaps more surprising is how much purchase Warren's critique of the tech giants has garnered from her colleagues on the other side of the aisle.</p><p>When Warren released her proposal to break up the tech giants in March, Facebook promptly prevented her from purchasing advertisements on its platform. Senator Ted Cruz signaled support for Warren: \"First time I've ever retweeted Elizabeth Warren. But she's right--Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech. They shouldn't be censoring Warren, or anybody else. A serious threat to our democracy.\"</p><p>For their part, conservatives have long claimed that Google's search results are biased against their values. They have complained about arbitrary \"deplatforming\" from major social media sites, resulting in reduced audience engagement and lost revenues. The controversial firing of Google employee James Damore in 2017, after he disseminated a memo that broke from cultural liberal orthodoxy, functioned as a catalyst for even more scrutiny from the Right.</p><p>A Morning Consult/Politico poll published in March showed that a plurality of registered Republican voters believe that big tech has \"too much power.\" This has led more conservatives both on Capitol Hill and in the media to train their crosshairs on these platforms, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has consistently criticized the tech giants for the past two years.</p><p>President Donald Trump has sharp political instincts and a keen understanding of his base, whatever one thinks of his governing prowess. And yet, for all his big-tech-is-bad bluster, and his numerous tweets chastising the tech firms and their CEOs, his administration has done little to combat the evergrowing economic and political power wielded by these companies. Some have argued that the Trump administration, under the guidance of Makan Delrahim, the head of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, has made them even stronger.</p><p>Freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has quickly emerged as the most outspoken critic of big tech in the Republican Party. Appointed to the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee in February, Hawley has helped lead investigations into Facebook, and urged committee chairman Senator Lindsey Graham to take up more tech issues.</p><p>In his prior role as attorney general of Missouri, Hawley had investigated Google to determine whether the company had violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws.</p><p>\"You have to think about privacy. You have to think about competition. You have to think about speech bias,\" Hawley told The Verge in March. \"I mean, these companies are so huge and their influence is so massive that any action impacts huge parts of society and law.\"</p><p>by DANIEL KISHI</p><p>Daniel Kishi is associate editor of The American Conservative.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-583654346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 583654346</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1P-3141-JCBJ-K4N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The American Conservative LLC</copyright><publicationName>The American Conservative</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1540-966X</issn><volume>Vol. 18</volume><issueNumber>No. 3</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

HERE'S HOW THAT HAPPENED--AND WHY IT MATTERS.</p><p>On a Monday afternoon in late July, a group of leading Democratic members of Congress, including Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Elizabeth Warren, gathered in small-town Berryville, Virginia, to pitch the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" economic agenda.</p><p>The party's strategy for 2018 had been a topic of obsession since the day after the 2016 election. The Democrats were finally being forced to confront a fundamental weakness: the perception, as the comedian Lewis Black once put it, that while the Republicans are the party of bad ideas, the Democrats are the party of no ideas. Shortly after the election, Schumer had admitted on national television that one reason for Hillary Clinton's loss had been the lack of a \"strong, bold economic message.\" In Berryville, he told the crowd, \"Too many Americans don't know what we stand for. Not after today.\"</p><p>Sort of. The agenda's tedious branding--the subtitle was \"Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future\"--drew mostly derision, not least for its resemblance to the Papa John's motto: \"Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.\" A New Yorker humor piece listed \"rejected slogans,\" including \"Not Perfect, But Also Not Trump.\"</p><p>The problem went beyond the name. If the Better Deal was treated like an overstuffed grab bag of policies designed to placate the entire Democratic caucus, that's because it was one. Much early coverage focused on a proposed tax credit for job training, the exact kind of centrist technocracy so many liberals were afraid of--\"reminiscent of what Bill Clinton was selling in the 1990s,\" as Michelle Cottle put it in the Atlantic.</p><p>The Democrats' problem, then, isn't that no one knows what they stand for on the economy. It's that everyone knows what they stand for: higher taxes, more spending on social welfare, and a stream of opaque, nibble-around-the-edges government programs. Hillary Clinton may as well have said she had binders full of ideas.</p><p>Many commentators did, however, notice one element of the Better Deal that was quite new--and potentially transformative. If you got past the bland subheading \"Lower the costs of living for families,\" you would have found something very different from what anyone was selling in the 1990s: a section on \"Cracking Down on Corporate Monopolies and the Abuse of Economic and Political Power.\"</p><p>This anti-monopoly plank--which Schumer and Pelosi emphasized in op-eds in the New York Times and the Washington Post, respectively--reflected a growing awareness that the economy has become dangerously concentrated. In sector after sector, from retail to beer to eyeglasses, the market is controlled by a small handful of giant companies. And mounting evidence suggests that corporate consolidation is behind some of the economy's deepest problems: income inequality, declining innovation, and the exodus of wealth and jobs from the heartland toward the coasts.</p><p>Donald Trump's ability to tap into these symptoms goes a long way to explaining his decisive Rust Belt appeal. He could channel a sense of decline among white voters there because, unlike Clinton, he told a story about what caused it--free trade, illegal immigration, and corrupt politicians--and how to fix it: quit NAFTA, build a wall, lock her up. That story was mostly false, and it oozed racism and sexism. But Clinton didn't offer an alternative. If Trump was a quack doctor, peddling fake medicine, then Clinton missed the diagnosis.</p><p>That's why including proposals in the Better Deal to address consolidation, however light on details, could end up being a turning point. It marked the party's first unified attempt to grapple with the structural economic barriers holding so many people back. Unlike Trump's racio-economic populism, the story of monopolization isn't a hoax, and it doesn't pit ethnic groups against each other.</p><p>A month after the Better Deal announcement, something happened that gave warnings about corporate consolidation more urgency. New America, a center-left think tank, fired a team of anti-monopoly researchers after the group's director, Barry Lynn, praised European Union sanctions against Google. That was apparently the last straw for Eric Schmidt, a billionaire Google executive and, along with Google itself, one of New America's most generous funders. A chain of emails from New America's president, Anne-Marie Slaughter, strongly suggested that she fired Lynn and his team for angering Schmidt and imperiling the think tank's access to future Google money. (Slaughter publicly denied that suggestion, claiming that Lynn had a pattern of bad behavior.)</p><p>It would have been hard to concoct a better anti-monopoly publicity stunt: a single plutocrat was revealed to have the power to restrict the flow of ideas into public debate. The story of the firing broke on the front page of the New York Times, and two days later Tucker Carlson, of all people, was interviewing one of Lynn's colleagues on Fox News about whether Google is a monopoly. In September, the comedian John Oliver even devoted a long segment of his HBO show to \"corporate consolidation.\" Concern about monopoly was suddenly mainstream.</p><p>This is new. The Reagan administration sharply curtailed antitrust enforcement in the 1980s, and no administration, Democratic or Republican, has tried hard to revive it. Quietly green-lighting enormous mergers has been a rare area of bipartisan consensus for three decades--as Chuck Schumer, the senator of Wall Street, now freely acknowledges. \"How the heck did we let Exxon and Mobil merge?\" Schumer said to George Stephanopoulos while discussing the Better Deal. \"And that was Democrats!\"</p><p>The idea that something's got to be done about monopolies seemed to go from fringe argument to a pillar of the Democrats' economic plan, at least rhetorically, overnight. But it didn't really come out of nowhere. The Better Deal announcement, the New America dust-up--these were the bubblings of a movement that had been brewing for nearly a decade. The story of the Democrats becoming--maybe--the anti-monopoly party, the party of small business, is not just a politics story. It's a story about how ideas win and lose and then, maybe, win again. And it's the story of how a small group of political outsiders got the party establishment to adopt an idea that was essentially left for dead in 1978.</p><p>A challenge in writing a story about monopolies, or antitrust--the body of law concerned with cracking down on monopolization--is that the terms themselves are like a foreign language to most people.</p><p>That wasn't always the case. America used to have a robust tradition of anti-monopoly politics, as you may recall from learning about the \"trust buster\" Teddy Roosevelt in middle school. Farmers were held hostage to discriminatory rates imposed by the railroad monopolies that shipped their crops. Ranchers had to settle for whatever the \"big five\" meatpackers wanted to pay them. Shopkeepers were squeezed by national wholesale chains. (\"Monopoly\" is useful shorthand. Technically, when a handful of companies control a market, rather than just one, it's called an oligopoly.)</p><p>In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, which oudawed attempts to build monopolies or restrict competition. Congress expanded the scope of illegal business activities with the Clayton Act of 1914, the same year it created the Federal Trade Commission, and it tightened the screws once more in 1936. These laws were mostly vague, but, as interpreted by the federal courts, they allowed officials in the Department of Justice and the FTC to block mergers, break up companies that had gotten too big, and make sure markets stayed competitive.</p><p>Throughout those years, it was common for leading politicians to talk about the dangers of monopolization. At the most basic level, the problem with monopolies is that, with no competition, they can charge exorbitant prices. But consolidated economic power poses dangers beyond prices. In the 1912 election, candidate Woodrow Wilson declared, \"If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\" Franklin Roosevelt, in his speech accepting the Democratic renomination for president in 1936, blamed the Great Depression on the \"economic tyranny\" of a monopolized economy.</p><p>Around that time, Roosevelt and his legendary antitrust chief, Ihurman Arnold, kicked off a period of especially aggressive antitrust enforcement that would last into the 1970s. Note that this period saw the country's fastest increases in living standards, the economic halcyon days to which so many people, not least Trump voters, wish we could return. The historian Alfred Chandler Jr. later wrote that Roosevelt's antitrust division \"set the stage\" for the twentieth-century information revolution by forcing companies like IBM to create room for rivals to compete and innovate.</p><p>By the 1960s, it was understood that the federal government would intervene to keep firms from getting too big, period. In the 1961 case Brown Shoe Company v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a merger giving one company control over 2 percent of the nation's shoe outlets violated the Clayton Act. But, perhaps because the movement was so successful, antitrust eventually came to lose its political cachet. It became \"one of the faded passions of American reform,\" wrote the historian Richard Hofstadter in 1964. Historians, he wrote, had come to \"ignore antitrust for the same reason the public ignores it: it has become complex, difficult, and boring.\"</p><p>He might have added \"vulnerable.\"</p><p>Before his last name became synonymous with failed Supreme Court nominations, Robert Bork was a law professor at Yale and a disciple of the so-called Chicago School of economics. The Chicago School movement, most associated with Milton Friedman, argued for laissez-faire economic policy based on the premise of individuals as hyper rational market participants. To the archconservative Bork, antitrust wasn't boring; it was an outrage. Cases like Brown Shoe proved that the Supreme Court had gotten out of control. It was blocking, on touchy-feely grounds, business activity that basic economic models promised would increase efficiency.</p><p>In 1978, Bork published The Antitrust Paradox, which utterly upended the field. The Court's doctrine, Bork argued, was incoherent: it sought both to protect consumers from high prices and to protect small businesses from being squashed. Those goals were at odds with each other--paradoxical--because protecting small businesses from monopolies would allow them to charge higher prices.</p><p>In Bork's entertainingly snarky telling, most politicians, judges, and even economists were just too stupid to see this obvious contradiction. The truth is that antitrust law reflected a decision to balance the protection of small (or at least, non-monopoly) businesses, which leaders going back to Thomas Jefferson saw as vital to democracy and opportunity, with the economic advantages of larger enterprises. But Bork thought there was no way to make those tradeoffs in a principled way.</p><p>And so Bork argued that federal judges must resolve the \"paradox\" by declaring that the only legitimate purpose of antitrust law was to promote \"consumer welfare,\" basically meaning lower prices. And the only way to promote consumer welfare was to promote efficiency, because efficiency meant more production, which meant cheaper products. Any other purpose would interfere with efficiency and must therefore be ignored.</p><p>To see how radical this was, just consider one example of something not captured by consumer welfare: employee welfare. In a town dominated by a single employer, workers may be forced to submit to poverty wages and abusive work conditions. Coal miners know this all too well--so do Walmart employees. (See Alec MacGillis, \"What J. D. Vance Doesn't Get About Appalachia,\" page 49.) But to Bork, that could never justify antitrust enforcement so long as the product stayed cheap.</p><p>The Antitrust Paradox makes for remarkable reading today. Like a caricature of a Chicago School economist, Bork explicitly warned against learning from experience. Rather, all business practices should be judged based on what \"simple\" (his word) economic models predict. \"Only theory can separate the competitive from the anticompetitive,\" he wrote. And theory says consolidation is good, because it means strong firms are crushing weak ones.</p><p>But the most striking thing about Bork's book is how up front he was about seeing the fight over antitrust as part of the culture wars of the 1960s and '70s. The Warren Court, he wrote in the 1993 preface to the second edition, \"wrecked many fields of law in its reckless and primitive egalitarianism. Antitrust was one such field.\" For Bork, an antitrust decision like Brown Shoe was the same kind of leftist judicial activism as Roe v. Wade.</p><p>He presented his method as a technical, value-neutral way to apply the law--a \"science.\" It was a cousin of originalism, another favorite Bork theory, which holds that judges must interpret the Constitution by figuring out the Founding Fathers' true intentions. And, just like originalism, the consumer welfare test pretends to free the law from the grips of ideology when in fact it simply swaps in a different one.</p><p>Antitrust, Bork lamented, had been invaded \"by the ideologies of statism and interventionism,\" and his loathing for economic progressivism was so intense that he repeatedly tipped his hand. For instance, he berated liberal judges for usurping Congress's authority, but also argued that if Congress tells courts to consider factors other than prices, the courts should refuse. That betrayed the phoniness of his professed concern about judicial activism. What was at stake was no less than the fate of capitalism versus socialism.</p><p>When it came to economics, Bork got almost all the important stuff wrong. \"I doubt that there is any significant output restriction arising from the concentration of any industry,\" he wrote, meaning there was nothing wrong with monopolies short of outright price-fixing. After all, if a monopoly raised prices, other competitors would swoop in to undercut it. The market corrects itself.</p><p>But Bork was writing for an audience of nine, and here he was devastatingly effective. Almost as soon as it was published, The Antitrust Paradox became gospel at the Supreme Court. By 1979, one year after the book came out, the Court was already citing its claim--debunked by historians--that \"Congress designed the Sherman Act as a 'consumer welfare prescription.' \" It's not a stretch to say that, within its field, The Antitrust Paradox had the biggest practical impact of any single work of legal scholarship, ever. \"The decisive cause,\" by Bork's own account, \"was a change in the composition of the Supreme Court.\" As the Warren Court's \"liberal ideologues\" died or retired, Richard Nixon had been able to install a conservative and corporate-friendly majority that cottoned instantly to Bork's free-market fantasia.</p><p>The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 meant conservative free-market economics was ascendant no matter what. But Bork provided the intellectual framework to scale back antitrust, and once his ideas caught on among the judiciary, even aggressive-minded enforcers would have a hard time winning cases. Meanwhile, generations of college students who took Econ 101--people who today run the nation's corporations, think tanks, and government agencies--were steeped in the Chicago School dogma that monopoly can't be a problem because the market will always fix it. The laissez-faire approach to mergers and competition ultimately became orthodoxy in both parties. \"Antitrust was defined by Robert Bork,\" the legal scholar Barak Orbach told the Washington Post when Bork died, in 2012. \"I cannot overstate his influence.\"</p><p>Bork reserved special contempt for people who worried about the economy growing too concentrated overall. \"The imminent concentration of all ownership in a few giant corporations, with the concomitant demise of small business, is the standard, Mark I, all-weather antitrust hobgoblin,\" he wrote. \"This congealing of the economy ... never comes to pass.\"</p><p>Well, sure, but only thanks to the legal regime that he was helping to dismantle. After the Reagan administration, following Bork's lead, kicked off the era of lax antitrust enforcement and rampant mergers, the economy would begin a steady climb to levels of concentration not seen since before the original Progressive Era. The most intense wave of mergers has taken place in the years since the 2008 financial crash. According to an analysis by the Economist last year, two-thirds of all corporate sectors grew more concentrated between 1997 and 2012. Today, for example, three chains--Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid--control 99 percent of the nation's pharmacies, and two of them tried to merge last year. Four companies control 85 percent of the beef market. Waves of airline mergers have left four major carriers that account for 80 percent of domestic seats. And so on.</p><p>All this merger activity has led to the exact thing Bork promised wouldn't happen: higher prices. In 2015, the Northeastern University economist John Kwoka published a meta-analysis of every study ever done on mergers in the U.S. since 1985. He found that more than 60 percent of studied mergers led to product price increases, of an average of nearly 9 percent. In some sectors the effects are especially jarring: other research shows that hospitals with no local competition charge 15 percent more for the same care than hospitals with three or more competitors. (See Phillip Longman, \"How Big Medicine Can Ruin Medicare for All,\" page 29.) In short, post-Bork antitrust policy has failed even on its own terms.</p><p>Price increases were only part of the story, however. Median wages stagnated, as more and more economic gains went to the top 1 percent of earners; rates of small business creation declined; and the biggest companies' profits kept growing even as they invested less and less in their businesses. But for years, no one thought to ask whether the rise of a new class of monopolists and the dawn of a new Gilded Age were connected.</p><p>Barry Lynn is an unlikely foil to Robert Bork. A tall fifty-six-year-old Floridian with squinting, skeptical eyes, he is neither a lawyer nor an economist. In 1999 he was the executive editor of a small business magazine when a massive earthquake in Taiwan caused the stock prices of several U.S. tech companies to crash. It turned out that almost all the world's semiconductors were produced there, so that the earthquake, which knocked off power to the region's airports, had momentarily cut off an essential step in the supply chain. That was Lynn's epiphany. At a time of widespread boosterism for the emerging global economy, the quake had revealed the danger of industrial concentration.</p><p>After the business magazine folded, in 2001, Lynn got a fellowship position at New America while he worked on a book about the frailty of the global supply chain, which came out in 2005. In his next book, Cornered, published in 2009, Lynn wrangled with the broader effects of a hyper-concentrated economy. That year, drained from writing two books back to back, he decided he needed a new strategy. Instead of spending years on another book, he would supervise a team of researchers. And instead of pumping out white papers like other think tanks, the team would produce original journalism.</p><p>Robert Bork had inaugurated the second monopoly age by convincing the legal world to ignore facts on the ground. Lynn and his team would take the opposite approach, building a case for rejecting Chicago School competition policy by showing what life really looked like in Bork's America.</p><p>But first they needed an outlet. One was Harper's, which had published a 2006 piece by Lynn arguing to break up Walmart. The other--and here's where this story gets very incestuous--was the magazine you're reading right now. Lynn's work brought him into contact with another New America fellow named Phillip Longman, who happens to be senior editor at the Washington Monthly.</p><p>In early 2010, Paul Glastris, the magazine's editor in chief (so, my boss), was looking for a story about the economy. Longman pitched him a piece that would take on a central riddle of the 2000s: from 1999 to 2009, the economy had added zero new jobs. Even before the real estate bubble burst, growth was 1 historically weak. Explanations like technology and offshoring 1 didn't quite add up.</p><p>Longman and Lynn had a novel theory: the rise in corporate consolidation was the culprit. Small businesses drive most job creation in the U.S. A monopoly, meanwhile, has little reason to hire more workers, because it can just charge higher prices. At the very least, Longman and Lynn concluded, economists and policymakers should start asking whether monopolization was partly to blame for a decade of weak job creation.</p><p>The Monthly had published pieces on concentration in specific industries, including a 2004 cover story by Ted Turner about media consolidation. But Longman and Lynn had figured out something bigger: consolidation across sectors was driving troubling nationwide trends. The article became the first in a series that Lynn and his team would publish in the magazine over the next seven years (including Longman's piece on health care monopolies in this very issue). In 2011, Lynn got funding to set up his Open Markets group at New America. \"The idea was to get as many pieces out there under as many names--up to that point it was mostly just me, and sometimes Phil, writing about these issues,\" he said. \"But there were no other names. So it was like, 'Well, Barry sees another monopoly!'\"</p><p>His first hire was a recent Williams College grad named Lina Khan. Khan became a fixture of the Monthly table of contents in 2012, covering the plight of independent chicken farmers and collaborating with Longman and Lynn on two especially prescient pieces: one on the nasty effects of airline consolidation, which saw renewed interest during the airline scandals of the past year; and one documenting a steep decline in rates of business start-ups since 1980, which was later validated by a Brookings study inspired by the article.</p><p>The pieces hardly went viral, but they left a trail for other researchers to follow. As the smoke cleared from the 2008 recession, economists were trying to make sense of the fact that the share of income going to labor, versus capital, was going down. That could have been due to technological change--but if that were true, you'd expect to see rising investment. That wasn't happening. Other possible theories didn't square with the facts either. Something was pumping up corporate profits at the expense of workers.</p><p>\"This is where the Barry Lynn stuff comes in,\" Paul Krugman, the New York Times columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist, told me. \"Most people who do good economics do stuff partly based on statistics, on measurement, on data. But you always want a story that buys into lived experience. If you tell a story that fits the data but doesn't sound at all like what you see in the world around you, then we're very suspicious of that story.\" The argument about consolidation both described the real world and fit the strange data economists had been observing. It had taken journalists, whose currency is reporting, not theory, to see it.</p><p>In 2012, Krugman wrote approvingly in a column about Lynn and Longman's argument \"that increasing business concentration could be an important factor in stagnating demand for labor, as corporations use their growing monopoly power to raise prices without passing the gains on to their employees.\"</p><p>That shout-out from Krugman, the first of several, was essentially an invitation to other economists to do research to test the hypothesis. Over the next few years, they would begin supplying the numbers to back up Lynn and Longman's observations. But apart from Krugman, the reaction from prominent thinkers and writers was mostly silence. The dominant liberal worldview was still better captured by a 2005 paper written by a then up-and-coming liberal economist named Jason Furman. The title was \"Wal-Mart: A Progressive Success Story,\" and it argued that liberals should celebrate Walmart for providing such cheap goods to poor people.</p><p>Furman would go on to chair Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Under the Obama administration, antitrust policy continued to be permissive--2015 would be the biggest year ever for mergers. Lynn still needed to figure out how to get the attention of the political elite.</p><p>When Lina Khan showed up at the Omni Hotel in New Haven for a welcome party for the Yale Law School class of 2017, she wondered if she'd made a mistake. She had applied to law school because she was convinced that the law needed a new antitrust movement. But journalism still beckoned. As she wandered around the outskirts of the reception, she told the first person she met that she was already thinking about dropping out.</p><p>That person happened to be me. (I told you this story was incestuous.) It was late August 2014, and I was a third-year student helping run the first-year orientation program. I told Khan that journalists were indeed cooler than lawyers, but since she was already at Yale she should probably give it a shot.</p><p>Boy, was that good advice. Yale Law School, where students taking antitrust in room 120 can feel Robert Bork's portrait smirking at the backs of their heads, is one of the most insidery institutions in America--a place where Harvard and Yale college grads outnumber those from all state schools combined, and where students begin gunning for Supreme Court clerkships before they get their first-year course schedule. Bill and Hillary Clinton met there. They had Bork as a professor.</p><p>In other words, while Barry Lynn and the Washington Monthly kept banging away from outside the political establishment, Khan had infiltrated the establishment's finishing school.</p><p>During her first year she met a second-year student named Michael Shapiro, who had worked for the National Economic Council in the Obama White House before coming to Yale. Shapiro, like some of his former colleagues, was aware of the new monopoly critique, having read Krugman's columns. But from Khan he got a steady dose of the most emphatic version of that argument.</p><p>Shapiro was plugged into the small world of Democratic wonks brainstorming economic policy in anticipation of the coming presidential campaign, and he passed along the monopoly stuff that he was discussing with Khan at school. (One of his contacts was an old friend, Jessica Schumer, daughter of Chuck and chief of staff to Jason Furman. Also a Yale Law grad.) When the Clinton campaign launched in spring of 2015, Shapiro joined the economic policy team.</p><p>\"I think he was a key voice on this, early, as a place that we should focus,\" said Jake Sullivan, the campaign's top policy adviser (and yet another Yale Law grad). \"Like, really early. The end of '14, beginning of '15.\" The most tangible result came in October 2015, when Clinton published an op-ed in Quartz promising, if elected, to \"take steps to stop corporate concentration in any industry where it's unfairly limiting competition.\"</p><p>2015 seems to be when the first tendrils of interest in bringing back antitrust started sprouting among liberal cognoscenti. Around the same time as the op-ed, Furman and his former colleague Peter Orszag delivered a paper arguing that economic \"rents\"--profits in excess of what companies should earn in a competitive market--were largely to blame for rising inequality. Furman, you'll recall, is the guy who a decade earlier was urging liberals to embrace Walmart.</p><p>The major liberal think tanks were also getting involved. New America already had Lynn and company. The Roosevelt Institute in May 2015 published a report, coauthored by Joseph Stiglitz, that focused heavily on breaking down industry concentration to foster competition. Most significantly from a political perspective, the Center for American Progress, the policy factory for the Democratic Party founded by John Podesta, would issue a paper in mid-2016 called \"Reviving Antitrust.\"</p><p>Even the Economist, normally a cheerleader for all things free trade and free market, published a March 2016 story picking up the argument that the super-high profits flowing to the top firms suggested a monopoly problem.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the White House, the Council of Economic Advisers was building off the Furman/Orszag paper from 2015. In April 2016 it published a brief adding the administration's weight to the argument that consolidation was up, competition down, and American workers were suffering for it. Obama himself issued an executive order directing all agencies to identify ways to crack down on anticompetitive practices in their areas of jurisdiction.</p><p>But, even with the executive order, this was still basically the realm of white papers, conferences, and issue briefs. It was policy, not politics.</p><p>One Friday morning in March 2016, while I was in town for a story, I met Khan for breakfast at Patricia's, a New Haven diner. Lunch wouldn't work because she had to catch a train to D.C. She was vague about why, but eventually I pulled it out of her: she was having dinner with Elizabeth Warren. Warren's staff occasionally organizes policy-oriented dinners for the senator, and they had reached out to Khan for help planning one focused on antitrust.</p><p>It might seem strange that a senator and former law professor would reach out to a current law student for advice on a legal topic. But there just weren't many options. Khan was one of very few people interested in antitrust who wasn't already an antitrust lawyer trained to look at the world in terms of Borkian efficiency.</p><p>\"Effusing about one's interest in antitrust and monopoly was not very common, or so I'm told,\" Khan said. \"I talked about this stuff at parties.\" Her Yale pedigree didn't hurt, either.</p><p>Warren's office asked Khan to suggest other dinner guests. Naturally, she picked her old boss, Barry Lynn. Lynn had pitched the Democratic primary candidates (even Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb) his argument for an anti-monopoly agenda, but to little effect. Even Bernie Sanders had been lukewarm. Now, Lynn was being invited to present the argument he had been obsessing over for a decade to one of the most powerful Democrats in the Senate.</p><p>Khan and Lynn showed up with a stack of reading material for Warren, mainly their Washington Monthly stories from over the years. Warren was a natural audience. A purveyor of wonky progressive populism, she had made her name in part by inveighing against \"too big to fail\" and the government's response to the financial crisis. She also was vocal about net neutrality, which is rooted in concern over how internet provider monopolies will abuse their power. A few weeks after the dinner, Warren's staff asked Lynn to help organize an event where the senator would give a speech on consolidation and competition.</p><p>The speech Warren gave, in late June 2016, read like a synopsis of the work Lynn and his team had been doing since 2010. \"I love markets!\" she declared. But the markets needed help. The \"too big to fail\" problem, she explained, \"isn't unique to the financial sector. It's hiding in plain sight all across the American economy.\" That, she said, left consumers with fewer choices, made it harder for start-ups to enter markets, devastated local economies, and allowed the biggest players to rig the political system in their favor.</p><p>In Lynn's view, Warren had done no less than carve out a new niche in the party--between the corporate wing, cozy with Wall Street banks and Silicon Valley tech giants, and the Bernie-ite, self-styled socialists. To my boss, Paul Glastris, the speech had \"the potential to change the course of the presidential contest,\" as he wrote in a breathless blog post.</p><p>That was wishful thinking. The mainstream press barely covered the speech. No one cared.</p><p>True, the Democratic platform in July included a section on \"Promoting Competition by Stopping Corporate Concentration.\" According to Herbert Hovenkamp, one of the country's foremost antirust scholars, it was the first platform to make prominent mention of anti-monopoly policy since 1912. But no one besides party activists really pays attention to platforms. Clinton herself, despite the early op-ed in Quartz, barely returned to the topic, other than in one campaign speech a few weeks before the election.</p><p>Several people from the campaign policy team told me they wished they had pushed the competition issue harder. The fact that they did not was one symptom of a by now exhaustively documented failing: despite Bill Clinton's panicked insistence that Hillary needed to develop a stronger economic message to win in places like Michigan, the communications team thought it knew better. The campaign would stick to talking about how vile Donald Trump was.</p><p>\"This was an issue that we never got to give the lift that we wanted,\" said Jake Sullivan, Clintons top policy adviser. A veteran of two disastrous campaigns, Sullivan doesn't hold himself out as a political pundit. But I was curious whether he thought being louder about anti-monopoly policy would have been smart.</p><p>\"I'm not sure how much weight this set of issues can carry politically, but my hunch is, quite a bit,\" he said. \"It tells a story that both allows you to explain why things are going on but also has some hope of being susceptible to solutions.\"</p><p>So why didn't the campaign push it harder? Sullivan acknowledged the obvious--the campaign was light on economic messages in general--but also suggested that his team never quite figured out how to talk about things like consolidation, antitrust policy, and competitive markets in a way that would get through to voters. \"Some aspects of it are difficult to translate,\" he said, like the threat monopolization poses to democracy. \"They are more abstract.\"</p><p>Voters in 2016, unlike in 1936, weren't used to hearing and thinking about the perils of monopoly. A recent piece in the Atlantic by Stacy Mitchell showed that use of the word \"monopoly\" in books peaked in 1949 and has since plummeted to 1880s--pre-Sherman Act--levels. Although Harper's and the Washington Monthly had been raising the issue for years, more prominent elite media like the Economist and the Atlantic didn't catch on until the 2016 primaries were under way. The mainstream press--major newspapers and network TV--still hasn't. It's a lot to ask of a political candidate, in the midst of a campaign, to simultaneously run on an issue and teach voters what it is.</p><p>\"One of the things the Chicago School stole from us is the language,\" said Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and member of Lynn's post-New America group, the Open Markets Institute. \"It sounds technical, but it's actually deeply political, deeply moral. The loss of language was a central loss.\"</p><p>In 2014, Teachout ran a surprisingly strong campaign against Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in New York, winning 34 percent of the vote despite raising less than $1 million. Lina Khan was her policy director. Teachout, who had written a book making a corruption-based argument against Citizens United, had two main policy platforms: public financing for elections, and fighting consolidation. But media coverage of her candidacy focused almost entirely on corruption and campaign finance, which the press was used to, and ignored her anti-monopoly platform, which it wasn't. A feature on Teachout by Jill Lepore in the New Yorker didn't mention monopoly or consolidation once.</p><p>Trump's election forced a traumatized Democratic political class to recognize that it had no coherent vision that addressed the circumstances of the modern American economy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, was especially vocal about the party's need to develop a compelling agenda to have any chance at taking back Congress in 2018, though he gave no indication that he had anything specific in mind. From November through July, his office spearheaded an effort to gather ideas that could both get buy-in from the various factions of the party and appeal on a gut level to the voters the party had lost. It was a post-election Warren Commission, endlessly studying where the bullet had entered the party's brain.</p><p>Schumer and his staff spoke with all forty-seven other Democratic senators, as well as leaders from the House, including Nancy Pelosi and the cochairs of the messaging committee. They also talked with people at the major liberal think tanks and survivors of the Clinton campaign, including Sullivan.</p><p>At many of these stops, what they found was anti-monopoly. Key Clinton and Obama policy people were on board; the top think tanks were pushing it; and Elizabeth Warren, who after Bernie Sanders is the most influential figure within the Democratic left, had gone all in with her speech last summer. A handful of other prominent senators, including Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, were also pushing for antitrust to be part of the agenda.</p><p>Oh, and remember Michael Shapiro, from the campaign? In fall of 2015 he started dating his old friend Jessica Schumer; in 2016 they got married. Jessica had drafted the party platform in Philadelphia that contained a section on breaking up monopolies. It's safe to say that her father was hearing about the topic from many directions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shapiro's old schoolmate Lina Khan had been influencing the conversation from inside the ivory tower. In January, the Yale Law Journal published her 24,ooo-word academic article \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\" The article is a direct attack on the argument Bork advanced in The Antitrust Paradox--namely, that the only thing the law should worry about when it comes to monopoly businesses is their effect on consumer prices and product quality. Khan makes a powerful case that Amazon--even though it delivers quality products at low prices with incredible service--should be seen as a major threat to competition thanks to its dominance of essential internet infrastructure.</p><p>The article has been viewed more than 80,000 times--an astounding number for any piece of legal academic writing and truly remarkable for a student author--and generated enough buzz that Khan was profiled by Steven Pearlstein in the Washington Post. In the still-small world of people who think and talk about monopoly and antitrust, Khan had become an overnight sensation. That was powerful evidence that there was pent-up demand for intellectual leadership on how to address the radical changes being wrought by tech giants like Amazon.</p><p>While a threshold number of Democratic wonks were now behind an anti-monopoly push, elected officials needed some assurance that voters would reward them for sticking their necks out on an unfamiliar topic. A slew of Washington Monthly articles had insisted that anti-monopoly policy would be good electoral politics, but there was never any evidence. That changed in April with a poll conducted by Hart Research Associates. The poll presented voters with a battery of questions and scenarios to probe their feelings on corporate consolidation.</p><p>The poll found that voters were much more worried about how the very rich use their power to benefit themselves than about excessive government regulation. Eighty-six percent agreed with the statement \"Our economy is increasingly dominated by a small number of very large corporations,\" and nearly 60 percent, including Rust Belt voters, said they were \"extremely concerned\" that \"(c]orporate monopolies control too much of our economy and our political system.\"</p><p>Maybe the wonks were onto something.</p><p>Let's not exaggerate. The Democratic Party is not suddenly the anti-monopoly party in the way that Reagan's GOP became the party of deregulation and Trump's has become the party of nativism and white grievance (and more deregulation). The Better Deal is just an elaborate set of talking points, and the section on competition and consolidation is one of many--too many, you might say--policy items. The 2018 congressional candidates are free to pick and choose whichever elements of the agenda they want, if any. In the upcoming midterms, former Obama administration officials Lillian Salerno and Austin Frerick are running on anti-monopoly platforms in Texas and Iowa, respectively, as David Dayen reported for the Intercept. But that's two among dozens. Doug Jones, currently running in the December special election for Jeff Sessions's vacant Senate seat, doesn't mention anything about consolidation, or anything else Better Deal related, on his campaign's issues page.</p><p>It's true that important figures in the party seem convinced that taking on monopolies is an important idea. Keith Ellison, a leader of the party's progressive wing in the House and the second-in-command of the Democratic National Committee, has taken to anti-monopoly with gusto. Over the summer he recorded a half-hour podcast discussion with his colleague Ro Khanna, a freshman congressman from a district including Silicon Valley, on all things monopoly and competition. When I spoke with Ellison in his office in September, he was in the middle of reading Barry Lynn's Cornered and Jonathan Taplin's recent book, Move Fast and Break Things, about the dangers of big tech.</p><p>\"I'm not into this to try to advance a political position,\" he said. \"I actually believe that monopolies and cartels are bad. It is truly something that I believe in. But from a political standpoint, Democrats are always trying to figure out, how do we work for the consumer and the small business person? Well, this issue opens the door to that.\"</p><p>On the Senate side, in late September, Senator Amy Klobuchar--seen as a possible 2020 presidential candidate--introduced a bill into the antitrust committee, of which she's the ranking Democrat, titled the \"Merger Enforcement Improvement Act,\" which would give antitrust enforcers more information on the effects of mergers. Its nine cosponsors--all Democrats--include Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, also potential 2020 candidates.</p><p>But these are baby steps. Turning anti-monopoly into winning electoral politics, as Chuck Schumer hopes, and into successful policy, if Democrats ever take back power, presents a number of challenges.</p><p>First, Democrats need to figure out how to discuss it in a way that connects with voters. \"The lesson out of the election is: really detailed, well-tuned plans on a wide range of issues do not capture the public's imagination as well as a smaller number of bold clear ideas that represent values,\" said Andy Green, the managing director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress. So far, there's no proof that Democrats can tum anti-monopoly ideas into statements of core values. Tom Perriello ran in the Virginia gubernatorial primary on a message built partly on addressing consolidation, and lost handily to uberestablishment candidate Ralph Northam. Zephyr Teachout ran for Congress in a New York district that Trump won, and lost by nine points. The candidacies of Frerick and Salerno will be important test cases.</p><p>Part of the appeal of focusing on consolidation is that it's a pocketbook issue: mergers have jacked up the prices of things that really matter to ordinary people, including medicine, airfare, and internet access. The April polling by Hart Research found that \"rising prices for essentials\" topped respondents' economic concerns, and a slim majority rated \"corporate monopolies are raising the prices we all pay\" as an \"extremely serious\" concern.</p><p>But the pocketbook paradigm could be a trap. Voting is more an expression of tribal identity than a rational bet on the practical effects of policy. Promising to help voters' bottom line only works if they trust you in the first place. And focusing just on prices ignores the issue of small business and regional competition. Cheap consumer goods can't make up for the lost jobs and wages in the large swaths of the country denuded of local businesses by behemoths on the coasts.</p><p>Sticking to the price argument also doesn't address what may be the most urgent front in the war over consolidation: big tech. Giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook pose threats to our democracy that aren't captured by prices, as recent revelations about how Russia used Facebook and Twitter to influence the election illustrate. For consumers, Google and Facebook's products are free; Amazon, meanwhile, is beloved for its low prices and exceptional service. Building a new anti-monopoly movement that confronts the issues posed by these tech giants will require a vocabulary for how their dominance threatens not consumer prices but, rather, the existence of competitive markets, media, and freedom itself--interests that were part of the antitrust movement before the Borkian revolution.</p><p>\"If you just leave it in the arena of, 'Oh, I want to order some sneakers online and I'll get them tomorrow and they're a pretty decent price,' then we're sunk,\" said Ellison. \"You can hope and pray that Chipotle opens up a restaurant in your neighborhood, and hope that a Walmart comes, and hope that a monopolist blesses you with their presence. Or you can fight the monopoly, keep the markets deconcentrated, and maybe open up your own shoe store, restaurant, or whatever. Maybe ... we could return to interesting, local culture again, which these people are destroying.\"</p><p>This will require angering some of the Democrats' most important and deep-pocketed donors, something the party has not yet revealed an appetite for. lhe Better Deal, like the party platform before it, didn't say a mumbling word about the new tech giants. (Klobuchar and her colleague Mark Warner did recently propose a bill that would force Facebook to disclose more information about political ads on the site.)</p><p>\"They can start infecting--some people argue they already have--the whole of Washington,\" said Ellison, referring to monopolists and their lobbyists. \"You can get members of Congress to be like, 'Monopoly? What are monopolies? We like monopolies, monopolies are awesome.'\"</p><p>Reforming competition policy will also trigger pushback from the antitrust bar. Herbert Hovenkamp, the leading antitrust scholar, agreed that enforcement has been too lax, but warned that going back to a pre-Bork approach that looked out for small businesses and workers, not just consumer prices, \"would drive the economy back into the Stone Age.\" In his view, the economic boom times of the New Deal and Warren Court eras happened in spite of antitrust enforcement, not because of it.</p><p>If Democrats have the skill and guts to take on these challenges, though, the rewards of an agenda that prioritizes breaking down monopolization could be big. Today the owners of America's nearly thirty million small businesses tend to lean Republican. A movement to take small business's side against the corporate Goliaths marauding the economy could change that dynamic. The tech industry itself is full of small and mediumsized firms that would surely support a movement to rein in the likes of Google and Amazon.</p><p>More broadly, an anti-monopoly, pro-competition agenda offers Democrats a way to make sense of what has gone so deeply wrong in our political and economic system without embracing either the revolutionary anti-capitalism of the far left or the anti-government nihilism of the right. Another way to say this is that anti-monopoly politics is a traditional American position--\"the middle ground,\" as Republican Senator Orrin Hatch recently put it, \"between intrusive public management and corrosive private conduct.\" (On the other hand, Hatch defends the Bork consumer welfare approach and has teasingly labeled those who disagree \"hipster antitrust.\")</p><p>\"I used to go to a lot of Tea Party rallies,\" said Zephyr Teachout. \"They had a satisfying story: 'You're out of power because of big government.' And the Democrats' message has been, 'You're not out of power.' That denied people's stories. The only way to counter the Tea Party is to give people another story about why they're out of power. If there's the Tooth Fairy and nothing, I'm going with the Tooth Fairy.\"</p><p>Trump, like any salesman, understood that. He won the industrial Midwest by pretending that kicking out Mexicans and renegotiating NAFTA would bring back the good jobs. The Democrats need a better, truer story. In beginning to push back against a monopolized economy, they just might have found one.</p><p>Gilad Edelman is editor at the Washington Monthly.</p><p>Caption: Intense concentration: Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, has embraced the argument, championed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, that Democrats must fight back against market consolidation.</p><p>Caption: The iconoclast: Robert Bork's 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox utterly upended the field of antitrust law.</p><p>Caption: The journalist: Barry Lynn set out to document the real-world consequences of corporate consolidation.</p><p>Caption: The insider: While studying law at Yale, Michael Shapiro provided a conduit between academia and the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p><p>Caption: The Wunderkind: Lina Khan's work on antitrust while still a law student drew the attention of Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>Caption: The establishment: As chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman added the White House's authority to the argument against consolidation.</p><p>Caption: The pilot project: Zephyr Teachout has unsuccessfully run for office on an anti-monopoly platform.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-515578385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 515578385</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-VDP1-JCBJ-K1HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8272\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Washington Monthly Company</copyright><publicationName>Washington Monthly</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0043-0633</issn><volume>Vol. 49</volume><issueNumber>No. 11-12\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 1, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Cover story</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Clinton, Hillary Rodham</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Longman, Phillip</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Schumer, Chuck</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Discount Stores</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>General interest</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Comedians</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Discount stores</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislators</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Monopolies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Officials and employees</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political activity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political parties</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Public affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Executive changes &amp;

The tech companies say the ban was in an effort to cut down on misinformation campaigns as well as a response to Jones's clearly violating user policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jones has long been known for his far-right website, Infowars, which holds a self-proclaimed mission of protecting the \"spirit of humanity\" and the freedom of the American people. Jones sees himself as a news source capable of cutting out the agendas and malicious intentions present in the media today and prioritizes \"exposing the scientifically engineered lies of the globalists and their ultimate goal of enslaving humanity.\"</p><p>On his website, Jones claims his \"truth-bringing\" company has been repeatedly targeted over the years. He also said Infowars is \"merely the canary in the coal mine when it comes to the leftist authoritarian censorship coming our way if good people stand idly by and do nothing.\"</p><p>The only problem is, it's not censorship.</p><p>Since late last year, though, one of his larger campaigns has been about the importance of not only protecting freedom of speech but saving it from extinction. He believes his banishment from certain social media platforms is a clear violation of his rights - such an egregious violation that he needed to devote 50 hours to it - but he fails to see how mistaken he is.</p><p>The tech companies who banned him say that he's directly glorified and encouraged violence - Jones was briefly suspended from Twitter after he tweeted a link to a video calling for supporters to get their \"battle rifles\" ready against the media and others, for example.</p><p>However, Jones cannot complain about being banned when he clearly violated outlined rules. Twitter stated that Jones violated aspects of its \"Abusive Behavior\" policy and banned him due to content that included Jones repeatedly degrading Muslims, attacking people on the basis of gender identity, and engaging in harassment.</p><p>It's not a confusing case of censorship, it's a case of not following the rules. As a private company, and one that requires users to sign off on terms of service before using their product, Twitter is not mandated to accept speech they deem excessively inappropriate according to community standards.</p><p>Conflating freedom of speech with the necessity of private entities to uphold their own rules and expectations is dangerous. Doing so blurs the line between government involvement and private action. And while social media platforms have become extremely accessible forums for public thought, they still remain private companies with the right to push their own self-created rules for a product. If Jones wants to campaign for the regulation of such forums by the government, and the consequent ability to monitor these sites according to the constitutional boundaries of the First Amendment, I would support that endeavor far more than his current ideas.</p><p>Furthermore, I recognize the legal nuances of free speech and its inapplicability, at times, to the private world. The Constitution forbids Congress or the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,\" but private entities reserve the right to police the speech and general conduct of people using their services.</p><p>Censorship is a grave and potentially dangerous action, one that should be a last resort of last resorts. Jones, however, by loosely throwing the term around, trivializes censorship.</p><p>Alex Jones and his media outlets contribute nothing substantial to the public discourse. In fact, he severely impedes potential social progress by peddling misinformation, performative lies, and incitements of violence. And through campaigns like \"Save the First Amendment,\" he further undermines serious, productive conversations on free speech and censorship and promotes an aggressive, unnecessarily radical, conspiracy-theory-filled ideology.</p><p>In 2017, during a custody battle for his kids against his wife, Jones's lawyer said, \"He's playing a character. He's a performance artist.\" And recently, as defamation lawsuits by families of the Sandy Hook tragedy continue to develop, Jones has evolved his defense to new levels of desperation. Now, Jones pins his mistaken actions on \"a form of psychosis.\"</p><p>Jones survives by playing on doubt and fear. He builds his conspiracies on one sound piece of information, constructing houses of cards that tap into the shadows of doubts about any and all governmental or societal structures. Listeners are sucked in by his fast-paced, enthusiastic, gruff, confident voice. He asserts these conspiracies wholeheartedly, and it can be convincing.</p><p>If he remained on social media platforms espousing his lies, only the public would suffer. I believe Jones deserves a voice, as all Americans do, which he has found on Infowars; but apart from that, nothing more is required. It's wrong to misconstrue censorship with what some might describe as a liberal agenda, and, to me, censoring Jones is a common-sense business and moral decision. Private companies can choose to do as they please. And I for one am glad Jones is no longer protected by social media platforms.</p><p>Arman Badrei is a first-year from Houston, Texas.

Unleashed during workdays, its sonic burst startles people, given it comes from as harsh and driven a taskmaster as exists on the stage of corporate giantism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is Bezos's outward giddiness a worrisome reflection of what Bezos is feeling on the inside? Is he laughing at all of us?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is Bezos laughing at the tax collectors, having avoided paying \u00a0most states' sales taxes for years on all the billions of books he sold online, thereby giving him an immediate 6 to 9 percent price advantage over brick-and-mortar bookstores, that also paid property taxes to support local schools and public facilities? That, and being an early online bookseller, gave Bezos his crucial foothold, along with other forms of tax avoidance that big companies utilize.</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at the bureaucratic labor unions, that somehow can't get a new handle on organizing the tens of thousands of exploited blue collar workers crying for help in Amazon warehouses and other stress-driven installations? With a net-worth over $80 billion, why should he worry?</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at the giant retailers, who are closing hundreds of stores because their thin margins cannot withstand Amazon's predatory pricing?</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division which, before Trump, was studying how old antitrust laws could be used to challenge monopolizing Molochs such as Amazon in the 21st century? It is time for antitrust officials to explore \u00a0new regulatory actions and modern legislation to deal with today's conglomerates.</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at Main Street, USA which he is in the process of hollowing out; along with nearby shopping malls who can't figure out how to supersede the convenience of online shopping with convivial ground shopping experience?</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at Walmart, bestirring itself, which is starting to feel like giant Sears Roebuck did before Walmart's relentless practices caught up and crushed what is now a shrunken, fragile Sears?</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at the United States Postal Service, to which he has given \u2013 for the time being \u2013 much business for shipping Amazon's packages? Bezos has no intention of this being a long term arrangement. Imagine Amazon with its own fleet of driverless vehicles and drones. Amazon is already using part-time workers to deliver its wares.</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at the Washington Post, which he bought for a song in 2014 while he was holding down a large contract with the CIA and other government agencies?</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at Alibaba, the huge (bigger than Amazon) Chinese online seller that is trying but failing to get a toehold in the US market? It is hard to match Amazon's ruthlessness on its home turf. Is Bezos laughing at people's manipulated susceptibility for convenience, hooking them with $99 a year for free shipping? Ordering from their computer or cell phone for speedy delivery to sedentary living, Amazon's customers are robbed of the experience of actively going to local businesses where they can personally engage with others, get offered on the spot bargains and build relationships for all kinds of social, civic and charitable activities.</p><p>Is Bezos laughing at many millions of Amazon customers who think temporary discounts and minor shipping convenience can make up for the billions of tax dollars Amazon has learned to avoid and the thousands of small business competitors whose closures shrink the local property tax base that supports schools and other essential public services?</p><p>As Amazon spreads around the world selling everything and \u00a0squeezing other businesses that use its platform, is Bezos laughing at humanity? His ultimate objective seems to preside over a mega-trillion dollar global juggernaut that is largely automated, except for that man at the top with the booming laugh who rules over the means by which we consume everything from goods, to media, to groceries. Crushing competitors, history shows, is leads to raising prices by monopolizers.</p><p>Consumers, workers and retailers alike must be on higher alert and address this growing threat. You have nothing to lose except Bezos's tightening algorithmic chains. To start the conversation, you can wait for Franklin Foer's new book out this September, titled World Without a Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech. Until then, a good substitute is his 2014 article in The New Republic, Amazon Must be Stopped.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-95346516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NYF-HYX1-F11P-X550-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 6, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001YOV</classCode><className>SEARS ROEBUCK &amp;

REUTERS</p><p>  MEDIA</p><p>Comcast Beats Forecast on Broadband Growth</p><p>Comcast on Thursday beat Wall Street's revenue and profit estimates as a result of growth in broadband customers, but the company lost more cable TV subscribers than expected and revenues at its NBC Universal unit were hurt as the film ''Cats'' bombed at the box office.</p><p>  Management said on the earnings call that it expected accelerating cable TV subscriber declines, which helped push the stock down 1.3 percent. Other media company shares were also down.</p><p>  Pay TV companies have been raising rates instead of trying to hang on to bargain-chasers who are cutting cable service. In the fourth quarter, Comcast lost 149,000 video customers, more than a loss of 139,000 estimated by research firm FactSet, but fewer than the 238,000 video customers it lost in the third quarter.</p><p>  It gained 442,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter.

Its iPhones and most of its products are powered by its Lightning cable, while Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors.</p><p>  ''We believe regulation that forces conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones stifles innovation rather than encouraging it,'' Apple said in a statement.

Attempts to both exploit and regulate digital connectivity have revealed deeply rooted and distinctly different notions of where and how to draw the virtual boundaries of market access, citizen autonomy and privacy - even within the West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sheer weight of China's global economic gravity is pulling others into the invasive maw of its digital orbit. Japan sees the vaunted new privacy rules that challenge big tech's abuses in Europe as online protectionism against its global companies.\u00a0The well-meaning effort to debureaucratize the delivery of social services through biometric e-administration in India threatens to erase privacy instead. Google's corporate vision of a smart city in Toronto has sparked a techlash by a local community that resists being digitally managed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In The WorldPost this week, we examine this digital clash of cultures emerging as the next terrain of future conflict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"China's digital privacy practices have sounded alarms in the West for years,\" Tiffany Li writes. \"Recent headlines about China highlight the growing use of\u00a0facial recognition\u00a0surveillance, the rise of the controversial\u00a0social credit system\u00a0and the development of other privacy-invasive technologies, including\u00a0brain-scanning helmets\u00a0that some employers use to try to evaluate how hard employees are working.\"</p><p>The rest of us should worry about China's practices, Li writes, because \"its rapidly advancing technology industries and massive consumer market are already influencing norms around the world. China will likely impact the way privacy is understood and protected.\"</p><p>The Yale scholar warns that the policy approaches to privacy that have worked across the West, where values are shared, won't work in China, which has its own tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent that conform to the communitarian and authoritarian ethos of its long-enduring civilization.</p><p>Li concludes: \"What is needed to influence the development of privacy norms in China is not American tech exceptionalism or European regulation but rather international, multi-stakeholder efforts that define the global values of privacy,\" including through trade policies.</p><p>          Hosuk Lee-Makiyama draws our attention to the conflict between commerce and personal privacy among trading partners. \"Europe has often been hailed as a global leader when it comes to trade and privacy, particularly after its recent passage of the General Data Protection Regulation, the European Union's privacy law that came into effect in May,\" he writes from Brussels. \"And while it is no doubt a worthwhile endeavor to protect European citizens from illicit online surveillance, the landmark bill comes at a cost: it is a form of digital protectionism. Like a rule straight out of President Trump's protectionist playbook, the regulation uses steep fines and red tape to put pressure on foreign businesses to set up local servers within Europe.\"</p><p>While Lee-Makiyama notes that this may not be an issue for Google, Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants with subsidiaries and servers within the E.U., \"companies that do not have the means to set up servers in every country where they operate - including major U.S. news sites such as the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune as well as various mobile apps - have blocked E.U. citizens from accessing their services in order to avoid fines.\"</p><p>Unlike Europe, he contends, \"Japan recognizes there is no contradiction between its domestic policy (to strengthen citizens' rights) and its foreign policy to ensure that multinationals are not facing discrimination on global markets and able to operate competitively in local markets.\"</p><p>          Reetika Khera worries that Aadhaar, the Indian national identification system that assigns a 12-digit number to citizens and verifies their identities through biometric scanning, has morphed from a transformative innovation for welfare delivery into an invasion of privacy.</p><p>\"In our increasingly digitized lives,\" she writes from Ahmedabad, India, \"sensitive personal information is available in various data silos: travel, banking, insurance, health records, education, social security, mobile phones and so on.\u00a0Data mining businesses\u00a0use this information to profile us and facilitate targeted advertising, for example. But an important safeguard of our privacy is that each of these data silos remains unconnected.\"</p><p>Her concern is that in India today, \"both the government and businesses are pushing people to submit their unique number for nearly every aspect of their lives - to receive welfare benefits such as pension payments, to file taxes and register marriages, as well as to access mobile phone services and bank accounts. This turns Aadhaar into a dangerous bridge between these previously isolated silos. With each new data silo that gets linked, an important protection against 360-degree profiling gets weakened, leaving Indians vulnerable to data mining and identity theft.\"</p><p>          Brian Barth reports from Toronto on the efforts of a local advocacy group called Tech Reset Canada that is challenging a celebrated plan by the Google-affiliated Sidewalk Labs to build a smart city. Endorsed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the company plans to build \"a testbed for new technologies\" in a waterfront district, using widely dispersed sensors and data analytics.</p><p>\"The smart city industry is a Trojan horse for technology companies,\" a leader of the group, Bianca Wylie, told Barth. \"They come in under the guise of environmentalism and improving quality of life, but they're here for money.\"</p><p>The Reset group, Barth relates, considers itself \"pro-growth\" and \"pro-innovation\" and is not opposed to the concept of smart cities. \"Their concerns,\" he writes, \"revolve around the collection and commodification of urban data and whether that occurs through a democratic process or via corporate fiat.\" He quotes Wylie: \"'This is a story about governance, not urban innovation. There is nothing innovative about partnering with a monopoly.'\"</p><p>The deeper digital connectivity reaches into every aspect of society, the more diverse cultural underpinnings will rise to the surface to cope with the consequences, each on their own terms. Some differences can be reconciled, others not. In the end, the boundaries in virtual space will be rendered in the image of the real world.</p><p>             This was produced by\u00a0                       The WorldPost                       , a partnership of the\u00a0                       Berggruen Institute                       \u00a0and The Washington Post.          </p><p>ABOUT US:\u00a0The WorldPost\u00a0is an award-winning global media platform that aims to be a place where the world meets.

Brands can build better relationships with their consumers and audiences if they are able to do that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It can also help preserve the long-term benefits of a digital economy that works for all. This is one of the central messages that emerges from the Digital Society Index 2019, a project of Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN) developed in collaboration with Oxford Economics, which combines a primary survey of more than 43,000 people across 24 countries with economic and statistical analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trust in big tech is falling. This survey first started in 2018, and even the collapse in trust in the use of digital technologies has been observed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The number-one cause of distrust is the misuse of personal data. Stronger regulation of technologies like artificial intelligence is being proposed.</p><p> And social media has been blamed for both political polarization and misinformation. Thirty years from the birth of the World Wide Web and against a longer-term trajectory of growth and prosperity brought about by the digital economy, 2018 has been a tough year.</p><p> Within that context, the Digital Society Index puts people at the heart of the digital economy to determine how trust can be rebuilt to deliver sustainable growth. To that end, a new needs-based framework has been developed.</p><p> Taking inspiration from the groundbreaking model of Abraham Maslow, his original \"hierarchy of needs\" concept has been tweaked for the digital age. However, research shows that in most of the 24 countries analyzed, these needs are far from being adequately addressed.</p><p> Basic needs: Access to digital infrastructure has always been a necessary condition to engage with the digital economy. But now, in addition, trust in the use of data is part of the foundation on which digital products and services must be built.</p><p> Only 49 percent of people globally believe their basic needs are being met, although Western economies tend to perform strongly here. Psychological needs: Digital technologies can help enhance users' sense of good health and well-being.</p><p> However, globally, only 38 percent of people believe this need is being met. Asian countries tend to perform poorly on this measure.</p><p>Singapore ranks lowest on psychological needs. Self-fulfillment needs: The extent to which people feel they have the right digital education, skills and opportunities for fulfilling work can offset concern about automation and the impact of artificial intelligence.</p><p> However, only 45 percent of people globally score positively on this measure, with under-utilization of digital skills by employers a challenge. For example, in Denmark, less than four out of 10 people with average or above-average digital skills agree that their employer makes it possible to use the full range and depth of their tech knowledge.</p><p> Societal needs: This is about people's broader optimism that digital technologies will be a force for good overall, helping to create jobs and solve societal challenges. Overall, less than half (49 percent) of people believe in digital's role here, although people in Asia tend to be much more positive about the potential of digital to enhance society.</p><p> The demographics of these trends show clear anomalies. Women score lower than men across all aspects of the model except basic needs.</p><p> In some countries, the gap is particularly stark. For example, in the Netherlands, 42 percent of men are optimistic about the societal impact of digital, but this falls to 30 percent for women.</p><p> And in terms of age, it is the younger people who score lowest on psychological needs, reflecting those studies that show how higher usage of digital technologies impact on young people's mental health and well-being negatively. Furthermore, while technological development accelerates, many people around the world feel left behind by digital growth.</p><p> This sentiment cuts across differences in economic development, tech maturity and culture. It's not just a first-world problem: it's a whole-world problem, with three major elements: first, skills are not keeping pace with needs.</p><p> Digital technologies are reshaping the jobs of tomorrow, but one in three people globally can't remember the last time they did any digital training (or have never done any). Second, the pace of technological change causes anxiety.</p><p> In countries such as China, India and Brazil, more than 80 percent of people feel the pace of tech change is too fast. Third, the future is not evenly spread.</p><p> While many countries perform strongly on the index in terms of delivering a digital economy that works for all  Singapore, the United States and China top the rankings in 2019  many countries are pursuing an imbalanced digital growth strategy. Belief in digital drives the business case for action.</p><p> This research analysis important for businesses and brands since digital needs influence consumer behavior. The new digital consumer is hardest to reach but most valuable.</p><p> The more positive people are about the digital economy's wider impact on society and their own digital skills, the more likely they are to engage with digital products and services. In other words, give people belief in digital and they will be more likely to use digital products and services.</p><p> There's not just an ethical case for delivering a digital economy that works for all, there's a strong business case, too. For example, a male digital native is fully engaged in terms of what the digital world can offer: shopping online, using apps to take a taxi and streaming music.</p><p> But he's also taking actions that, for many businesses, might seem problematic. As the research analysis shows, he's installing ad blockers, reducing data-sharing and deactivating social media accounts.</p><p> This is creating significant implications for brands, businesses and governments in the way they engage with consumers through digital products and services. Increasingly, this means brands will need to find new ways to maximize the value of precious moments of interaction with consumers, moving beyond reach to creating more meaningful moments of engagement.</p><p> How to respond to the new digital needs: The changing needs and awareness of consumers calls for a more balanced and creative approach to engaging people in digital products and services. It is no longer enough for organizations to rely on increasing access and extending the user base  that effort must be matched by innovation in developing a meaningful relationship with consumers.</p><p> Based on the research analysis, three recommendations each for brands, businesses and governments can be considered: For brands, traditional demographic approaches to segmenting consumers are insufficient. Looking at customers through the lens of digital needs can help brands find ways to increase positive engagement with digital products and services, as well as help test new services with more skeptical user groups.</p><p> Focus on engagement, not reach. The most valuable consumers are reducing the amount of data shared online, installing ad blockers and limiting their time online.</p><p> That means working harder to maximize the value of interactions that will often be initiated by consumers themselves. Help people undertake their own digital detox.</p><p> Enabling people to have a healthier relationship with digital may mean sacrificing access to data, but over the long-term it will lead to a better relationship based on trust. For businesses, compete on openness.</p><p> Transparency around data usage can be a source of differentiation. With misuse of personal data, the number-one driver of distrust in the tech industry today, any business ignores it at their peril.</p><p> Make better use of digital skills. Understand the digital skills that your employees have and constantly reimagine work processes and organizational design around the full spectrum of their abilities.</p><p> Showcase digital's societal potential. Promote the ways social impact programs and commercial offerings can help meet people's needs and wants.</p><p> For governments, develop a balanced scorecard of digital development. Metrics should focus on inclusion and trust alongside growth of digital industries.</p><p> Give people more control over digital innovation. By involving people in a more deliberative process of debate and discussion, governments can help shape a shared understanding of what is and what is not acceptable in terms of technology development.</p><p> Harness technology to enable effective learning. Ongoing training and immersive learning experiences will help leverage skills and unlock the potential of digital technologies.</p><p> It's a common soundbite that what's good for society is good for business. But it happens to be true.</p><p> As Tim Andree, executive chairman and CEO of DAN said, \"The digital economy gives us the power to be better versions of ourselves. Capitalizing on this means harnessing digital in the right way, with human needs placed squarely at the center.</p><p> By doing so, we can build better brands, better businesses and a better society. Let's make it real.</p><p>\"    Email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bongosorio@gmail.com\">bongosorio@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHISTR-PSTAR28042019115182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHISTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0J-PSB1-F00C-611W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433722</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 PhilSTAR Daily, Inc.

Without blinking an eye, it would later sell the once-mighty mobile phone manufacturer for $2.91 billion in 2014, having gained\u00a0the legal patents necessary to protect itself from iPhone maker Apple. It was a sign that Big Tech would dominate the decade to come.</p><p>Taking the near-$10 billion hit was worth it for the tech giant, as marketers followed prevailing media consumption habits and shifted their ad spend to mobile. In 2019, mobile accounted for two-thirds of all digital spend, totaling $87.06 billion, compared to 2012 when total\u00a0U.S. spend was just $2.61 billion.</p><p>EMarketer forecasts that\u00a0Amazon, Facebook and Google\u00a0will collectively pocket nearly 70% of all U.S. online media budgets, or $151.29 billion, next year alone. And with digital ad spend overtaking offline (or \u201ctraditional\u201d), it\u2019s clear Google played its cards right.</p><p>These players grew to assert such dominance over advertisers\u2019 budgets in this decade because of\u00a0their ability to collect huge swaths of data\u00a0across different devices\u2014connective tissue that can link ad spend to ROI, a marketer\u2019s dream.</p><p>Marketers were now equipped with improved campaign planning, implementation and measurement capabilities (provided they paid for it). And with Google, Facebook and Amazon in possession of more logged-in, authenticated data than just about anybody else, they were placed firmly in the seat of power.</p><p>The availability and use of this data, however, proved controversial. It was a narrative that played out not only in the boardrooms of Madison Avenue in the 2010s but also in Congress.</p><p>In 2018, the CEOs of both Facebook and Google were grilled by public representatives over data privacy as the result of outrage over the Cambridge Analytica data breach. The scandal alleged that\u00a0Facebook data was used by foreign powers to undermine the democratic process\u2014specifically, the 2016 presidential election and Brexit vote\u2014through a mix of fake news and ads that weren\u2019t fact-checked.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica breach was not the first incident of its kind, but its scale served to crystalize the dangers associated with big data as well as the sway such platforms hold in the public eye.</p><p>Lawmakers took note, and after years of drafting, May 2018 saw the\u00a0EU implement General Data Protection Regulations, echoed by similar regulations across the world, with CCPA passed only a month later.</p><p>These measures were undoubtedly implemented to curb the influence of Big Tech, but (ironically) the nature of the consent requirements at the core of such regulation has\u00a0only served to aid their business models. Walled gardens resulted: platforms requiring the public to sign in and consent to sharing their data with approved business partners, aka the media industry. For advertisers unsure as to the robustness of third-party data when it comes to privacy compliance, playing it safe meant concentrating their media spend within the walled gardens.</p><p>The extent of this lockout made itself evident fairly quickly. Even\u00a0Verizon Wireless\u2019 attempted challenge\u00a0to the hegemony of the major players fell short, with its Oath rollout involving a $4.6 billion write-down.</p><p>Meanwhile, the independent ad-tech sector, once the darling of venture capitalists, saw an increasing number of distressed exits and outright collapses as the decade wore on.\u00a0Amazon capitalized on this trend.</p><p>So, with CCPA poised to come into force in January and\u00a0U.S. presidential candidates openly talking about the break-up of Big Tech\u00a0in their election pledges, the digital media industry is on track for a political\u00a0jolt to the system in the coming years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April 2010</emphasis>Apple launches the iPad, a sign of the increasing prevalence of mobile devices, including wearables.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April 2010</emphasis>In pre-IPO mode, Facebook launches Open Graph, allowing third-party developers to access user data, a precursor to its later Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">May 2015</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>Verizon Wireless buys AOL for $4.4 billion, prefacing its $4.48 billion Yahoo purchase and subsequent merger.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">August 2015</emphasis>Google raises its walled garden even further and stops independent ad tech companies from reselling YouTube ad space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">May/June 2018</emphasis>GDPR goes into effect and CCPA is passed, scheduled for enforcement in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April 2018</emphasis>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears in front of Congress to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">December 2018</emphasis>Google CEO Sundar Pichai is questioned by Congress about the company\u2019s \u201cblack-box algorithms.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">March 2019</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>Presidential candidate Sen.

For tech firms, the headline is that Margrethe Vestager will not only retain her job as the head of DG Competition, she will also oversee the EU's entire digital markets policy in her new role as Vice-President in charge of digital policy. Her promotion within the Commission as well as her track record at DG Competition both suggest that the digital economy will continue to be the fulcrum of European competition and regulatory intervention for the next five years.The regulation (or not) of digital markets is an extremely important topic. Not only do we spend vast swaths of both our professional and personal lives online, but firms operating in digital markets will likely employ an ever-increasing share of the labor force in the near future[1].Likely recognizing the growing importance of the digital economy, the previous EU Commission intervened heavily in the digital sphere over the past five years. </p><p>This resulted in a series of high-profile regulations (including the GDPR[2], the platform-to-business regulation[3], and the reform[4] of EU copyright) and competition law decisions (most notably the Google cases).Lauded by supporters of the administrative state, these interventions have drawn flak from numerous corners. This includes foreign politicians (especially Americans[5]) who see in these measures an attempt to protect the EU's tech industry from its foreign rivals, as well as free market enthusiasts who argue that the old continent has moved further in the direction of digital paternalism.Vestager's increased role within the new Commission, the EU's heavy regulation of digital markets over the past five years, and early pronouncements from Ursula von der Leyen all suggest that the EU is in for five more years of significant government intervention in the digital sphere. Vestager the slayer of Big Tech During her five years as Commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager has repeatedly been called the most powerful woman in Brussels (see here[6] and here[7]), and it is easy to see why. Yielding the heavy hammer of European competition and state aid enforcement, she has relentlessly attacked the world's largest firms, especially American's so-called 'Tech Giants'.The record-breaking fines imposed on Google were probably her most high-profile victory. When Vestager entered office, in 2014, the EU's case against Google had all but stalled. The Commission and Google had spent the best part of four years[8] haggling over a potential remedy[9] that was ultimately thrown out[10]. Grabbing the bull by the horns, Margrethe Vestager made the case her own.Five years, three infringement decisions, and \u20ac[11]8.25 billion[12] euros later, Google probably wishes it had managed to keep the 2014 settlement alive. While Vestager's supporters claim that justice was served, Barack Obama[13] and Donald Trump[14], among others[15], branded her a protectionist (although, as Geoffrey Manne and I have noted, the evidence for this is decidedly mixed[16]). Critics also argued that her decisions would harm innovation and penalize consumers (see here[17] and here[18]). Regardless, the case propelled Vestager into the public eye. It turned her into one of the most important political forces in Brussels. Cynics might even suggest that this was her plan all along.But Google is not the only tech firm to have squared off with Vestager. Under her watch, Qualcomm was slapped with a total of \u20ac1.239 Billion[19] in fines. The Commission also opened an investigation[20] into Amazon's operation of its online marketplace. If previous cases are anything to go by, the probe will most probably end with a headline-grabbing fine. The Commission even launched a probe[21] into Facebook's planned Libra cryptocurrency, even though it has yet to be launched[22], and recent talk suggests it may never be[23]. Finally, in the area of state aid enforcement, the Commission ordered Ireland to recover \u20ac13 Billion[24] in allegedly undue tax benefits from Apple. Margrethe Vestager also initiated a large-scale consultation on competition in the digital economy. The ensuing report[25] concluded that the answer was more competition enforcement. Its findings will likely be cited by the Commission as further justification to ramp up its already significant competition investigations in the digital sphere.Outside of the tech sector, Vestager has shown that she is not afraid to adopt controversial decisions. Blocking the proposed merger between Siemens and Alstom[26] notably drew the ire[27] of Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, as the deal would have created a European champion in the rail industry (a key political demand in Germany and France).These numerous interventions all but guarantee that Vestager will not be pushing for light touch regulation in her new role as Vice-President in charge of digital policy. Vestager is also unlikely to put a halt to some of the 'Big Tech' investigations that she herself launched during her previous spell at DG Competition. Finally, given her evident political capital in Brussels, it's a safe bet that she will be given significant leeway to push forward landmark initiatives of her choosing. Vestager the prophet Beneath these attempts to rein-in 'Big Tech' lies a deeper agenda that is symptomatic of the EU's current zeitgeist. Over the past couple of years, the EU has been steadily blazing a trail in digital market regulation (although much less so in digital market entrepreneurship and innovation[28]). Underlying this push is a worldview that sees consumers and small startups as the uninformed victims of gigantic tech firms. True to form, the EU's solution to this problem is more regulation and government intervention. This is unlikely to change given the Commission's new (old) leadership.If digital paternalism is the dogma, then Margrethe Vestager is its prophet. As Thibault Schrepel has shown[29], her speeches routinely call for digital firms to act 'fairly', and for policymakers to curb their 'power'. According to her, it is our democracy that is at stake. In her own words[30], 'you can't sensibly talk about democracy today, without appreciating the enormous power of digital technology'. And yet, if history tells us one thing, it is that heavy-handed government intervention is anathema to liberal democracy.The Commission's Google decisions neatly illustrate this worldview. For instance, in Google Shopping, the Commission concluded that Google was coercing consumers into using its own services, to the detriment of competition. But the Google Shopping decision focused entirely on competitors, and offered no evidence showing actual harm to consumers (see here[31]). Could it be that users choose Google's products because they actually prefer them? Rightly or wrongly, the Commission went to great lengths to dismiss evidence that arguably pointed in this direction (see here[32], 506-538).Other European forays into the digital space are similarly paternalistic. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR[33]) assumes that consumers are ill-equipped to decide what personal information they share with online platforms. Queue a deluge of time-consuming consent forms and cookie-related pop-ups. The jury is still out on whether the GDPR has improved users' privacy. But it has been extremely costly for businesses \u2014 American S...00 companies and UK FTSE 350 companies alone spent an estimated total of $9 billion[34] to comply with the GDPR \u2014 and has at least temporarily slowed[35] venture capital investment in Europe.Likewise, the recently adopted Regulation[36] on platform-to-business relations operates under the assumption that small firms routinely fall prey to powerful digital platforms:Given that increasing dependence, the providers of those services [i.e. digital platforms] often have superior bargaining power, which enables them to, in effect, behave unilaterally in a way that can be unfair and that can be harmful to the legitimate interests of their businesses users and, indirectly, also of consumers in the Union. For instance, they might unilaterally impose on business users practices which grossly deviate from good commercial conduct, or are contrary to good faith and fair dealing.But the platform-to-business Regulation conveniently overlooks the fact that economic opportunism[37] is a two-way street. Small startups are equally capable of behaving in ways that greatly harm the reputation and profitability of much larger platforms. The Cambridge Analytica[38] leak springs to mind. And what's 'unfair' to one small business may offer massive benefits to other businesses and consumers[39].Make what you will about the underlying merits of these individual policies, we should at least recognize that they are part of a greater whole, where Brussels is regulating ever greater aspects of our online lives \u2014 and not clearly for the benefit of consumers.With Margrethe Vestager now overseeing even more of these regulatory initiatives, readers should expect more of the same. The Mission Letter[40] she received from Ursula von der Leyen is particularly enlightening in that respect:I want you to coordinate the work on upgrading our liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products as part of a new Digital Services Act.I want you to focus on strengthening competition enforcement in all sectors. A hard rain's a gonna fall on Big Tech Today's announcements all but confirm that the EU will stay its current course in digital markets. This is unfortunate.Digital firms currently provide consumers with tremendous benefits at no direct charge. A recent study[41] shows that median users would need to be paid \u20ac15,875 to give up search engines for a year. They would also require \u20ac536 in order to forgo WhatsApp for a month, \u20ac97 for Facebook, and \u20ac59 to drop digital maps for the same duration.By continuing to heap ever more regulations on successful firms, the EU risks killing the goose that laid the golden egg. This is not just a theoretical possibility. The EU's policies have already put technology firms under huge stress, and it is not clear that this has always been outweighed by benefits to consumers. The GDPR has notably caused numerous[42] foreign firms to stop offering their services in Europe. And the EU's Google decisions have forced it to start charging[43] manufacturers for some of its apps. Are these really victories for European consumers?It is also worth asking why there are so few European leaders in the digital economy. Not so long ago, European firms such as Nokia and Ericsson were at the forefront of the digital revolution. Today, with the possible exception of Spotify, the EU has fallen further down the global pecking order in the digital economy.The EU knows this, and plans to invest \u20ac100 Billion[44] in order to boost European tech startups. But these sums will be all but wasted if excessive regulation threatens the long-term competitiveness of European startups.So if more of the same government intervention isn't the answer, then what is? Recognizing that consumers have agency and are responsible for their own decisions might be a start. If you don't like Facebook, close your account. Want a search engine that protects your privacy? Try DuckDuckGo. If YouTube and Spotify's suggestions don't appeal to you, create your own playlists and turn off the autoplay functions. The digital world has given us more choice than we could ever have dreamt of; but this comes with responsibility. Both Margrethe Vestager and the European institutions have often seemed oblivious to this reality.If the EU wants to turn itself into a digital economy powerhouse, it will have to switch towards light-touch regulation that allows firms to experiment with disruptive services, flexible employment options, and novel monetization strategies. But getting there requires a fundamental rethink \u2014 one that the EU's previous leadership refused to contemplate. Margrethe Vestager's dual role within the next Commission suggests that change isn't coming any time soon.The post The Digital Policy of the Next EU Commission: All roads Lead to Margrethe Vestager[45] appeared first on Truth on the Market[46].

There is a gated community here, but it is not the usual kind. The gate is low-a picket fence-as if to prevent the dunes from riding up into the street. The entrance is blocked by a railroad-crossing arm, not so much to keep out strangers as to make sure they come with intent. Beyond the gate, there is a schoolhouse, and a few homes line a narrow drive. From Tallinn, Estonia's capital, you arrive dazed: trees trace the highway, and the cars go fast, as if to get in front of something that no one can see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within this gated community lives a man, his family, and one vision of the future. Taavi Kotka, who spent four years as Estonia's chief information officer, is one of the leading public faces of a project known as e-Estonia: a co\u00f6rdinated governmental effort to transform the country from a state into a digital society.</p><p>E-Estonia is the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today, for it includes all members of the government, and alters citizens' daily lives. The normal services that government is involved with-legislation, voting, education, justice, health care, banking, taxes, policing, and so on-have been digitally linked across one platform, wiring up the nation. A lawn outside Kotka's large house was being trimmed by a small robot, wheeling itself forward and nibbling the grass.</p><p>\"Everything here is robots,\" Kotka said. \"Robots here, robots there.\" He sometimes felt that the lawnmower had a soul. \"At parties, it gets close to people,\" he explained.</p><p>A curious wind was sucking in a thick fog from the water, and Kotka led me inside. His study was cluttered, with a long table bearing a chessboard and a bowl of foil-wrapped wafer chocolates (a mark of hospitality at Estonian meetings). A four-masted model ship was perched near the window; in the corner was a pile of robot toys.</p><p>\"We had to set a goal that resonates, large enough for the society to believe in,\" Kotka went on.</p><p>He is tall with thin blond hair that, kept shaggy, almost conceals its recession. He has the liberated confidence, tinged with irony, of a cardplayer who has won a lot of hands and can afford to lose some chips.</p><p>It was during Kotka's tenure that the e-Estonian goal reached its fruition. Today, citizens can vote from their laptops and challenge parking tickets from home. They do so through the \"once only\" policy, which dictates that no single piece of information should be entered twice. Instead of having to \"prepare\" a loan application, applicants have their data-income, debt, savings-pulled from elsewhere in the system. There's nothing to fill out in doctors' waiting rooms, because physicians can access their patients' medical histories. Estonia's system is keyed to a chip-I.D. card that reduces typically onerous, integrative processes-such as doing taxes-to quick work. \"If a couple in love would like to marry, they still have to visit the government location and express their will,\" Andrus Kaarelson, a director at the Estonian Information Systems Authority, says. But, apart from transfers of physical property, such as buying a house, all bureaucratic processes can be done online.</p><p>Estonia is a Baltic country of 1.3 million people and four million hectares, half of which is forest. Its government presents this digitization as a cost-saving efficiency and an equalizing force. Digitizing processes reportedly saves the state two per cent of its G.D.P. a year in salaries and expenses. Since that's the same amount it pays to meet the NATO threshold for protection (Estonia-which has a notably vexed relationship with Russia-has a comparatively small military), its former President Toomas Hendrik Ilves liked to joke that the country got its national security for free.</p><p>Other benefits have followed. \"If everything is digital, and location-independent, you can run a borderless country,\" Kotka said. In 2014, the government launched a digital \"residency\" program, which allows logged-in foreigners to partake of some Estonian services, such as banking, as if they were living in the country. Other measures encourage international startups to put down virtual roots; Estonia has the lowest business-tax rates in the European Union, and has become known for liberal regulations around tech research. It is legal to test Level 3 driverless cars (in which a human driver can take control) on all Estonian roads, and the country is planning ahead for Level 5 (cars that take off on their own). \"We believe that innovation happens anyway,\" Viljar Lubi, Estonia's deputy secretary for economic development, says. \"If we close ourselves off, the innovation happens somewhere else.\"</p><p>\"It makes it so that, if one country is not performing as well as another country, people are going to the one that is performing better-competitive governance is what I'm calling it,\" Tim Draper, a venture capitalist at the Silicon Valley firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and one of Estonia's leading tech boosters, says. \"We're about to go into a very interesting time where a lot of governments can become virtual.\"</p><p>Previously, Estonia's best-known industry was logging, but Skype was built there using mostly local engineers, and countless other startups have sprung from its soil. \"It's not an offshore paradise, but you can capitalize a lot of money,\" Thomas Padovani, a Frenchman who co-founded the digital-ad startup Adcash in Estonia, explains. \"And the administration is light, all the way.\" A light touch does not mean a restricted one, however, and the guiding influence of government is everywhere.</p><p>As an engineer, Kotka said, he found the challenge of helping to construct a digital nation too much to resist. \"Imagine that it's your task to build the Golden Gate Bridge,\" he said excitedly. \"You have to change the whole way of thinking about society.\" So far, Estonia is past halfway there.</p><p>One afternoon, I met a woman named Anna Piperal at the e-Estonia Showroom. Piperal is the \"e-Estonia ambassador\"; the showroom is a permanent exhibit on the glories of digitized Estonia, from Skype to Timbeter, an app designed to count big piles of logs. (Its founder told me that she'd struggled to win over the wary titans of Big Log, who preferred to count the inefficient way.) Piperal has blond hair and an air of brisk, Northern European professionalism. She pulled out her I.D. card; slid it into her laptop, which, like the walls of the room, was faced with blond wood; and typed in her secret code, one of two that went with her I.D. The other code issues her digital signature-a seal that, Estonians point out, is much harder to forge than a scribble.</p><p>\"This PIN code just starts the whole decryption process,\" Piperal explained. \"I'll start with my personal data from the population registry.\" She gestured toward a box on the screen. \"It has my document numbers, my phone number, my e-mail account. Then there's real estate, the land registry.\" Elsewhere, a box included all of her employment information; another contained her traffic records and her car insurance. She pointed at the tax box. \"I have no tax debts; otherwise, that would be there. And I'm finishing a master's at the Tallinn University of Technology, so here\"-she pointed to the education box-\"I have my student information. If I buy a ticket, the system can verify, automatically, that I'm a student.\" She clicked into the education box, and a detailed view came up, listing her previous degrees.</p><p>\"My cat is in the pet registry,\" Piperal said proudly, pointing again. \"We are done with the vaccines.\"</p><p>Data aren't centrally held, thus reducing the chance of Equifax-level breaches. Instead, the government's data platform, X-Road, links individual servers through end-to-end encrypted pathways, letting information live locally. Your dentist's practice holds its own data; so does your high school and your bank. When a user requests a piece of information, it is delivered like a boat crossing a canal via locks.</p><p>Although X-Road is a government platform, it has become, owing to its ubiquity, the network that many major private firms build on, too. Finland, Estonia's neighbor to the north, recently began using X-Road, which means that certain data-for instance, prescriptions that you're able to pick up at a local pharmacy-can be linked between the nations. It is easy to imagine a novel internationalism taking shape in this form. Toomas Ilves, Estonia's former President and a longtime driver of its digitization efforts, is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford, and says he was shocked at how retrograde U.S. bureaucracy seems even in the heart of Silicon Valley. \"It's like the nineteen-fifties-I had to provide an electrical bill to prove I live here!\" he exclaimed. \"You can get an iPhone X, but, if you have to register your car, forget it.\"</p><p>X-Road is appealing due to its rigorous filtering: Piperal's teachers can enter her grades, but they can't access her financial history, and even a file that's accessible to medical specialists can be sealed off from other doctors if Piperal doesn't want it seen.</p><p>\"I'll show you a digital health record,\" she said, to explain. \"A doctor from here\"-a file from one clinic-\"can see the research that this doctor\"-she pointed to another-\"does.\" She'd locked a third record, from a female-medicine practice, so that no other doctor would be able to see it. A tenet of the Estonian system is that an individual owns all information recorded about him or her. Every time a doctor (or a border guard, a police officer, a banker, or a minister) glances at any of Piperal's secure data online, that look is recorded and reported. Peeping at another person's secure data for no reason is a criminal offense. \"In Estonia, we don't have Big Brother; we have Little Brother,\" a local told me. \"You can tell him what to do and maybe also beat him up.\"</p><p>Business and land-registry information is considered public, so Piperal used the system to access the profile of an Estonian politician. \"Let's see his land registry,\" she said, pulling up a list of properties. \"You can see there are three land plots he has, and this one is located\"-she clicked, and a satellite photograph of a sprawling beach house appeared-\"on the sea.\"</p><p>The openness is startling. Finding the business interests of the rich and powerful-a hefty field of journalism in the United States-takes a moment's research, because every business connection or investment captured in any record in Estonia becomes searchable public information. (An online tool even lets citizens map webs of connection, follow-the-money style.) Traffic stops are illegal in the absence of a moving violation, because officers acquire records from a license-plate scan. Polling-place intimidation is a non-issue if people can vote-and then change their votes, up to the deadline-at home, online. And heat is taken off immigration because, in a borderless society, a resident need not even have visited Estonia in order to work and pay taxes under its dominion.</p><p>Soon after becoming the C.I.O., in 2013, Taavi Kotka was charged with an unlikely project: expanding Estonia's population. The motive was predominantly economic. \"Countries are like enterprises,\" he said. \"They want to increase the wealth of their own people.\"</p><p>Tallinn, a harbor city with a population just over four hundred thousand, does not seem to be on a path toward outsized growth. Not far from the cobbled streets of the hilly Old Town is a business center, where boxy Soviet structures have been supplanted by stylish buildings of a Scandinavian cast. Otherwise, the capital seems pleasantly preserved in time. The coastal daylight is bright and thick, and, when a breeze comes off the Baltic, silver-birch leaves shimmer like chimes. \"I came home to a great autumn\u00a0/\u00a0to a luminous landscape,\" the Estonian poet Jaan Kaplinski wrote decades ago. This much has not changed.</p><p>Kotka, however, thought that it was possible to increase the population just by changing how you thought of what a population was. Consider music, he said. Twenty years ago, you bought a CD and played the album through. Now you listen track by track, on demand. \"If countries are competing not only on physical talent moving to their country but also on how to get the best virtual talent connected to their country, it becomes a disruption like the one we have seen in the music industry,\" he said. \"And it's basically a zero-cost project, because we already have this infrastructure for our own people.\"</p><p>The program that resulted is called e-residency, and it permits citizens of another country to become residents of Estonia without ever visiting the place. An e-resident has no leg up at the customs desk, but the program allows individuals to tap into Estonia's digital services from afar.</p><p>I applied for Estonian e-residency one recent morning at my apartment, and it took about ten minutes. The application cost a hundred euros, and the hardest part was finding a passport photograph to upload, for my card. After approval, I would pick up my credentials in person, like a passport, at the Estonian Consulate in New York.</p><p>This physical task proved to be the main stumbling block, Ott Vatter, the deputy director of e-residency, explained, because consulates were reluctant to expand their workload to include a new document. Mild xenophobia made some Estonians at home wary, too. \"Inside Estonia, the mentality is kind of 'What is the gain, and where is the money?'\u00a0\" he said. The physical factor still imposes limitations-only thirty-eight consulates have agreed to issue documents, and they are distributed unevenly. (Estonia has only one embassy in all of Africa.) But the office has made special accommodations for several popular locations. Since there's no Estonian consulate in San Francisco, the New York consulate flies personnel to California every three months to batch-process Silicon Valley applicants.</p><p>\"I had a deal that I did with Funderbeam, in Estonia,\" Tim Draper, who became Estonia's second e-resident, told me. \"We decided to use a 'smart contract'-the first ever in a venture deal!\" Smart contracts are encoded on a digital ledger and, notably, don't require an outside administrative authority. It was an appealing prospect, and Draper, with his market investor's gaze, recognized a new market for \u00e9lite tech brainpower and capital. \"I thought, Wow! Governments are going to have to compete with each other for us,\" he said.</p><p>So far, twenty-eight thousand people have applied for e-residency, mostly from neighboring countries: Finland and Russia. But Italy and Ukraine follow, and U.K. applications spiked during Brexit. (Many applicants are footloose entrepreneurs or solo venders who want to be based in the E.U.) Because eighty-eight per cent of applicants are men, the United Nations has begun seeking applications for female entrepreneurs in India.</p><p>\"There are so many companies in the world for whom working across borders is a big hassle and a source of expense,\" Siim Sikkut, Estonia's current C.I.O., says. Today, in Estonia, the weekly e-residency application rate exceeds the birth rate. \"We tried to make more babies, but it's not that easy,\" he explained.</p><p>With so many businesses abroad, Estonia's startup-ism hardly leaves an urban trace. I went to visit one of the places it does show: a co-working space, Lift99, in a complex called the Telliskivi Creative City. The Creative City, a former industrial park, is draped with trees and framed by buildings whose peeling exteriors have turned the yellows of a worn-out sponge. There are murals, outdoor sculptures, and bills for coming shows; the space is shaped by communalism and by the spirit of creative unrule. One art work consists of stacked logs labelled with Tallinn startups: Insly, LeapIN, Photry, and something called 3D Creationist.</p><p>The office manager, Elina Kaarneem, greeted me near the entrance. \"Please remove your shoes,\" she said. Lift99, which houses thirty-two companies and five freelancers, had industrial windows, with a two-floor open-plan workspace. Both levels also included smaller rooms named for techies who had done business with Estonia. There was a Zennstr\u00f6m Room, after Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Swedish entrepreneur who co-founded Skype, in Tallinn. There was a Horowitz Room, for the venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, who has invested in Estonian tech. There was also a Tchaikovsky Room, because the composer had a summer house in Estonia and once said something nice about the place.</p><p>\"This is not the usual co-working space, because we choose every human,\" Ragnar Sass, who founded Lift99, exclaimed in the Hemingway Room. Hemingway, too, once said something about Estonia; a version of his pronouncement-\"No well-run yacht basin is complete without at least two Estonians\"-had been spray-stencilled on the wall, along with his face.</p><p>The room was extremely small, with two cushioned benches facing each other. Sass took one; I took the other. \"Many times, a miracle can happen if you put talented people in one room,\" he said as I tried to keep my knees inside my space. Not far from the Hemingway Room, Barack Obama's face was also on a wall. Obama Rooms are booths for making cell-phone calls, following something he once said about Estonia. (\"I should have called the Estonians when we were setting up our health-care Web site.\") That had been stencilled on the wall as well.</p><p>Some of the companies at Lift99 are local startups, but others are international firms seeking an Estonian foothold. In something called the Draper Room, for Tim Draper, I met an Estonian engineer, Margus Maantoa, who was launching the Tallinn branch of the German motion-control company Trinamic. Maantoa shares the room with other companies, and, to avoid disturbing them, we went to the Iceland Room. (Iceland was the first country to recognize Estonian independence.) The seats around the table in the Iceland Room were swings.</p><p>I took a swing, and Maantoa took another. He said, \"I studied engineering and physics in Sweden, and then, seven years ago, I moved back to Estonia because so much is going on.\" He asked whether I wanted to talk with his boss, Michael Randt, at the Trinamic headquarters, in Hamburg, and I said that I did, so he opened his laptop and set up a conference call on Skype. Randt was sitting at a table, peering down at us as if we were a mug of coffee. Tallinn had a great talent pool, he said: \"Software companies are absorbing a lot of this labor, but, when it comes to hardware, there are only a few companies around.\" He was an e-resident, so opening a Tallinn office was fast.</p><p>Maantoa took me upstairs, where he had a laboratory space that looked like a janitor's closet. Between a water heater and two large air ducts, he had set up a desk with a 3-D printer and a robotic motion-control platform. I walked him back to Draper and looked up another startup, an Estonian company called \u00d6\u00f6d, which makes one-room, two-hundred-square-foot huts that you can order prefab. The rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows of one-way glass, climate control, furniture, and lovely wood floors. They come in a truck and are dropped into the countryside.</p><p>\"Sometimes you want something small, but you don't want to be in a tent,\" Kaspar K\u00e4gu, the head of \u00d6\u00f6d sales, explained. \"You want a shower in the morning and your coffee and a beautiful landscape. Fifty-two per cent of Estonia is covered by forestland, and we're rather introverted people, so we want to be-uh, not near everybody else.\" People of a more sociable disposition could scatter these box homes on their property, he explained, and rent them out on services like Airbnb.</p><p>\"We like to go to nature-but comfortably,\" Andreas Tiik, who founded \u00d6\u00f6d with his carpenter brother, Jaak, told me. The company had queued preorders from people in Silicon Valley, who also liked the idea, and was tweaking the design for local markets. \"We're building a sauna in it,\" K\u00e4gu said.</p><p>In the U.S., it is generally assumed that private industry leads innovation. Many ambitious techies I met in Tallinn, though, were leaving industry to go work for the state. \"If someone had asked me, three years ago, if I could imagine myself working for the government, I would have said, 'Fuck no,'\u00a0\" Ott Vatter, who had sold his own business, told me. \"But I decided that I could go to the U.S. at any point, and work in an average job at a private company. This is so much bigger.\"</p><p>The bigness is partly inherent in the government's appetite for large problems. In Tallinn's courtrooms, judges' benches are fitted with two monitors, for consulting information during the proceedings, and case files are assembled according to the once-only principle. The police make reports directly into the system; forensic specialists at the scene or in the lab do likewise. Lawyers log on-as do judges, prison wardens, plaintiffs, and defendants, each through his or her portal. The Estonian courts used to be notoriously backlogged, but that is no longer the case.</p><p>\"No one was able to say whether we should increase the number of courts or increase the number of judges,\" Timo Mitt, a manager at Netgroup, which the government hired to build the architecture, told me. Digitizing both streamlined the process and helped identify points of delay. Instead of setting up prisoner transport to trial-fraught with security risks-Estonian courts can teleconference defendants into the courtroom from prison.</p><p>For doctors, a remote model has been of even greater use. One afternoon, I stopped at the North Estonia Medical Center, a hospital in the southwest of Tallinn, and met a doctor named Arkadi Popov in an alleyway where ambulances waited in line.</p><p>\"Welcome to our world,\" Popov, who leads emergency medical care, said grandly, gesturing with pride toward the chariots of the sick and maimed. \"Intensive care!\"</p><p>In a garage where unused ambulances were parked, he took an iPad Mini from the pocket of his white coat, and opened an \"e-ambulance\" app, which Estonian paramedics began using in 2015. \"This system had some childhood diseases,\" Popov said, tapping his screen. \"But now I can say that it works well.\"</p><p>E-ambulance is keyed onto X-Road, and allows paramedics to access patients' medical records, meaning that the team that arrives for your chest pains will have access to your latest cardiology report and E.C.G. Since 2011, the hospital has also run a telemedicine system-doctoring at a distance-originally for three islands off its coast. There were few medical experts on the islands, so the E.M.S. accepted volunteer paramedics. \"Some of them are hotel administrators, some of them are teachers,\" Popov said. At a command center at the hospital in Tallinn, a doctor reads data remotely.</p><p>\"On the screen, she or he can see all the data regarding the patient-physiological parameters, E.C.G.s,\" he said. \"Pulse, blood pressure, temperature. In case of C.P.R., our doctor can see how deep the compression of the chest is, and can give feedback.\" The e-ambulance software also allows paramedics to pre-register a patient en route to the hospital, so that tests, treatments, and surgeries can be prepared for the patient's arrival.</p><p>To see what that process looks like, I changed into scrubs and a hairnet and visited the hospital's surgery ward. Rita Beljuskina, a nurse anesthetist, led me through a wide hallway lined with steel doors leading to the eighteen operating theatres. Screens above us showed eighteen columns, each marked out with twenty-four hours. Surgeons book their patients into the queue, Beljuskina explained, along with urgency levels and any machinery or personnel they might need. An on-call anesthesiologist schedules them in order to optimize the theatres and the equipment.</p><p>\"Let me show you how,\" Beljuskina said, and led me into a room filled with medical equipment and a computer in the corner. She logged on with her own I.D. If she were to glance at any patient's data, she explained, the access would be tagged to her name, and she would get a call inquiring why it was necessary. The system also scans for drug interactions, so if your otolaryngologist prescribes something that clashes with the pills your cardiologist told you to take, the computer will put up a red flag.</p><p>The putative grandfather of Estonia's digital platform is Tarvi Martens, an enigmatic systems architect who today oversees the country's digital-voting program from a stone building in the center of Tallinn's Old Town. I went to visit him one morning, and was shown into a stateroom with a long conference table and French windows that looked out on the trees. Martens was standing at one window, with his back to me, commander style. For a few moments, he stayed that way; then he whirled around and addressed a timid greeting to the buttons of my shirt.</p><p>Martens was wearing a red flannel button-down, baggy jeans, black socks, and the sort of sandals that are sold at drugstores. He had gray stubble, and his hair was stuck down on his forehead in a manner that was somehow both rumpled and flat. This was the busiest time of the year, he said, with the fall election looming. He appeared to run largely on caffeine and nicotine; when he put down a mug of hot coffee, his fingers shook.</p><p>For decades, he pointed out, digital technology has been one of Estonia's first recourses for public ailments. A state project in 1970 used computerized data matching to help singles find soul mates, \"for the good of the people's economy.\" In 1997, the government began looking into newer forms of digital documents as a supplement.</p><p>\"They were talking about chip-equipped bar codes or something,\" Martens told me, breaking into a nerdy snicker-giggle. \"Totally ridiculous.\" He had been doing work in cybernetics and security as a private-sector contractor, and had an idea. When the cards were released, in 2002, Martens became convinced that they should be both mandatory and cheap.</p><p>\"Finland started two years earlier with an I.D. card, but it's still a sad story,\" he said. \"Nobody uses it, because they put a hefty price tag on the card, and it's a voluntary document. We sold it for ten euros at first, and what happened? Banks and application providers would say, 'Why should I support this card? Nobody has it.' It was a dead end.\" In what may have been the seminal insight of twenty-first-century Estonia, Martens realized that whoever offered the most ubiquitous and secure platform would run the country's digital future-and that it should be an elected leadership, not profit-seeking Big Tech. \"The only thing was to push this card to the people, without them knowing what to do with it, and then say, 'Now people have a card. Let's start some applications,'\u00a0\" he said.</p><p>The first \"killer application\" for the I.D.-card-based system was the one that Martens still works on: i-voting, or casting a secure ballot from your computer. Before the first i-voting period, in 2005, only five thousand people had used their card for anything. More than nine thousand cast an i-vote in that election, however-only two per cent of voters, but proof that online voting was attracting users-and the numbers rose from there. As of 2014, a third of all votes have been cast online.</p><p>That year, seven Western researchers published a study of the i-voting system which concluded that it had \"serious architectural limitations and procedural gaps.\" Using an open-source edition of the voting software, the researchers approximated a version of the i-voting setup in their lab and found that it was possible to introduce malware. They were not convinced that the servers were entirely secure, either.</p><p>Martens insisted that the study was \"ridiculous.\" The researchers, he said, gathered data with \"a lot of assumptions,\" and misunderstood the safeguards in Estonia's system. You needed both the passwords and the hardware (the chip in your I.D. card or, in the newer \"mobile I.D.\" system, the SIM card in your phone) to log in, blocking most paths of sabotage. Estonian trust was its own safeguard, too, he told me. Earlier this fall, when a Czech research team found a vulnerability in the physical chips used in many I.D. cards, Siim Sikkut, the Estonian C.I.O., e-mailed me the finding. His office announced the vulnerability, and the cards were locked for a time. When Sikkut held a small press conference, reporters peppered him with questions: What did the government gain from disclosing the vulnerability? How disastrous was it?</p><p>Sikkut looked bemused. Many upgrades to phones and computers resolve vulnerabilities that have never even been publicly acknowledged, he said-and think how much data we entrust to those devices. (\"There is no government that knows more about you than Google or Facebook,\" Taavi Kotka says dryly.) In any case, the transparency seemed to yield a return; a poll conducted after the chip flaw was announced found that trust in the system had fallen by just three per cent.</p><p>From time to time, Russian military jets patrolling Estonia's western border switch off their G.P.S. transponders and drift into the country's airspace. What follows is as practiced as a pas de deux at the Bolshoi. NATO troops on the ground scramble an escort. Estonia calls up the Russian Ambassador to complain; Russia cites an obscure error. The dance lets both parties show that they're alert, and have not forgotten the history of place.</p><p>Since the eleventh century, Estonian land has been conquered by Russia five times. Yet the country has always been an awkward child of empire, partly owing to its proximity to other powers (and their airwaves) and partly because the Estonian language, which belongs to the same distinct Uralic family as Hungarian and Finnish, is incomprehensible to everyone else. Plus, the greatest threat, these days, may not be physical at all. In 2007, a Russian cyberattack on Estonia sent everything from the banks to the media into chaos. Estonians today see it as the defining event of their recent history.</p><p>The chief outgrowth of the attack is the NATO Co\u00f6perative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, a think tank and training facility. It's on a military base that once housed the Soviet Army. You enter through a gatehouse with gray walls and a pane of mirrored one-way glass.</p><p>\"Document, please!\" the mirror boomed at me when I arrived one morning. I slid my passport through on a tray. The mirror was silent for two full minutes, and I backed into a plastic chair.</p><p>\"You have to wait here!\" the mirror boomed back.</p><p>Some minutes later, a friendly staffer appeared at the inner doorway and escorted me across a quadrangle trimmed with NATO-member flags and birch trees just fading to gold. Inside a gray stone building, another mirror instructed me to stow my goods and to don a badge. Upstairs, the center's director, Merle Maigre, formerly the national-security adviser to the Estonian President, said that the center's goal was to guide other NATO nations toward vigilance.</p><p>\"This country is located-just where it is,\" she said, when I asked about Russia. Since starting, in 2008, the center has done research on digital forensics, cyber-defense strategy, and similar topics. (It publishes the \"Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\" and organizes a yearly research conference.) But it is best known for its training simulations: an eight-hundred-person cyber \"live-fire\" exercise called Locked Shields was run this year alongside CYBRID, an exercise for defense ministers of the E.U. \"This included aspects such as fake news and social media,\" Maigre said.</p><p>Not all of Estonia's digital leadership in the region is as openly rehearsed. Its experts have consulted on Georgia's efforts to set up its own digital registry. Estonia is also building data partnerships with Finland, and trying to export its methods elsewhere across the E.U. \"The vision is that I will go to Greece, to a doctor, and be able to get everything,\" Toomas Ilves explains. Sandra Roosna, a member of Estonia's E-Governance Academy and the author of the book \"eGovernance in Practice,\" says, \"I think we need to give the European Union two years to do cross-border transactions and to recognize each other digitally.\" Even now, though, the Estonian platform has been adopted by nations as disparate as Moldova and Panama. \"It's very popular in countries that want-and not all do-transparency against corruption,\" Ilves says.</p><p>Beyond X-Road, the backbone of Estonia's digital security is a blockchain technology called K.S.I. A blockchain is like the digital version of a scarf knitted by your grandmother. She uses one ball of yarn, and the result is continuous. Each stitch depends on the one just before it. It's impossible to remove part of the fabric, or to substitute a swatch, without leaving some trace: a few telling knots, or a change in the knit.</p><p>In a blockchain system, too, every line is contingent on what came before it. Any breach of the weave leaves a trace, and trying to cover your tracks leaves a trace, too. \"Our No. 1 marketing pitch is Mr. Snowden,\" Martin Ruubel, the president of Guardtime, the Estonian company that developed K.S.I., told me. (The company's biggest customer group is now the U.S. military.) Popular anxiety tends to focus on data security-who can see my information?-but bits of personal information are rarely truly compromising. The larger threat is data integrity: whether what looks secure has been changed. (It doesn't really matter who knows what your blood type is, but if someone switches it in a confidential record your next trip to the emergency room could be lethal.) The average time until discovery of a data breach is two hundred and five days, which is a huge problem if there's no stable point of reference. \"In the Estonian system, you don't have paper originals,\" Ruubel said. \"The question is: Do I know about this problem, and how quickly can I react?\"</p><p>The blockchain makes every footprint immediately noticeable, regardless of the source. (Ruubel says that there is no possibility of a back door.) To guard secrets, K.S.I. is also able to protect information without \"seeing\" the information itself. But, to deal with a full-scale cyberattack, other safeguards now exist. Earlier this year, the Estonian government created a server closet in Luxembourg, with a backup of its systems. A \"data embassy\" like this one is built on the same body of international law as a physical embassy, so that the servers and their data are Estonian \"soil.\" If Tallinn is compromised, whether digitally or physically, Estonia's locus of control will shift to such mirror sites abroad.</p><p>\"If Russia comes-not when-and if our systems shut down, we will have copies,\" Piret Hirv, a ministerial adviser, told me. In the event of a sudden invasion, Estonia's elected leaders might scatter as necessary. Then, from cars leaving the capital, from hotel rooms, from seat 3A at thirty thousand feet, they will open their laptops, log into Luxembourg, and-with digital signatures to execute orders and a suite of tamper-resistant services linking global citizens to their government-continue running their country, with no interruption, from the cloud.</p><p>The history of nationhood is a history of boundaries marked on land. When, in the fourteenth century, peace arrived after bloodshed among the peoples of Mexico's eastern altiplano, the first task of the Tlaxcaltecs was to set the borders of their territory. In 1813, Ernst Moritz Arndt, a German nationalist poet before there was a Germany to be nationalistic about, embraced the idea of a \"Vaterland\" of shared history: \"Which is the German's fatherland?\u00a0/\u00a0So tell me now at last the land!-\u00a0/\u00a0As far's the German's accent rings\u00a0/\u00a0And hymns to God in heaven sings.\"</p><p>Today, the old fatuities of the nation-state are showing signs of crisis. Formerly imperialist powers have withered into nationalism (as in Brexit) and separatism (Scotland, Catalonia). New powers, such as the Islamic State, have redefined nationhood by ideological acculturation. It is possible to imagine a future in which nationality is determined not so much by where you live as by what you log on to.</p><p>Estonia currently holds the presidency of the European Union Council-a bureaucratic role that mostly entails chairing meetings. (The presidency rotates every six months; in January, it will go to Bulgaria.) This meant that the autumn's E.U. Digital Summit was held in Tallinn, a convergence of audience and expertise not lost on Estonia's leaders. One September morning, a car pulled up in front of the Tallinn Creative Hub, a former power station, and Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, stepped out. She is the country's first female President, and its youngest. Tall and lanky, with chestnut hair in a pixie cut, she wore an asymmetrical dress of Estonian blue and machine gray. Kaljulaid took office last fall, after Estonia's Presidential election yielded no majority winner; parliamentary representatives of all parties plucked her out of deep government as a consensus candidate whom they could all support. She had previously been an E.U. auditor.</p><p>\"I am President to a digital society,\" she declared in her address. The leaders of Europe were arrayed in folding chairs, with Angela Merkel, in front, slumped wearily in a red leather jacket. \"Simple people suffer in the hands of heavy bureaucracies,\" Kaljulaid told them. \"We must go for inclusiveness, not high end. And we must go for reliability, not complex.\"</p><p>Kaljulaid urged the leaders to consider a transient population. Theresa May had told her people, after Brexit, \"If you believe you're a citizen of the world, you're a citizen of nowhere.\" With May in the audience, Kaljulaid staked out the opposite view. \"Our citizens will be global soon,\" she said. \"We have to fly like bees from flower to flower to gather those taxes from citizens working in the morning in France, in the evening in the U.K., living half a year in Estonia and then going to Australia.\" Citizens had to remain connected, she said, as the French President, Emmanuel Macron, began nodding vigorously and whispering to an associate. When Kaljulaid finished, Merkel came up to the podium.</p><p>\"You're so much further than we are,\" she said. Later, the E.U. member states announced an agreement to work toward digital government and, as the Estonian Prime Minister put it in a statement, \"rethink our entire labor market.\"</p><p>Before leaving Tallinn, I booked a meeting with Marten Kaevats, Estonia's national digital adviser. We arranged to meet at a caf\u00e9 near the water, but it was closed for a private event. Kaevats looked unperturbed. \"Let's go somewhere beautiful!\" he said. He led me to an enormous terraced concrete platform blotched with graffiti and weeds.</p><p>We climbed a staircase to the second level, as if to a Mayan plateau. Kaevats, who is in his thirties, wore black basketball sneakers, navy trousers, a pin-striped jacket from a different suit, and a white shirt, untucked. The fancy dress was for the digital summit. \"I have to introduce the President of Estonia,\" he said merrily, crabbing a hand through his strawberry-blond hair, which stuck out in several directions. \"I don't know what to say!\" He fished a box of Marlboro Reds out of his pocket and tented into himself, twitching a lighter.</p><p>It was a cloudless morning. Rounded bits of gravel in the concrete caught a glare. The structure was bare and weather-beaten, and we sat on a ledge above a drop facing the harbor. The Soviets built this \"Linnahall,\" originally as a multipurpose venue for sailing-related sports of the Moscow Summer Olympics. It has fallen into disrepair, but there are plans for renovation soon.</p><p>For the past year, Kaevats's main pursuit has been self-driving cars. \"It basically embeds all the difficult questions of the digital age: privacy, data, safety-everything,\" he said. It's also an idea accessible to the man and woman (literally) in the street, whose involvement in regulatory standards he wants to encourage. \"What's difficult is the ethical and emotional side,\" he said. \"It's about values. What do we want? Where are the borders? Where are the red lines? These cannot be decisions made only by specialists.\"</p><p>To support that future, he has plumbed the past. Estonian folklore includes a creature known as the kratt: an assembly of random objects that the Devil will bring to life for you, in exchange for a drop of blood offered at the conjunction of five roads. The Devil gives the kratt a soul, making it the slave of its creator.</p><p>\"Each and every Estonian, even children, understands this character,\" Kaevats said. His office now speaks of kratt instead of robots and algorithms, and has been using the word to define a new, important nuance in Estonian law. \"Basically, a kratt is a robot with representative rights,\" he explained. \"The idea that an algorithm can buy and sell services on your behalf is a conceptual upgrade.\" In the U.S., where we lack such a distinction, it's a matter of dispute whether, for instance, Facebook is responsible for algorithmic sales to Russian forces of misinformation. #KrattLaw-Estonia's digital shorthand for a new category of legal entity comprising A.I., algorithms, and robots-will make it possible to hold accountable whoever gave a drop of blood.</p><p>\"In the U.S. recently, smart toasters and Teddy bears were used to attack Web sites,\" Kaevats said. \"Toasters should not be making attacks!\" He squatted and emptied a pocket onto the ledge: cigarettes, lighter, a phone. \"Wherever there's a smart device, around it there are other smart devices,\" he said, arranging the items on the concrete. \"This smart street light\"-he stood his lighter up-\"asks the self-driving car\"-he scooted his phone past it-\"\u00a0'Are you O.K.? Is everything O.K. with you?'\u00a0\" The Marlboro box became a building whose appliances made checks of their own, scanning one another for physical and blockchain breaches. Such checks, device to device, have a distributed effect. To commandeer a self-driving car on a street, a saboteur would, in theory, also have to hack every street lamp and smart toaster that it passed. This \"mesh network\" of devices, Kaevats said, will roll out starting in 2018.</p><p>Is everything O.K. with you? It's hard to hear about Estonians' vision for the robots without thinking of the people they're blood-sworn to serve. I stayed with Kaevats on the Linnahall for more than an hour. He lit several cigarettes, and talked excitedly of \"building a digital society.\" It struck me then how long it had been since anyone in America had spoken of society-building of any kind. It was as if, in the nineties, Estonia and the U.S. had approached a fork in the road to a digital future, and the U.S. had taken one path-personalization, anonymity, information privatization, and competitive efficiency-while Estonia had taken the other. Two decades on, these roads have led to distinct places, not just in digital culture but in public life as well.</p><p>Kaevats admitted that he didn't start out as a techie for the state. He used to be a protester, advocating cycling rights. It had been dispiriting work. \"I felt as if I was constantly beating my head against a big concrete wall,\" he said. After eight years, he began to resent the person he'd become: angry, distrustful, and negative, with few victories to show.</p><p>\"My friends and I made a conscious decision then to say 'Yes' and not 'No'-to be proactive rather than destructive,\" he explained. He started community organizing (\"analog, not digital\") and went to school for architecture, with an eye to structural change through urban planning. \"I did that for ten years,\" Kaevats said. Then he found architecture, too, frustrating and slow. The more he learned of Estonia's digital endeavors, the more excited he became. And so he did what seemed the only thing to do: he joined his old foe, the government of Estonia.</p><p>Kaevats told me it irked him that so many Westerners saw his country as a tech haven. He thought they were missing the point. \"This enthusiasm and optimism around technology is like a value of its own,\" he complained. \"This gadgetry that I've been ranting about? This is not important.\" He threw up his hands, scattering ash. \"It's about the mind-set. It's about the culture. It's about the human relations-what it enables us to do.\"</p><p>Seagulls riding the surf breeze screeched. I asked Kaevats what he saw when he looked at the U.S. Two things, he said. First, a technical mess. Data architecture was too centralized. Citizens didn't control their own data; it was sold, instead, by brokers. Basic security was lax. \"For example, I can tell you my I.D. number-I don't fucking care,\" he said. \"You have a Social Security number, which is, like, a big secret.\" He laughed. \"This does not work!\" The U.S. had backward notions of protection, he said, and the result was a bigger problem: a systemic loss of community and trust. \"Snowden things and whatnot have done a lot of damage. But they have also proved that these fears are justified.</p><p>\"To regain this trust takes quite a lot of time,\" he went on. \"There also needs to be a vision from the political side. It needs to be there always-a policy, not politics. But the politicians need to live it, because, in today's world, everything will be public at some point.\"</p><p>We gazed out across the blinding sea. It was nearly midday, and the morning shadows were shrinking to islands at our feet. Kaevats studied his basketball sneakers for a moment, narrowed his eyes under his crown of spiky hair, and lifted his burning cigarette with a smile. \"You need to constantly be who you are,\" he said.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1217_32</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R7H-RTV1-DYWH-90X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

And with this new industry as a whole slated to pull in $3 billion in just a few short years, investors can't ignore the esports boom any longer.\u00a0 Mentioned in today's commentary includes:\u00a0Formula One Group(NASDAQ:FWONA),The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.(NYSE:GS),Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Facebook, Inc.(NASDAQ:FB),Porsche Automobil Holding SE(OTCPK:POAHY).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Teams are already selling for tens of millions of dollars...and the stars of this sports niche are earning a cool million every month. That's more than the top MLB players.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the new reality of sports, and it's fueled by young, internet savvy enthusiasts who spend a collective 355 billion hours watching their favorite players.\u00a0 And this overlooked industry is only getting bigger.</p><p>In fact, according to Goldman Sachs, it's set to grow 240% percent by 2022. And one little-known company with a market cap of only $10 million is quickly becoming the talk of the town thanks to its strategic acquisitions and partnerships with some of the biggest names in the space.</p><p>The little-known company is Millennial Esports (GAME,MLLLF), and it's positioning itself to take on every bit of this playing field, including the upside--and the upside to the upside.</p><p>5 Reasons to keep a close eye right now on this digital trend:</p><p>#1 Sports, Redefined and Ready To Hit $3 Billion</p><p>By next year, tech consulting firm Activate forecasts that 70 million people will watch a single esports final. And by 2021, esports in the U.S. is set to have 141 million viewers, beating out every single U.S. sport except the NFL.</p><p>This is the fastest rise of any industry to date. One out of every three 18-25-year-old spends more than an hour a day playing video games. Last year, 250 million played Fortnite alone. Already in Q4 2018, it boasted 400 million viewers, with total e-sports revenues reaching $870 million. As 2019 comes to a close, e-sports is set to come in with $1.1 billion in revenue.</p><p>According to an in depth report on the esports industry by\u00a0Goldman Sachs\u00a0(NYSE:GS), by 2022, theglobal esports\u00a0market is expected to triple, hitting the $3-billion mark. A 240% rise in just 3 years.</p><p>Goldman also mentions that the total esports audience on streaming platforms YouTube and Twitch has already surpassed that of HBO, Netflix and ESPN combined, with viewers spending a collective 355 billion minutes on Twitch alone.</p><p>It's anything but a passing fad. It's global in scale, and major universities are even offering esports scholarships. What's pushing all this profitability?</p><p>It's simple:\u00a0Esports viewers want to be able to watch their favorite teams, players and tournaments on any screen, at any time. That's exactly where Millennial Esports (GAME, MLLLF) comes into play.</p><p>There are multiple billion-dollar prize pools, and Millennial is jumping into all of them:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Branding Media rights Advertising Sponsorship Big Data Game development</emphasis></p><p>#2 The Formula (One) for Success</p><p>When it comes to game developing and the holy grail of branding, Millennial (TGAME,MLLLF)\u00a0is on full throttle. \u00a0The news flow on Millennial's game development is moving faster than an F1 race, and the brands behind the name are top of the line.</p><p>The company has acquired Eden, a video racing game developer linked to theFormula One(NASDAQ:FWONA) \u00a0brand. Eden justrolled out Gear Club Unlimited 2 in 2018, and more games are in the pipeline. It also just securedexclusive partnershipswithPorsche(OTCMKTS:POAHY) and Nintendo.</p><p>Published by Microids and developed by Millennial Esports' gaming studio Eden Games, Gear.Club Unlimited 2 Porsche Edition will bring virtual versions of iconic Porsche vehicles into the hands of Nintendo Switch gamers.</p><p>Eden Games founder, David Nadal noted, \"When we first launched Gear.Club on the Nintendo platform 2017 we were thrilled with the reaction from gamers. We already had an amazing collection of cars from some of the biggest manufacturers in the world, but to now work with Porsche is a great addition.\"</p><p>Now with the Formula One link, Millennial is eying even bigger prizes. The F1 isn't just a race, it's an obsession. Its 12 teams are worth over $4 billion, and each race is watched by over 100 million viewers. Millennial will be rolling out these big-name brands for its major esports event,World's Fastest Gamer,\u00a0which offers the biggest prize in esports racing history. It pits big-name racers against the best of the gaming world for a killer cash prize of $1 million for the winner.</p><p>Nearly57 million people\u00a0are expected to view this year's Season 2 event, which could bring in $15 million in media value alone, with Aston Martin playing a key role and former F1 and Indy 500 racers behind the e-wheel. That includes former F1 Ferrari driver Rubens Barichello and 2x Indy champ Juan Pablo Montoya.</p><p>Once the flags are waved on this race, it will be full speed ahead for Millennial's exposure. By the time these drivers hit the $1-million finish line, Millennial hopes to have established itself as the world's biggest esports racing brand. But it will also have delivered a much bigger message at the finish line ...</p><p>Millennial (GAME,MLLLF) could be on track to become the biggest provider of esports data analytics for big tech.</p><p>#3 Big Data, Even Bigger Upside</p><p>The nearly $200-billion Big Data industry is the massively lucrative difference between esports and an esports empire.</p><p>Big Data is the kingmaker for every segment of industry. That's how companies likeGoogle(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB) have carved out their positions among some of the most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>Facebook, for its part, collects a shocking amount of data from its 2.4 billion users which it uses to fine-tune its potential to target those same users with curated advertisements. In fact, as of early 2019, Facebook has an average of over 52,000 unique data points on each of its users. Though Facebook has come under fire from less-than tech-savvy regulators, the company has shown no signs of slowing, with its share price growing by 22 percent this year alone.</p><p>AndGoogleis even more shocking. The internet giant knows everything its users have ever searched for and everywhere they have been, both in the real world and online. It has so much data, actually, that if a person were to download their file, it would add up tomillionsof Word documents.</p><p>Now the same thing is happening in the gaming industry. It's great to develop one of the hottest new games, but the real upside is when you can harness all the data you collect from millions of players and turn it into premium analytics that everyone wants.</p><p>That's exactly what Millennial (GAME,MLLLF) is doing through a well-timed acquisition ofStream Hatchet, a data-collection and processing service, which could be described as the \"Nielsen of Gaming\".</p><p>Stream Hatchet collects analytics on esports, specifically, and then helps its clients identify influences and trends in the industry. This is where the esports industry gets intelligent.</p><p>The way to make money in this industry is to know what gamers are doing, how many hours they're doing it for, what's influencing them and how to harness that data. Now gathering this data is under the Millennial umbrella. And it isn't only hitching a ride on the next generation of revenue stream ...</p><p>Companies are actually buying their own data back from Millennial. So that's double the upside.</p><p>Big data gets even bigger for Millennial, too. It has working relationships with everyone from the biggest streaming companies, social media sites and game platforms on the collection end, and the world's biggest developers, publishers and studios on the development end.</p><p>It's cornering the market on esports and gaming data, which means it's essentially holding a secret key to industry revenue. That means it's also got a secret code book for monetizing data through licensing and reporting fees.</p><p>#4 The Godfather of Esports</p><p>It helps when a company has the \"Godfather\" of racing esports at the helm. Millennial's CEO is exactly that: Darren Cox masterminded the World's Fastest Gamer event, and he's also the former Global Motorsport Director for Nissan, managing global sales and marketing for the brand.</p><p>What Millennial (GAME,MLLLF) is doing straddles a series of multi-billion-dollar worlds, from racing and game development to branding, advertising and big data. Cox has done it all.</p><p>He's landed F1 Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello for Millennial, along with Indy 500 champion Juan Pablo Montoya.\u00a0He's an expert in branding. He's even managed to turn gamers into professional racers at the GT Academy. He is THE name in esports.</p><p>He understands that this isn't just about developing games, and he's in the process of building an esports empire-and nothing less. \u00a0Cox is ready to tap into every single revenue stream connected to esports, and his string of acquisitions only adds fuel to the fire.</p><p>#5 The Value in Undervaluation</p><p>We're talking about a $10-million market cap company positioning itself to try to corner the market in racing game development, branding and big data analytics in an industry some predict will explode to $3 billion by 2022.</p><p>It's also part of a bigger gaming industry that could be worth $300 billion by 2025. The wider industry will be very interested in the big data code book held by Millennial, too. It's already an industry offering up massive cash prizes in the tens of millions, and Millennial's \"World's Fastest Gamer\" event could be the next big Fortnite-style 'World Cup' to captivate global audiences.</p><p>It started with two critical acquisitions:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0 Eden gaming, with the F1 branding and new racing games in the works</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0 StreamHatchet, with the keys to e-sports big data</p><p>The next big push will come when the flag is waved on the \"World's Fastest Gamer\" and the F1 obsession hits the digital racetrack around the world later this year. \u00a0When it comes to esports, there is no doubt the Millennial Esports (GAME,MLLLF) is in poll position.</p><p>By.

And with this new industry as a whole slated to pull in $3 billion in just a few short years, investors can't ignore the esports boom any longer.\u00a0 Mentioned in today's commentary includes:\u00a0Formula One Group(NASDAQ:FWONA),The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.(NYSE:GS),Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Facebook, Inc.(NASDAQ:FB),Porsche Automobil Holding SE(OTCPK:POAHY).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Teams are already selling for tens of millions of dollars...and the stars of this sports niche are earning a cool million every month. That's more than the top MLB players.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the new reality of sports, and it's fueled by young, internet savvy enthusiasts who spend a collective 355 billion hours watching their favorite players.\u00a0 And this overlooked industry is only getting bigger.</p><p>In fact, according to Goldman Sachs, it's set to grow 240% percent by 2022. And one little-known company with a market cap of only $10 million is quickly becoming the talk of the town thanks to its strategic acquisitions and partnerships with some of the biggest names in the space.</p><p>The little-known company is Millennial Esports (GAME,MLLLF), and it's positioning itself to take on every bit of this playing field, including the upside--and the upside to the upside.</p><p>5 Reasons to keep a close eye right now on this digital trend:</p><p>#1 Sports, Redefined and Ready To Hit $3 Billion</p><p>By next year, tech consulting firm Activate forecasts that 70 million people will watch a single esports final. And by 2021, esports in the U.S. is set to have 141 million viewers, beating out every single U.S. sport except the NFL.</p><p>This is the fastest rise of any industry to date. One out of every three 18-25-year-old spends more than an hour a day playing video games. Last year, 250 million played Fortnite alone. Already in Q4 2018, it boasted 400 million viewers, with total e-sports revenues reaching $870 million. As 2019 comes to a close, e-sports is set to come in with $1.1 billion in revenue.</p><p>According to an in depth report on the esports industry by\u00a0Goldman Sachs\u00a0(NYSE:GS), by 2022, theglobal esports\u00a0market is expected to triple, hitting the $3-billion mark. A 240% rise in just 3 years.</p><p>Goldman also mentions that the total esports audience on streaming platforms YouTube and Twitch has already surpassed that of HBO, Netflix and ESPN combined, with viewers spending a collective 355 billion minutes on Twitch alone.</p><p>It's anything but a passing fad. It's global in scale, and major universities are even offering esports scholarships. What's pushing all this profitability?</p><p>It's simple:\u00a0Esports viewers want to be able to watch their favorite teams, players and tournaments on any screen, at any time. That's exactly where Millennial Esports (GAME, MLLLF) comes into play.</p><p>There are multiple billion-dollar prize pools, and Millennial is jumping into all of them:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Branding Media rights Advertising Sponsorship Big Data Game development</emphasis></p><p>#2 The Formula (One) for Success</p><p>When it comes to game developing and the holy grail of branding, Millennial (TGAME,MLLLF)\u00a0is on full throttle. \u00a0The news flow on Millennial's game development is moving faster than an F1 race, and the brands behind the name are top of the line.</p><p>The company has acquired Eden, a video racing game developer linked to theFormula One(NASDAQ:FWONA) \u00a0brand. Eden justrolled out Gear Club Unlimited 2 in 2018, and more games are in the pipeline. It also just securedexclusive partnershipswithPorsche(OTCMKTS:POAHY) and Nintendo.</p><p>Published by Microids and developed by Millennial Esports' gaming studio Eden Games, Gear.Club Unlimited 2 Porsche Edition will bring virtual versions of iconic Porsche vehicles into the hands of Nintendo Switch gamers.</p><p>Eden Games founder, David Nadal noted, \"When we first launched Gear.Club on the Nintendo platform 2017 we were thrilled with the reaction from gamers. We already had an amazing collection of cars from some of the biggest manufacturers in the world, but to now work with Porsche is a great addition.\"</p><p>Now with the Formula One link, Millennial is eying even bigger prizes. The F1 isn't just a race, it's an obsession. Its 12 teams are worth over $4 billion, and each race is watched by over 100 million viewers. Millennial will be rolling out these big-name brands for its major esports event,World's Fastest Gamer,\u00a0which offers the biggest prize in esports racing history. It pits big-name racers against the best of the gaming world for a killer cash prize of $1 million for the winner.</p><p>Nearly57 million people\u00a0are expected to view this year's Season 2 event, which could bring in $15 million in media value alone, with Aston Martin playing a key role and former F1 and Indy 500 racers behind the e-wheel. That includes former F1 Ferrari driver Rubens Barichello and 2x Indy champ Juan Pablo Montoya.</p><p>Once the flags are waved on this race, it will be full speed ahead for Millennial's exposure. By the time these drivers hit the $1-million finish line, Millennial hopes to have established itself as the world's biggest esports racing brand. But it will also have delivered a much bigger message at the finish line ...</p><p>Millennial (GAME,MLLLF) could be on track to become the biggest provider of esports data analytics for big tech.</p><p>#3 Big Data, Even Bigger Upside</p><p>The nearly $200-billion Big Data industry is the massively lucrative difference between esports and an esports empire.</p><p>Big Data is the kingmaker for every segment of industry. That's how companies likeGoogle(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB) have carved out their positions among some of the most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>Facebook, for its part, collects a shocking amount of data from its 2.4 billion users which it uses to fine-tune its potential to target those same users with curated advertisements. In fact, as of early 2019, Facebook has an average of over 52,000 unique data points on each of its users. Though Facebook has come under fire from less-than tech-savvy regulators, the company has shown no signs of slowing, with its share price growing by 22 percent this year alone.</p><p>AndGoogleis even more shocking. The internet giant knows everything its users have ever searched for and everywhere they have been, both in the real world and online. It has so much data, actually, that if a person were to download their file, it would add up tomillionsof Word documents.</p><p>Now the same thing is happening in the gaming industry. It's great to develop one of the hottest new games, but the real upside is when you can harness all the data you collect from millions of players and turn it into premium analytics that everyone wants.</p><p>That's exactly what Millennial (GAME,MLLLF) is doing through a well-timed acquisition ofStream Hatchet, a data-collection and processing service, which could be described as the \"Nielsen of Gaming\".</p><p>Stream Hatchet collects analytics on esports, specifically, and then helps its clients identify influences and trends in the industry. This is where the esports industry gets intelligent.</p><p>The way to make money in this industry is to know what gamers are doing, how many hours they're doing it for, what's influencing them and how to harness that data. Now gathering this data is under the Millennial umbrella. And it isn't only hitching a ride on the next generation of revenue stream ...</p><p>Companies are actually buying their own data back from Millennial. So that's double the upside.</p><p>Big data gets even bigger for Millennial, too. It has working relationships with everyone from the biggest streaming companies, social media sites and game platforms on the collection end, and the world's biggest developers, publishers and studios on the development end.</p><p>It's cornering the market on esports and gaming data, which means it's essentially holding a secret key to industry revenue. That means it's also got a secret code book for monetizing data through licensing and reporting fees.</p><p>#4 The Godfather of Esports</p><p>It helps when a company has the \"Godfather\" of racing esports at the helm. Millennial's CEO is exactly that: Darren Cox masterminded the World's Fastest Gamer event, and he's also the former Global Motorsport Director for Nissan, managing global sales and marketing for the brand.</p><p>What Millennial (GAME,MLLLF) is doing straddles a series of multi-billion-dollar worlds, from racing and game development to branding, advertising and big data. Cox has done it all.</p><p>He's landed F1 Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello for Millennial, along with Indy 500 champion Juan Pablo Montoya.\u00a0He's an expert in branding. He's even managed to turn gamers into professional racers at the GT Academy. He is THE name in esports.</p><p>He understands that this isn't just about developing games, and he's in the process of building an esports empire-and nothing less. \u00a0Cox is ready to tap into every single revenue stream connected to esports, and his string of acquisitions only adds fuel to the fire.</p><p>#5 The Value in Undervaluation</p><p>We're talking about a $10-million market cap company positioning itself to try to corner the market in racing game development, branding and big data analytics in an industry some predict will explode to $3 billion by 2022.</p><p>It's also part of a bigger gaming industry that could be worth $300 billion by 2025. The wider industry will be very interested in the big data code book held by Millennial, too. It's already an industry offering up massive cash prizes in the tens of millions, and Millennial's \"World's Fastest Gamer\" event could be the next big Fortnite-style 'World Cup' to captivate global audiences.</p><p>It started with two critical acquisitions:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0 Eden gaming, with the F1 branding and new racing games in the works</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0 StreamHatchet, with the keys to e-sports big data</p><p>The next big push will come when the flag is waved on the \"World's Fastest Gamer\" and the F1 obsession hits the digital racetrack around the world later this year. \u00a0When it comes to esports, there is no doubt the Millennial Esports (GAME,MLLLF) is in poll position.</p><p>By.

A lack of regulation will lead to a culture of digital vigilantism whereby vulnerability disclosure is weaponized for commercial advantage.</p><p>Organizations will be caught unaware as their vulnerabilities are disclosed at an accelerated pace, often without knowledge or consent. They will face unachievable timeframes to fix disclosed vulnerabilities, draining internal resources. The release of exploit code, the self-propagating nature of some malware and the interconnectivity of devices could see vulnerabilities exploited faster than ever before (accelerated by developments in AI) with major impacts to business.</p><p>Software providers and organizations that rely on their products will experience disruption from strategic vulnerability disclosure by rogue competitors, organized criminal groups and hacktivists. Given the global dependence on commercial software, the weaponization of vulnerabilities will have far-reaching consequences for businesses and their customers alike.</p><p>Dealing with zero-day vulnerabilities should be business as usual for organizations.

A great power, unsurpassedin military might and technological prowess, exports its free-trade economic model throughout the globe. Borders collapse, distance shrinks and the world seems smaller. But [then] another power rises \u2014 one whose dominance is built on a system of economic nationalism and [a state-directed] industrial policy. </p><p>As [the latter] flourishes, the first stagnates, sparking a conflict that leads not only to war, but to a decade-long decline in global trade and financial assets. I'm referring of course, to the last wave of globalisation involving Great Britain and Germany, which eventually died with the first world war and the Great Depression. It was a boom that lasted nearly eight decades, during which global trade and financial openness nearly doubled. Yet as the Bank for International Settlements put it in their 2017 annual report, 'the collapse of the first wave was as remarkable as its build-up', resulting in 'an almost complete unwinding' of cross-border trade and financial flows.'So writes Rana Foroohar in the FT, adding, 'Markets did not see it coming. And at the risk of being a Cassandra, I wonder if they aren't just as oblivious to what is happening today with the US and China. The conflict between these great powers has obvious similarities to the earlier story, not just in terms of opposing economic models and rising nationalism, but also in the boom-bust timeline'. She makes a good point. Of course, today's US determination to cut China down to size is mostly one being played out in terms of a 'grand teasing apart' of the global sphere - out into a US one, and separately, to an ostracised, Russo-Chinese economic space. And it is accompanied by a radical hugging-close of technology, of a widely-defined national-security industrial sphere - with all its parts bound together, under America's dollar, energy and military hegemony. Yes, it can be called 'de-globalisation', but it is becoming more than that: It is an 'extrication' from something that was hitherto fused together - a complex rhizome structure. A pulling apart of a knotted, tangled economic and political root system. Whatever one's attitude towards globalization - good or bad - America's way of waging its MAGA war on China likely will have unintended sequelae that may well lead to some last century style pain and disruption. This is the point. It is not that Britain and Germany ended at war with each other - and to suggest that the US-China tensions it will end similarly. No. Neither is it that a long period of global trade expansion seems today suddenly to be coming to an end ('borders collapse, distance shrinks and the world seems smaller'). That might be so: but rather, it is that the hugely disruptive economic consequences described in the FT article flowed from a clear pattern of events: In the first case, Britain was determined to stop the rise of a powerful Germany (firstly, by squeezing her hard in a vice of hostile alliances; and then ultimately, crushing her, with the combined military might of Britain, Russia and the United States). In the present case, the US is wholly determined to cut China down to size: firstly, by putting China under technological and IP boycott; and secondly, by the US re-arming massively. We can recall that much of the disaster that was the German economic situation after WW1 flowed from the printing of money in Germany in order to rearm in an arms race, ahead of WW2. Secretary Pompeo, in his recent European tour, came close to giving Europeans an ultimatum: 'Include Chinese 5G technology in your state infrastructure - and you will lose having any American technology alongside it' - With us (against China), or (with China) against 'us'. Revised US foreign investment screening and export control laws, especially as applied to 'emerging and foundational technologies', ultimately will break significant linkages between the United States and China. Europe is being pressed to side with the US in this Cold Economic War against Russia and China. And in order to compel Europe in this direction, the US is prepared to split the EU, taking the East into its anti-Russia, anti-China polarization, in order to get its way. Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan of Eurasia Group argue that the first consequences of this new 'war' polarisation already are being felt: 'Tariffs are already forcing US firms to shift portions of their supply chains out of China\u2014to Southeast Asia, Latin America, and in some cases back to the US. The decoupling will accelerate as political and financial pressures drive more US production, including potentially complex final assembly, to politically safer markets. 'The countries [US and China] are parting ways. Equally important, US efforts to increase scrutiny of Chinese STEM students and workers, and to limit or reject their US visa terms and applications, will reduce the flow of creative talent into the US. Likewise, it will limit the flow back to China of engineers and entrepreneurs with US experience. This trend will disrupt the innovation talent pipeline, with unforeseen ripple effects in key technology sectors. 'Then there's the 'tech-lash': Digital regulation is mushrooming around the world as governments\u2014facing a public backlash over privacy and concerned about foreign influence operations waged over social media\u2014slap taxes on Big Tech and restrict the flow of sensitive information across borders. Brazil, India, and even California have all adopted or are considering legislation that draws on, or in some cases goes beyond, Europe's tough data protection rules. The point here is that US and Chinese supply chains and technology cooperation will continue to fragment and pull apart from each other's sphere - even were US tariff threats to recede. Tariffs are but one dimension of the American campaign to block ultimate Chinese 'primacy'. Increasingly, this (albeit economic) 'war' is now being framed in terms of American military national security. And history tells us that when national security interests predominate, they consume more and more of the economy - and governments too, intervene and control more and more. A messy, contested tech divorce will create problems for tech companies; it will raise costs (finding and establishing replacement supply lines); and will incur a growing regulatory, security and privacy compliance oversight burden, to boot. This might be manageable (just) if this war were confined to technology alone, but it is not. Trump's aim here, simply, is to force US companies to switch away from China - and to curtail China's economic prospects. The US will continue to use non-tariff barriers, investment restrictions, export 'ring-fencing', financial sanctions, and criminal indictments to achieve its aims. It will extend to energy and information too. It already has. (Recall that Britain initially tried to weaken Germany economically, by blockading food transiting through the North Sea. The US supported the blockade.) But perhaps the worry most likely to arise from past precedent will be Trump's insistence on full-spectrum, US military re-arming. He has promised to out-spend and out-innovate all rivals on a revamp of weapons systems, and is engaged in shaking the US free from all and any restrictions, stemming from earlier weapons limitation treaties. In this connection - just last week - something most significant occurred. As Gillian Tett of the FT reports: 'Beth Hammack, a senior Goldman Sachs banker, who chairs a US government advisory group known as the Treasury Bond Advisory Committee, dispatched a letter to Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary - with a bombshell at the bottom'. She continues: 'According to TBAC calculations, America will need to sell an eye-popping $12 Trillion of bonds in the coming decade. This will 'pose a unique challenge for the Treasury', Ms Hammack warned, even 'without factoring in the possibility of a recession'. In plain English', Tett continued, 'the Wall Street luminaries on the committee were asking who on earth \u2014 or in global finance \u2014 will buy this looming mountain of Treasuries?'. This - just to be clear - will be the US borrowing requirement, before even Trump raises a finger on his major upgrade of America's weapons systems. The Advisory Committee further warned that deficits typically rise 2-5% of GDP in recessions, which would translate to additional deficits of $0.5-1trn at current GDP levels; and warned too that \"these borrowing needs [would all] have to be financed in the context of already high global dollar debt exposure.\" Lest the full gravity of this message is missed, Tett adds that 'this week, one of America's biggest hedge funds privately concluded that - in five years' time - the Treasury will need to sell bonds equivalent to 25% of GDP, (up from 15 % now).' 'This level of debt has occurred just twice in the past 120 years, first during the second world war and then again during the 2008 financial crisis. The first time, the US government forced private domestic savers to buy its debt via a patriotic propaganda campaign and financial controls. The second time it relied on its central bank's balance sheet via quantitative easing [i.e. 'printing' money].' 'Because of the size of the US economy and markets it will require about a 6 per cent shift in global asset allocations' to absorb the debt, this hedge fund warned 'What if investors don't want to make that shift?'. An important question. But Trump has taken up the major military revamp banner with characteristic MAGA nationalistic bravado. And now hardly a day passes without China being described to Congress as 'the greatest long-term strategic threat' to US. The Military Industrial Complex, Congress and the Beltway - all of them have the bit between their teeth. The pork-barrel dollars will fertilise all fifty states, be sure of that, and Congressional 'eyes' are already fixed on that juicy prospect. No way this will be walked-back completely. But, back to that 'eye-popping' TBAC bombshell, it must be understood against the backdrop of the dollar share in global foreign exchange reserves falling from 70% in 1999, to about 63% at the end of 2017 - and global trade, as a share of world GDP, seeming to have peaked. China is now running a flat current account with the rest of the world. Yes, that's correct: in August, a historic event occurred: for the first time in its modern history, China's current account balance for the first half of the year, had turned into a deficit. And just to be very clear: no trade surplus - equals no Chinese financing of the US debt. They haven't anyway - for some time now. So, putting all this together: The US psychologically and politically cannot, or will not, walk-back the promised revamp of US weapons systems: 'out-spending, out-innovating' all (though some of it, in the end, inevitably may be trimmed a bit) - the 'threat' has been hyped too far, now. The die is cast. But there are no foreigners buying US Treasury debt now - after seven decades in which they have funded US deficit spending. And what then does happen when, in a short period of time, the Treasury has to sell fiat debt equivalent to 25%-30% of US GDP (possibly in mid-recession, when government expenditure automatically rises)? The US fiscal space will not just be crowded out; it will be overwhelmed. No money for the activist new intake of Democratic radicals, such as Ocasio-Cortez, to fund social projects. The strains on party unity will be obvious. But no money for 'crumbling' US domestic infrastructure, either. No money to fill the gap on under-funded pensions. Social stress will spike. Inevitably, the US Treasury's dollar printing presses will run red hot. And confidence in the dollar will sink. And it is not to be Foroohar's 'Casandra' to point to earlier experience of what may happen (did happen), when one erstwhile dominant state determines to stop the rise of a challenger - by all means available. Is it too late for Trump to pull-back, and settle just for selling China lots of Soya beans and some LNG? Probably.

Staring blankly at a computer screen, she says: \"I've seen hundreds of beheadings\".  In an effort to elaborate, she starts pointing to a blurred image on the screen. There are \"good\" and \"bad\" beheadings, she explains.\u00a0  \"Sometimes they are lucky that it's just a very sharp blade that's being used. The worst scenario is the little knife, similar to a kitchen knife, which is not that sharp. Sometimes it will last for one minute before the head is cut.\"  The woman isn't identified but we're told that she is one of the tens of thousands of Filipino workers whose job it is to filter out vile content from social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.  The scene is not from a dystopian Hollywood film but from a documentary called The Cleaners, released last year, which gives a chilling insight into the previously hidden world of \"digital sweatshops\" -- data hubs in which so-called content moderators sit at banks of computers and remove objectionable posts from the internet.\u00a0  The documentary, by German filmmakers Moritz Riesewieck and Hans Block, has been part of a growing movement to lift the lid on the gritty work done by content moderators, where low-paid workers are forced to watch and censor the worst content on the internet. It follows several anonymous workers, whose job it is to remove objectionable posts. They say they're subjected to image after image of confronting content, including murder, suicide, beheadings, child sexual abuse and terrorism, and have as little as five seconds to determine whether the image or video breaches a platform's guidelines.\u00a0  Social media moderators are just one component of the booming outsourcing industry in the Philippines. More than 1.3 million people go to work every day moderating forums, writing captions and entering data for some of the world's biggest companies. They do so in the unglamourous offices of third-party contractors in downtown Manila, far from the lush, branded campuses of tech companies in Silicon Valley.\u00a0  INQ spoke to one Filipino worker who has worked as a social media moderator for various foreign companies, including an Australian one. She did not want to identify herself for fear of losing her job. While she counts herself as one of the lucky ones to be moderating mild content, she says she is angry her country has become a dumping ground for the world's digital waste.\u00a0  \"It's just not right,\" she told INQ. \"My fellow countrymen are viewing such gruelling content every single day to make these platforms safer for other people.\"  Labour rights activists in the Philippines told INQ they are increasingly concerned about reports of extreme working conditions for social media moderators.\u00a0  \"These are images that are full of violence, full of a lot of hatred and psychologically it does something to a person. Their mental health is affected,\" says Lisa Garcia, executive director of advocacy group Foundation for Media Alternatives.\u00a0  They say the industry is ripe for exploitation given the high level of secrecy in which third party contractors operate. Workers are often made to sign confidentiality agreements that prevent them from discussing the work they do for prestigious Silicon Valley clients, whose local employees get much more handsomely compensated.\u00a0  \"You're not supposed to tell people you're working in this job,\" Garcia said. \"These big tech companies are giving such big salaries to their in-house moderators, but those working for third party contractors are not getting that much.\"  Garcia says US and Australian companies need to take responsibility for their contracted workforce in the Philippines. \"Of course these companies are here to make money. But since they are making plenty of money already they must also ensure the well-being of the people working here. The issue of mental health is very important, and that's something they need to invest in,\" she says.  It's no surprise that companies like to outsource this work. What has been dubbed \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-job-in-technology-staring-at-human-depravity-to-keep-it-off-facebook-1514398398?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">the worst job in technology</url>\" by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The </emphasis>Wall Street Journal has already attracted lawsuits in the US, where a small number of contractors operate. One lawsuit alleges Facebook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4936519-09-21-18-Scola-v-Facebook-Complaint.html#document/p3\">violated California law</url> by failing to provide thousands of content moderators with a safe workplace. It claims the moderators were exposed to murders, suicides and beheadings that were livestreamed on Facebook, and have suffered psychological trauma and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result.\u00a0  Another anonymous Facebook content moderator       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/25/facebook-moderator-underpaid-overburdened-extreme-content\">told The Guardian</url>: \"You'd go into work at 9am every morning, turn on your computer and watch someone have their head cut off. Every day, every minute, that's what you see. Heads being cut off.\"  In June, The Verge released       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa\">a series of interviews</url> with people who had worked for Cognizant in the US. Cognizant is one of the biggest third-party contractors for Facebook. In one interview, moderator Shawn Speagle said he had been traumatised by the first video he saw in the job -- a group of teenagers smashing an iguana on the ground. \"They beat the living shit out of this thing,\" he told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Verge</emphasis>. \"The iguana was screaming and crying. And they didn't stop until the thing was a bloody pulp.\"  Mark Zirnsak, a senior social justice advocate at the Uniting Church Synod of Victoria and Tasmania says that tech companies are trying to moderate content \"on the cheap\", and are \"exploiting and harming the content managers in the process\".\u00a0  He also holds grave fears that evidence of \"serious human rights violations, such as the rape, torture and sexual abuse of children\" was potentially being deleted from social media platforms without being reported to the police.  As it stands now, the law gives social media platforms -- and its third-party contractors -- the freedom to choose what sort of content is visible to its billions of users, and what sort of content should be hidden. This has triggered an inevitable debate over whether the platforms have too much say over what is removed from view.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Nicolas Suzor, an associate professor of law at Queensland University of Technology and the deputy chair of activist group Digital Rights Watch, says tech companies have an incredible degree of power over the information we see.\u00a0  \"It's a big, messy, complex system, one that relies on tens of thousands of moderators around the world trying their best to make the right decision,\" he said.\u00a0  \"Platforms have ultimate discretion over what to post. They have clauses that says we can remove any post for any reason. There's really no legal limits here that relate to constraining the ability of these companies to moderate content.\"\u00a0  One area in which free speech has been a particular focus relates to the rights of social media companies to remove terrorism- and hate speech-related content. Workers contracted out by Facebook claim they are required to remove content relating to a list of 37 terrorist organisations given to them by the US government's Homeland Security, raising further questions about just whose version of the truth is being upheld.\u00a0  Zirnsak says there is a need for governments globally to agree on regulation of multinational social media corporations. \"Otherwise these corporations get to decide what we can and cannot see and which serious crimes that happen online get investigated.\"  In the wake of the Christchurch massacre, in which a gunman live-streamed the murder of 50 people, governments have put pressure on social media companies to act swiftly to remove dangerous and violent content. But Suzor says this will put pressure on them to delete more than they should.\u00a0  \"Facebook removed that particular video in 37 minutes ... it would be really problematic to get those decisions made much faster than that,\" he said.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRK-3C61-F0NT-H0C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1336\"/><timeReceived>10:38:10 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 5, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Things are not going to be easy. The U.S. and the world have to face a number of realities, some of which I've discussed in past blogs but are worth repeating: First, China with its 1.4 billion population and obsession with technology will, in the first half of the 21st century, become the world's largest economy. The U.S. will have to deal with China as an equal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This rise of China will happen in spite of China's aging workforce.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it will happen even if, as seems likely, the statist, semiclosed Chinese economy remains behind the U.S. in terms of total factor productivity growth and creativity.</p><p>SIZE MATTERS</p><p>With a few exceptions, in building their models, economists tend to ignore such factors as a population's work habits and levels of intellectual competence. These variables are not so easy to quantify and any kind of ranking will usually offend those groups ranked at the bottom. But in my opinion, the Chinese people score right at the top in these areas. These qualities in its people will offset, in part, China's suboptimal communist state-directed economic system. Chinese emigrants, be they in Southeast Asia, the U.S., Canada or Australia, have been great success stories, often in the face of discrimination. The days of revolution and turmoil in China are now over and the Chinese can succeed in their own now-imperfect but peaceful and progress-oriented country.</p><p>I have often joked that there is an important difference between China and India. In India, a person might hate his neighbor because he is of a different religion. But not in China. There, a person might hate his neighbor because the neighbor's wife got the latest Louis Vuitton bag before his wife did. The Chinese are driven by material concerns, or at least that's how it appears to foreigners. Investors love these kinds of people.</p><p>Second, China, with its 1.4 billion population and obsession with technology, will come to rival the U.S. in terms of military power and will certainly become militarily equal to America in East Asia where it has the \"home court\" advantage. This home court advantage is important. For example, the U.S. has 12 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers. The Chinese are just now building their first combat-ready carrier. But as the press has reported, Chinese have \"carriers\" up and down the China coast. They are called airfields. And today's unsinkable superships - the U.S. carriers - like the once invincible battleships of old, are now vulnerable, this time to short-range missiles and, according to recent press reports, swarms of drones.</p><p>Third, take as a given China will seek to reassert its traditional dominance over East Asia and indeed all of Asia in general and push the U.S. out. The U.S. should not be surprised at this. Once upon a time in the 19th century, the U.S. had its Monroe Doctrine warning European powers to not interfere with the Americas. And for centuries China had demanded and received subservience from neighboring countries under the so-called tributary system. The Chinese Belt and Road 21st century \"Silk Road\" initiative, which includes building high-speed trains from China into Southeast Asia and building seaports in places like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Djibouti, should be seen in this light. And we cannot forget China's claims to almost the entire South China Sea under its socalled nine dash line geography. The Obama administration stood by while China built up bases in contested areas. Asia, especially the Philippines, noticed.</p><p>TREADWAY, Page 5</p><p>FROM PAGE 1</p><p>In the 20th century, Asians watched as the war-weary Europeans withdrew from their once enormous empires.</p><p>The empires had become a burden. Asians watched as a psychologically exhausted U.S. withdrew from its Vietnam venture. But so much of the U.S. high-tech economy is now integrated with Asia, particularly in Japan, Singapore, South Korea and China itself.</p><p>The U.S. cannot afford to just leave as it did in Vietnam.</p><p>Asia is a vital part of the U.S.</p><p>economy, not a burden.</p><p>Fourth, the Taiwan problem isn't going to just go away. Right now, because of its military inferiority vis-a-vis the U.S., China has been content to ignore Taiwan so long as the U.S. adheres to the One China policy worked out in the Nixon Administration. But China's patience on this isn't going to last forever.</p><p>For China, reunification of Taiwan is a Really Big Deal.</p><p>As some point, China is going to be tempted to force reunifi cation, by military means if necessary, as China grows militarily stronger.</p><p>From the U.S. point of view, Taiwan's reunification with China is also a Really Big Deal. Reunification could turn out to be a major economic disruption, if not a catastrophe.</p><p>Taiwan, justifiably dubbed the \"Silicon Island,\" plays an extraordinary role in the global technological ecosystem. Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm for example are fabless - they don't do their own manufacturing - and their semiconductors are designed in America but largely made in Taiwan. While the mutually ensured destruction nuclear standoff makes a full out war between China and the U.S.</p><p>unthinkable, a localized military solution to the Taiwan reunification problem might prove to be a rational solution for a China, which, in its own Asian region, had become a military equal of the U.S.</p><p>There is an additional complication with Taiwan.</p><p>The majority of people there, at least at present, apparently don't want reunification with China. Taiwan is different from Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a British colony. Taiwan is a self-governing entity, which, de facto, has functioned as an independent country.</p><p>Nobody ever asked the people of Hong Kong if they wanted reunification. There was no plebiscite or election. In Hong Kong, its citizens had a choice - stay under China or leave.</p><p>Many did leave. In Taiwan today, people can see there is a great deal of unhappiness, especially among the young of Hong Kong, with its current situation. Whether this unhappiness is justified or not is irrelevant. China had hoped that the Hong Kong model would prove attractive to Taiwan. But it has not.</p><p>Fifth, China has a long and impressive history going back thousands of years. But as I have argued in previous columns, democracy with individual and private property rights is not part of the Confucian Chinese tradition. When the U.S. took over from Britain as global hegemon in the 20th century, at least America and Britain shared the same values regarding democracy and personal and property rights.</p><p>Investors should be aware that even the top Chinese tech companies reportedly now have Communist committees inserted in their management structures. It was even proposed a few months ago that the government take equity positions in the major firms. The profit maximization model - the model in U.S. textbooks under which firms are supposed to operate - might not be Beijing's model.</p><p>The highly successful big tech companies got big and powerful before the government realized what was happening.</p><p>The government is catching up.</p><p>I'm not arguing to not buy Chinese stocks. Tech is moving fast in China, and the opportunities in the Chinese markets are just too great.</p><p>One-third of the exhibitors at the just concluded CES 2018 in Las Vegas were Chinese.</p><p>And Chinese companies are now joining the global tech market notably in places like Southeast Asia. The rest of the world is not going to share the anti-Chinese bias now being exhibited by the Trump administration. Just be aware that not all decisions taken by Chinese companies might be with profit maximization in mind.</p><p>Sixth, reinforced by the Chinese Communist one-party state, the Chinese economy is based on the Confucian East Asian model, which is highly protectionist. The U.S. is going to have to work to change this.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions for this. The U.S. can retaliate by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports and restrictions on Chinese investments in America. The U.S. and China will both be the losers if the U.S. goes down this route. The departure of arch-economic nationalist/ protectionist Steve Bannon from the centers of power is good news. But the Trump administration seems to be slowly creeping in the wrong direction and is imitating the protectionist Chinese models.</p><p>I regard as protectionist and harmful recent U.S. actions against Chinese investment here. For example, pressuring AT&amp;T to not carry Huawei cellphones just means that U.S. consumers will not be offered a cheaper alternative that is available to the rest of the world. And can anyone take seriously that there was a legitimate national defense rationale for the nixing of Alibaba's Ant deal with MoneyGram? U.S. regulators must remember that the argument that there are defense risks involved has problems. Unlike much of the past, technology is being driven by global civilian markets. Almost every tech product that was developed first for the civilian market has a military use. Policy makers have to live with this and not try to hold back the civilian markets.</p><p>THE US DEBT TO CHINA</p><p>Recently, a rumor spread that the Chinese were in the process of reducing their U.S.</p><p>Treasury position. The Chinese then denied this and the rumor was termed fake news.</p><p>Anyone familiar with international economics should have identified it immediately as fake news. Unfortunately, the majority of the global public, and even financial types who should know better, don't understand international economics. China holds approximately $3.5 trillion in foreign reserves, a substantial portion, if not the bulk, is held in U.S. Treasurys. In the popular view, the U.S. is the supplicant, borrowing from China. But reality is not quite that way. In fact, it is China and its exportoriented mercantilist policies that have turned the U.S. into its borrower.</p><p>China runs a huge trade surplus with the U.S. As a result, large amounts of dollars have flowed into the Chinese government coffers.</p><p>The Chinese have had a choice - hold the dollars or let their currency, the renminbi, rise against the dollar. So they chose to hold the dollars and keep the renminbi stable. And they had to invest the dollars someplace. Where else but in U.S. Treasury securities. If the Chinese suddenly decided not to hold dollars and not buy U.S. Treasurys, it would be up, up and away for the renminbi against the dollar. The Chinese certainly don't want that.</p><p>Peter T.

Whatsapp, a recent Facebookacquisition, managed an even more impressive wealth-to-labor ratio, with a $19 billion value and just 55 employees. Combined, both companies reach roughly one-sixth of humanity. Facebook\u2019s entertainment colleague just to the south, Netflix, crushed Blockbuster\u2019s mammoth national network of 9,000 stores and 60,000 employees with its more nimble workforce of just 3,700 employees. It\u2019s easy to see why: for just $10 a month, Netflix consumers could enjoy an unlimited video library larger than any of Blockbuster\u2019s retail shops, without ever having to find their car keys. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010. Blockbuster\u2019s fate has been duplicated many times. </p><p>The Silicon Valley economy has caused massive disruption of traditional business and business models\u2014in the process, making a relatively small cadre of brilliant engineers staggeringly wealthy. Until now, these dislocations, while profound, have been reasonably manageable. But in the years ahead, a vast new range of technological innovation\u2014from self-driving cars to robots\u2014may make the disruptions we have seen so far look tame. In this coming world, driven by innovation and powered by individual brilliance, what role will \u201cnormal\u201d employees and small-business owners have? I sought to learn how the tech elite would answer these and other questions, and how they think more broadly, by polling dozens of start-up founders and conducting interviews with a handful of notable billionaires. To my knowledge, mine is the first representative opinion poll of tech founders, thanks to connections I made during my time directing political writing for the Valley\u2019s premier tech blog, TechCrunch. At the time, TechCrunch owned an exhaustive, user-generated database of start-up founders and investors, called Crunchbase. It was an insider\u2019s source for all things tech\u2014the Wikipedia of Silicon Valley. I obtained the e-mail addresses of every founder and cofounder in the database and got many of them to answer a long battery of political and psychological questions, on everything from their thoughts on human nature to energy policy. To ensure that the sample wasn\u2019t biased by my own connections, I randomly e-mailed thousands of founders on the list. A total of 147 founders made it into my final sample. I supplemented my randomized sample with direct outreach to a few billionaires and household names in tech (such as the founder of Craigslist, Craig Newmark, who isn\u2019t a billionaire but did create one of the most widely used websites in the world). As far as the future of innovation and its impact on ordinary people, the most common answer I received in Silicon Valley was this: over the (very) long run, an increasingly greater share of economic wealth will be generated by a smaller slice of very talented or original people. Everyone else will increasingly subsist on some combination of part-time entrepreneurial \u201cgig work\u201d and government aid. The way the Valley elite see it, everyone can try to be an entrepreneur; some small percentage will achieve wild success and create enough wealth that others can live comfortably. Many tech leaders appear optimistic that this type of economy will provide the vast majority of people with unprecedented prosperity and leisure, though no one quite knows when. My aim in conducting this survey was to discover and report on the long-term economic vision of tech leaders, who are beginning to take on a broader role as public leaders. As such, I explore here two main themes. The first is the economic ideal of the elite and how their technologies shape their vision of an entrepreneurial yet unequal society. The second is Silicon Valley\u2019s uniquely pro-government political ideology and how it feeds into its solution for the displacements that automation and transformation will cause: a universal basic income. Illustrations by Walter Vasconcelos Illustrations by Walter Vasconcelos Silicon Valley has a grandfatherly reverence for its living legends, and Paul Graham is one of them. Named one of Businessweek\u2019s 25 \u201cmost influential people on the web,\u201d Graham sold his company to Yahoo in the late 1990s for the equivalent of roughly $50 million in stock (a monumental achievement at the time). He then cofounded Y Combinator, a kind of Harvard University for start-ups, which houses aspiring tech founders in an incubator program that prepares them to raise capital, build management teams, and develop companies. Y Combinator has helped start more than 900 firms, including Reddit and Airbnb. Graham\u2019s blog is highly regarded, but when he dipped his feet into the contentious inequality debate, things got awkward. Inequality is something of a taboo subject in the Valley. Rarely do I hear technologists talk about how they feel about the subject in public. Many take a pessimistic view of most of the workforce. And they fear what will happen when they build robots that can perform most jobs much better than the average human. Graham, not one to shy from the truth, decided to air these beliefs. He said that it is the job of tech to create inequality. He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve become an expert on how to increase economic inequality, and I\u2019ve spent the past decade working hard to do it. . . . You can\u2019t prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people from getting rich, and you can\u2019t do that without preventing them from starting startups.\u201d Few notable Silicon Valley figures disagreed with Graham\u2019s premise that growing inequality was inevitable and that nothing should be done to slow it down. Instead, they criticized how he wrote about the topic. \u201cYes, income inequality exists and yes, it\u2019s a natural consequence of capitalism, and other forms of government are decidedly worse than capitalism because they inefficiently create and allocate resources,\u201d agreed tech investor Mark Suster. \u201cBut the celebratory nature of today\u2019s conversation felt tone deaf.\u201d To understand whether Graham\u2019s response was representative, I added questions about inequality to my poll of tech founders. I added them late in the poll\u2019s run, so the sample size is small (about 12 to 14 founders), but because the questions produced such a clear consensus, the data are informative. I asked: In an economy where income was perfectly allocated by how much wealth each worker contributes, would this world be very equal or unequal? All respondents said that a meritocracy inherently leads to an unequal world. \u201cVery few are contributing enormous amounts to the greater good, be it by starting important companies or leading important causes,\u201d explained one founder. \u201cAn uninspired population is a stagnant population,\u201d wrote another. \u201cInequality breeds creativity and fosters motivation to change one\u2019s situation. Mass change starts with one person inspiring another.\u201d I then asked what percentage of wealth would be held by the richest people in a perfect meritocracy. Roughly eight of 12 respondents said that 50 percent or more of all income would go to the top 10 percent. This worldview is exceedingly common in Silicon Valley. Tech executives often praise so-called 10xer engineers\u2014an elite class of worker ten times more productive than average workers. That is, tech is obsessed with the highest performers within an already-selective class. The phrase is so common that in my old neighborhood, the Mission District in San Francisco, Red Bull advertises that its caffeine-laden beverage turned \u201c10xers\u201d into \u201c100xers.\u201d Understanding these frank beliefs on inequality is an important step in placing Silicon Valley\u2019s common policy solutions in context with its goals. For instance, tech founders express broad support for increased \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d for every American. When it comes to giving people of all backgrounds a better shot at working for a Google or an Apple, tech founders sound supportive. For instance, in response to a lack of ethnic and gender diversity at tech companies (all of which are about 80 percent male and about 60 percent Asian or white), the industry has directed cash toward programs that teach coding to underprivileged communities. One of the largest recipients is Code.org, an industry-wide initiative to give computer-science education to every American high schooler. But when you ask donors whether Code.org or other diversity initiatives will reverse the overall trend of growing economic inequality, they demur. At a Code.org launch event in 2013, I asked LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman what the impact would be if everyone learned coding. \u201cIt\u2019s not that everyone will have the skills for a high-performing job,\u201d he said. Instead, Hoffman claimed that mass computer literacy would help many more people make meaningful inventions that would benefit their companies and communities. But the upshot was clear: most of Silicon Valley\u2019s charitable initiatives, especially education, engineer a world of vast inequality. This fact is foundational to the high-skilled world. To paraphrase a common saying in the Valley: inequality is a feature, not a bug. Eatsa opened with a bold premise: the chain could reduce the cost of healthy food by automating its workforce. How, exactly, does information technology increase inequality? By promoting superstars. For example, 17-year-old Michael Sayman had a dream summer in Silicon Valley. While other interns around the country were busy making coffee and sorting mail, Sayman was posting selfies with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook. Sayman is a perfect example of what the economist Sherwin Rosen called the \u201csuperstar economy.\u201d Rosen\u2019s prescient 1981 paper predicted that \u201cthe phenomenon of superstars, wherein relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and dominate the activities in which they engage, seems to be increasingly important in the modern world.\u201d The theory goes that, as information technology allows employers to become immediately aware of top talent that can serve millions of people at scale, they\u2019ll all rush into a bidding war for this small slice of extraordinarily gifted people. Sayman built a viral game, 4Snaps, that snagged an impressive 500,000 users. The unexpected success helped the prescient young coder start paying family bills when he was just 13. Barely after hitting puberty, Sayman was inspired by Steve Jobs\u2019s announcement in 2010 that Apple would be opening up a novel thing called an \u201capp store,\u201d available to anyone who wanted to submit his or her own programs. Sayman\u2019s school didn\u2019t teach computer programming, so he taught himself through free online tutorials. Andrew McAfee, an MIT economist and expert in the long-term social impact of automation, describes online courses as \u201cdiamond finders\u201d\u2014platforms that enable people of great ability in unlikely places to reach their full potential. For McAfee, economic trends accelerated by Internet products leave less room for people of mediocre ability or motivation. Many industries seem to be following the superstar trend. Since the 1980s, the share of concert-ticket revenue going to the top 1 percent of artists has skyrocketed, from 26 percent to 56 percent. \u201cThe music industry is a microcosm of what is happening in the U.S. economy at large,\u201d wrote Alan Krueger, former chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, in a working paper. \u201cWe are increasingly becoming a \u2018winner-take-all economy,\u2019 a phenomenon that the music industry has long experienced.\u201d Earlier this year, I attended the high-profile opening of Eatsa, a fast-food restaurant in San Francisco\u2019s \u201cstart-up\u201d neighborhood, the South of Market (SoMa) district. Rarely does the promise of discounted food attract so many highly paid professionals. But this was no ordinary restaurant. Eatsa opened with a bold premise: the chain could radically reduce the cost of healthy food by automating most of its workforce. No humans manage the front counter. Everything is managed in a brightly lit, Apple-store-style open-floor layout, with tablet kiosks lining the walls to take orders. Bowls of fresh quinoa are deposited in futuristic cubbyholes, where translucent screens with real-time graphics tell customers when their custom-made bowls are ready. For now, a kitchen staffed with real people makes each quinoa bowl by hand, but Eatsa keeps them out of sight because it\u2019s trying to design a restaurant where customers are comfortable never interacting with another person. Eventually, Eatsa is looking to automate more and more of its staff, including cooks. The economies of the model are clear: in a neighborhood known for $20 meals, Eatsa offers lunches starting at around $7. \u201cTechnology plays an important role in improving the speed, convenience, and efficiency of our experience. By making things as efficient as possible, we can offer a great price now for a high-quality product,\u201d cofounder Scott Drummond told me. Eatsa opened not long after the city passed a new minimum-wage law, aimed especially at the service and hospitality industry. Though Drummond is careful with his words, this law doesn\u2019t concern his team as much as it does other struggling San Francisco restaurants because Eatsa doesn\u2019t employ nearly as much low-skilled labor. If Eatsa\u2019s design works, it\u2019s likely that other restaurants could license its technology to avoid the impact of minimum-wage laws. Eatsa\u2019s model represents a long-term trend in mass automation, as technology begins to shift more low-skilled workers into part-time or independent contract work\u2014what\u2019s becoming known as the \u201ccontingent\u201d workforce. Where will this increasing automation leave most people? \u201cMost of us just want a good old-fashioned industrial-era job,\u201d admits McAfee. Yet such jobs will be harder to come by, and such people will play a smaller role. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s politics are difficult to pin down. He rarely talks about them publicly but agreed to make the press rounds in 2013 while promoting his immigration-reform agenda. During a rare public interview at the famed Newseum, The Atlantic\u2019s then-editor, James Bennett, asked Zuckerberg point-blank how he identifies politically. Zuckerberg gave a less than satisfying answer: \u201cI\u2019m pro\u2013knowledge economy,\u201d he said, with a smile. Indeed, the young billionaire doesn\u2019t have easily categorizable beliefs. He\u2019s certainly a Democrat: Zuckerberg is an open and generous donor to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and a few lucky senators, such as New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker. Yet he is avidly pro\u2013free market. In a thinly veiled protest against Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in summer 2016, Zuckerberg posted to his millions of followers a rant against anti-trade and anti-immigrant populism, \u201cfearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others, for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade and, in some cases around the world, even cutting access to the Internet.\u201d Remarks like these often get Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley leaders branded as antigovernment libertarians. They\u2019re seen as fiscally conservative and socially liberal billionaires who just want to be left alone to solve the world\u2019s problems. But that doesn\u2019t explain the tech elite\u2019s politics at all. Contrary to popular opinion, most of Silicon Valley is not a libertarian ATM. The tech industry is overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2008, 83 percent of donations from the top Internet firms went to Obama, not John McCain. Many of the Valley\u2019s household names, including Google\u2019s then-chairman Eric Schmidt, personally helped Obama in both presidential campaigns. Republicans rarely get much money or talent from the Valley. And it\u2019s not just Democratic elected officials: the tech elite also support major liberal policies. Sixty-three percent of all donations from start-up founders and investors went to liberal-leaning causes. Travis Kalanick, founder of Uber, who once had a picture of Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged for his Twitter avatar, has publicly stated that he supports the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate. Google is an aggressive backer of clean-energy policy. The company withdrew support for the pro-free-market group, the American Legislative Exchange Council, after discovering that it was distributing messaging that questioned global warming. \u201cThey\u2019re just literally lying,\u201d Google\u2019s Schmidt said. \u201cMost of Silicon Valley, most of the executives, tend to be Democrats,\u201d tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, told me. Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s reputation as a haven for small-government activists isn\u2019t entirely off base: the Valley does support some staunchly libertarian ideas, and the tech elite are not typical Democrats. They don\u2019t like regulations or labor unions. For instance, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have both given hundreds of millions of dollars to charter schools and supported policies that would allow public schools to fire teachers more readily and dodge union membership. Big tech lobbyists are also strong supporters of free trade. According to Maplight, several telecommunications companies have lobbied for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that union groups and many Democrats oppose.</p><p>So what explains the rather odd mix of support for Democratic positions and hyper-capitalistic policies? What I discovered through my survey was that Silicon Valley represents an entirely new political category: not quite liberal and not quite libertarian. They make a fascinating mix of collectivists and avid capitalists. On the capitalistic side, tech founders were extraordinarily optimistic about the nature of change, especially the kind of unpredictable \u201ccreative destruction\u201d associated with free markets. Philosophically, most tech founders believe that \u201cchange over the long run is inherently positive.\u201d Or, as Hillary Clinton supporter and billionaire Reid Hoffman told me: \u201cI tend to believe that most Silicon Valley people are very much long-term optimists. . . . Could we have a bad 20 years? Absolutely. But if you\u2019re working toward progress, your future will be better than your present.\u201d That is, the tech industry\u2019s obsession with innovation is, at its core, a belief that the future gets better. Change is evolutionary. The more things change, the more companies fail\u2014and, alas, the more people get fired\u2014the more we learn how to do things better. As a corollary, they also believe that the government should be run like a business. The \u201cproblem with government orgs is they don\u2019t really have an incentive to innovate or improve processes, services, and customer experience, and they are run very inefficiently. If they were run in more of a private-market environment, like start-ups, they could have better ROI and deliver better service for all. Competition is a healthy way to encourage that,\u201d one anonymous respondent in my poll wrote. This explains Zuckerberg\u2019s and Gates\u2019s support of charter schools. Theirs is a move to make public schools more like charters\u2014a different focus from a libertarian vision of simply privatizing the education system. The tech elite want to bring the essence of free markets to all things public and private. Using traditional American political categories, this would land them in the Republican camp. But Silicon Valley philosophically diverges with libertarians and conservatives in a key way: they aren\u2019t individualists. When the libertarian icon Rand Paul began his early run for president in 2015, in San Francisco, he expected to be greeted like a hero. During the rally that I attended, Paul got rousing applause for railing against mass government spying. But when Paul asked, \u201cWho is a part of the leave-me-alone coalition?\u201d expecting to hear cheers, the room went silent. \u201cNot that many, huh?\u201d he nervously asked. Indeed, in my survey, founders displayed a strong orientation toward collectivism. Fifty-nine percent believed in a health-care mandate, compared with just 21 percent of self-identified libertarians. They also believed that the government should coerce people into making wise personal decisions, such as whether to eat healthier foods. Sixty-two percent said that individual decisions had an impact on many other people, justifying government intervention. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a businessman-turned-politician who instituted regulations on soda consumption because the adverse health effects were costing the state money, exemplified this kind of thinking. \u201cI feel [government] encouraging or even incentivizing positive behaviors is supportive, and thinking that personal decisions in health don\u2019t affect others is myopic,\u201d wrote one anonymous tech founder in my poll. That is, tech founders reject the core premise of individualism\u2014that citizens can do whatever they want, so long as they don\u2019t harm others. In the collectivist philosophy, nearly everything we do has an impact on others, justifying government involvement in many aspects of our lives. Hence, the tech industry is heavily populated by what might be called pro-capitalist collectivists. So if Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t value liberty the way libertarians do, or fairness the way liberals do, what does it value? The tech people I interviewed valued contribution above all. When Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, Walter Isaacson, asked the iconic inventor about his principal motivation, Jobs responded: \u201cJust letting each person have creative tools to fulfill his or her potential. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do here.\u201d In Silicon Valley, unearthing the latent talent of each individual is the top priority. For technologists, this means making tools that enable people to create new ideas and distribute them. For the state, this means a role as an investor, rather than as a regulator. Instead of stifling capitalism, the state accelerates the promise of capitalism by heavily funding education, welcoming high-skilled immigrants, and paying for breakthrough scientific research. But what is government\u2019s role as it concerns those who can\u2019t be entrepreneurs? As the Valley elite see it, it\u2019s to tax the wealthy\u2014and give everyone else lots of cash. A number of Silicon Valley luminaries, including Facebookcofounder Chris Hughes, have begun investigating the possibility of a government-provided universal basic income. A no-strings-attached mass cash transfer will ensure that no matter what happens in the future, everyone will have a reasonable income. Y Combinator is investing millions of its own charitable dollars in a first-of-its-kind universal basic-income experiment to see how poor residents in Oakland respond to an unconditional cash transfer. \u201cI think one of the reasons that inequality feels so unfair is that there are people really truly suffering,\u201d said Y Combinator president Sam Altman, explaining why he supports the basic income. \u201cPeople have some innate sense of what is absolutely fair: health care, enough to eat, a place to eat, things like that. If you can do that, and then give people equality of opportunity on the upside. I hope that will feel fair to people.\u201d In other words, Altman says, we shouldn\u2019t try to regulate our way to stopping the inevitable rise of inequality but instead raise the quality of life for everyone. Basic income, he believes, will allow many more people to contribute something unique to the world. \u201cI think there are new novelists who are right now driving for Uber who could contribute more to the sum output of humanity; there are great artists, there are people who just have new ideas about how to build communities that make people happy, that have nothing to do with tech or start-ups at all but are currently not able to do what they want to do,\u201d he said. How would such a massive new entitlement be paid for? Altman hasn\u2019t calculated the costs, but it comes down to more taxes\u2014taxes paid largely by the super-successful, like the innovators in Silicon Valley. \u201cYou give this money to a lot of people,\u201d he says. \u201cMost fail at whatever they do, and some are these wild outlier successes. And if you can enable a lot of people to take a swing, most will fail and some will generate incredible economic value. And, tax the fuck out of that and do more basic income.\u201d Thus, the government serves an essential purpose in not only helping people become \u201cwild outliers\u201d but ensuring that such success gets more widely shared throughout society. Over the last few decades, technology leaders and entrepreneurs have emerged as some of the most prominent figures in American life, and Silicon Valley has become a byword for innovation, brilliance, and futuristic thinking. But while millions of Americans know the most famous names and the most prominent companies, and we all use the products, the broad philosophy and long-term economic vision of Silicon Valley remain little understood. As tech leaders move to the forefront of economic and public policy, Americans should understand better how they think\u2014especially since their goals and conclusions tend to separate them from earlier generations of business leaders. In many respects, their vision represents something new. Whether it is something that Americans as a whole will embrace and support remains to be seen.

They sweep aside certain parts of the status quo, and leave other parts mysteriously untouched. They implicitly cast you as a stick-in-the-mud if you ask how much revolution someone is capable of when that person represents billions in venture capital investment. Among the most influential of these phrases is undoubtedly \"disruption\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The concept of disruption is a way for companies, the press or simply individuals to think about questions of continuity and discontinuity - what lasts and what doesn't, what is genuinely new and what is just the next version of something older. There is a lot at stake in how we think about these issues. Are the changes the tech industry brings about, or claims to bring about, fundamental transformations of how capitalism functions, or are they an extension of how it has always functioned? The answers to such questions will determine what regulatory oversight we believe is necessary or desirable, what role we think the government or unions should play in a new industry such as tech, and even how the industry and its titans ought to be discussed.</p><p>When we speak of disruption, we are usually thinking about the perils of continuity; we express the sense that continuity works fine until it doesn't. To some extent, this sense that things staying the same for too long is dangerous and makes us risk falling behind, is characteristic of modernity - not in the sense of a specific time period so much as the condition of being modern, living in a modern age. As the poet Charles Baudelaire wrote in the 19th century, when the world around him was modernising at a breakneck pace: \"The form of a city / changes faster, alas, than a mortal's heart.\" Keep living the way you're living, and soon enough you'll find yourself living in the past.</p><p>More specifically, though, disruption resonates with our experience of capitalism. Think of all the companies and products that you remember treating as seemingly permanent, inextricable fixtures of your everyday life, that nevertheless slid right out and disappeared with time. Recall, if you're of the right age, the act of respooling a cassette tape with your pinkie finger, or the phrase \"Be kind, please rewind\". Or, for a slightly younger generation, the whistles of a dial-up modem or the mastication of a floppy disk drive. Disruption tells a story that explains how things that seem as if they will last forever nevertheless come to be short-lived.</p><p>Neither those who argue for continuity nor those who are in favour of discontinuity are disinterested parties - everyone has a stake in these things. I have to include myself in this. I confess to being very wary of claims of disruption, but then again, as a professor of literature, I'm in a profession that pretty much depends on the idea that the past matters a lot and that messing with it in any meaningful sense entails spending a lot of time studying it. As Mandy Rice-Davies put it when she was told that the politician Lord Astor denied having an affair with her: \"He would say that, wouldn't he?\" And I would argue that stewardship of the past is more important than riding roughshod over it, wouldn't I?</p><p>Nonetheless, I think at least some of the rhetoric of disruption depends on actively misunderstanding and misrepresenting the past. We can call this the infomercial effect. You don't see quite so many of them today, but they were once ubiquitous, and they would follow the same template: \"Don't you hate it when,\" they would ask, and name an extremely minor problem with some mundane task you honestly couldn't say you had ever encountered. Then they'd offer their revolutionary solution to the problem they had invented about 30 seconds prior. The infomercial deliberately misinterpreted whatever it was seeking to disrupt. One of the greatest works of collective satire of the internet age are the 6,069 and counting Amazon reviews for the Hutzler 571 banana slicer, which mock exactly the mania for buzzy solutions in search of a problem - \"No more paying for those expensively sliced fruits- i can just stay at home,\" joked one user.</p><p>The reason infomercials use this template is that it taps into a pretty pervasive sense of boredom. We get excited when things get shaken up, for the big and powerful to get taken down a peg. There is a joy in seeing \"the system\" shaken up, old hierarchies up-ended, Goliaths falling to Davids. Such narratives play to our impatience with structures and situations that seem to coast on habit and inertia, and to the press's excitement about underdogs, rebels, outsiders. If you look back at coverage of Theranos, until the fateful article by John Carreyrou in the Wall Street Journal that brought the company down, few journalists really bothered to ask whether or not Theranos could do what it claimed to be able to do - they asked what would happen if it could. Disruption is high drama. The claim that \"things work the way they work because there's a certain logic to them\" is not.</p><p>                                        * * *                                      </p><p>The idea of disruption has a particularly strange backstory. Probably its oldest ancestors are Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who wrote in the Communist Manifesto that the modern capitalist world is characterised by \"constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions\", so that, as they put it, \"all that is solid melts into air\". Whereas the premodern world was defined by a few stable certainties, by centuries-old tradition, and governed by ancient habits of thought, in modernity all fixed relations \"are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify\". You can sense their giddiness, even though the situation they describe is disorienting and ultimately nightmarish. And yet they are giddy, because they feel that this accelerating cycle of constant destruction and replacement ultimately destroys itself.</p><p>This idea made its way from the Communist Manifesto into business jargon by way of the economist Joseph Schumpeter, who, in a 1942 book, coined the phrase \"creative destruction\". Although hardly a communist himself, Schumpeter derived the term from Marx and intended it to be descriptive rather than affirmative. Born in Austria in 1883, Schumpeter was steeped in both Marxian economics and in the work of classical liberal economists such as Ludwig von Mises. He became one of the great analysts of the business cycle, but also of its social ramifications. In 1932, he became a professor at Harvard. Schumpeter thought that capitalism would almost gradually lead to some kind of state socialism, a fact that he didn't exactly welcome but thought inevitable.</p><p>It's noticeable that the inevitability of socialism and the instability of capitalism are two ideas one rarely hears mentioned in connection with disruption today. If anything, disruption seems to lean in the direction of more capitalism - that is, of a more untrammelled expression of market forces. But it's important that this theory was first developed in dialogue with Marx, a philosopher who was trying to show that the capitalist mode of production made a revolution inevitable. Schumpeter agreed with Marx on two important points: that the ever-increasing efficiency of capitalist exploitation inevitably decreases rates of profit, and that decreased rate of profit leads to monopolies.</p><p>Marx thought that the falling rate of profit doomed capitalism to exploit labour ever more harshly (thus setting the stage for revolution). Schumpeter countered with the idea of creative destruction: if markets were uniform over time, Marx might well have been proven correct, but this turns out not to be the case. \"The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organisation that capitalist enterprise creates,\" wrote Schumpeter. In his view, capitalism's \"creative destruction\" - its tendency to shake up and redefine its markets - is the thing that actually accounts for its continuity. Yesterday's monopolist is suddenly one competitor among many, and, often enough goes under entirely. The cycle begins anew.</p><p>It would have been easy enough for Schumpeter to argue that in this way, creative destruction would ensure capitalism's long-term viability. But interestingly enough, in his magnum opus, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, he argues just the opposite. The second part of the book is titled Can Capitalism Survive?, and Schumpeter comes down on the side of no. After all, the constant destruction, however generative it may be from a bird's eye view, will ultimately call forth attempts to regulate capitalism. While creative destruction is viable economically, its experience is too disorienting politically to allow capitalism to survive long-term. In the end, Schumpeter believed, creative destruction makes capitalism unsustainable: gradually and peacefully (through elections and legislative action), capitalism will yield to some form of socialism.</p><p>                                        * * *                                      </p><p>Most of the discourse around disruption clearly draws on the idea of creative destruction, but it shifts it in important respects. It doesn't seem to suggest that ever-intensifying creative destruction will eventually lead to a new stability - that hyper-capitalism almost inevitably pushes us toward something beyond capitalism. Instead, disruption seems to suggest that the instability that comes with capitalism is all there is and can be - we might as well strap in for the ride. Ultimately, then, disruption is newness for people who are scared of genuine newness. Revolution for people who don't stand to gain anything by revolution.</p><p>Indeed, there is an odd tension in the concept of disruption: it suggests a thorough disrespect towards whatever existed previously, but in truth it often seeks to simply rearrange whatever exists. Disruption is possessed of a deep fealty to whatever is already given. It seeks to make it more efficient, more exciting, more something, but it never ever wants to dispense altogether with what's out there. This is why its gestures are always radical, but its effects never really upset the apple cart: Uber claims to have \"revolutionised\" the experience of hailing a cab, but really that experience has largely stayed the same. What it managed to get rid of were steady jobs, unions and anyone other than Uber making money on the whole enterprise.</p><p>The most obvious shift that has occurred in the use of the term \"creative destruction\" is that it now has an exculpatory, at times even celebratory, side. Schumpeter wasn't altogether horrified by creative destruction, but he thought it was as much of a problem as it was a functional rule for how capitalism operates. By the 90s, \"creative destruction\" had become an exonerating byword, usually when someone wanted to push back against government regulation or public opprobrium for certain business practices. Evangelists of downsizing and hostile takeovers, such as business professors Richard Nolan and David Croson, relied on the term.</p><p>While \"creative destruction\" is a deeply ambivalent phrase, the word \"disruption\" is frequently positioned as something to be explicitly celebrated. It becomes something to be taught and striven for. And where Schumpeter's view of the business cycle presumes a kind of Olympian view from above, disruption puts us in the trenches, and presumptively on the side of the attacker rather than the stalwart. While creative destruction was neutral on whether whatever was getting creatively destroyed deserved it, anything that is getting \"disrupted\" had it coming.</p><p>But there is a less obvious shift in usage. Schumpeter proposed creative destruction as a concept that applies to the business cycle. Companies dominate the market, are challenged by other companies and get displaced. But today's rhetoric of disruption frequently applies to things other than companies. This is why people such as Peter Thiel are so intent on claiming that higher education, say, or healthcare as a whole, or government, are oligopolies or even monopolies. Schumpeter would have looked at Blockbuster's gradual defeat by Netflix - a rival it never saw coming, a rival it didn't take seriously when threatened and even refused to buy when given the chance - as a textbook case of creative destruction. But is the same true for your local travel agency, record shop and pharmacist? Is it true of the postal service or the regional bus company? Disruption is a concept that draws combatants into an arena they had no sense they were entering.</p><p>The rhetoric of disruption frequently creates solidity, stability and uniformity where it doesn't exist. The disrupter portrays even the most staid cottage industry as a Death Star against which its plucky rebels have to do battle. Misperceiving, misunderstanding or simply ignoring the industry one is seeking to disrupt seems, if not necessary, then at least no impediment to disrupting it. The world is out there, stupid and driven by habits, ready to be disrupted.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote that \"forgetfulness is a property of all action\". If I could clearly see what everyone had done before me and what the consequences were, I would never act. To act decisively, Nietzsche proposed, requires a moment of egocentrism, \"drawing a limited horizon round one's self\", the power to be \"super-historical\". Disruption is premised on creative amnesia, on a productive or at least profitable disregard for details. Sometimes what comes out at the other end is a Tesla Model 3. Sometimes it's a Hutzler 571 banana slicer. The way the concept is used today is deeply suspicious of any cumulative, gradual force of progress. This despite the fact that while stories of gradual progress aren't as exciting as stories of people just flipping the game board, they often end up describing the world we live in fairly well.</p><p>Disruption depends on regarding people as participating in the business cycle who insist that they're doing no such thing. And it depends on extending the sense in which the terms \"monopoly\" or \"oligopoly\" can be applied. Did big taxi companies once dominate personal transportation, or did thousands of individual cabbies who were barely making ends meet? The term \"disruption\" makes a monolith of structures and organisations that are old, have grown up organically and are therefore pretty scattered and decentralised. Think about the peculiar alchemy involved in talking about how Google disrupted the media landscape: suddenly the hundred-billion-dollar company is a scrappy underdog and a magazine with 40 employees is a Big Bad Monopolist.</p><p>                                        * * *                                      </p><p>The final distortion the rhetoric of disruption introduces concerns where society and the state lend their support. For Schumpeter, creative destruction issued from challengers who were able to spontaneously expand or change the playing field. But what happens when disruption becomes itself institutionalised? Today's plucky rebels are funded by billionaires, can go into massive debt if they need to, are supported by regulatory bodies they or their business school buddies have long ago captured and are cheered on in their attacks by people who have been wanting to get rid of unions and regulation all along. They are hardly what we'd usually think of as outsiders.</p><p>And while it's hard to cheer on a company like Blockbuster, which acted as if the market it found would remain uniform forever, it's also strange to look at companies such as Uber and cheer them on in thinking that eventually government regulation will need to adjust to support their business models. For the ultimate upshot of the disruptor's super-historical impulse is the expectation that, rather than your idea conforming to the world in some manner, the world ought to accommodate the sheer genius of your idea.</p><p>When Elizabeth Holmes appeared on the talkshow Mad Money after the allegations against Theranos became public, she repeated a Steve Jobs-ism (an infamous free-floating quote, variants of which have been ascribed to everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to Arthur Schopenhauer): \"First they call you crazy, then they fight you, then you change the world.\" When challenged, Holmes retreated into a kind of received wisdom, but that wisdom seems to have been largely gleaned from dorm room motivational prints. Even so, there's a lot going on in that sentence.</p><p>Holmes was characteristically vague about who \"they\" were, but from context, it seems likely that the naysayers were regulatory bodies: the US Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and the Securities and Exchange Commission. So really she wasn't saying that Theranos's fictional tech was going to change the world; she was expecting the world to make Theranos's fictional tech real. She was blaming regulatory oversight for what that regulatory oversight found. She blamed the FDA's craven insistence that technology should do what you claimed it did and that people should not be told they have diseases they don't actually have.</p><p>Her hope wasn't as outlandish as it may sound; this was, after all, how it has worked in many other fields. In those fields, tech hasn't so much changed the rules as it has captured the norms by which the field is governed. And ultimately, \"disruption\" probably refers to this disruption of our judgments and categories as well. But only the disruptor has this privilege. Anytime the disruptees suggest that they might like to have the world adjusted to ensure their survival, they're told that this is a sign of their weakness and resistance to change. This double standard applies to another Silicon Valley mantra as well: do you want to \"fail better\", do you want to \"fail fast\"? Well, whether you get to, and how your failure gets interpreted, depends a great deal on who you are. </p><p>                                          Adapted from What Tech Calls Thinking: An Inquiry into the Intellectual Bedrock of Silicon Valley, which will be published by FSG Originals x Logic on 13 October                   </p><p> Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-66380913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YB-8BP1-JBNF-W2XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3099\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Will financial institutions themselves face new challenges to their business models from large, global tech firms? In short, who's going to eat who in the financial services sector, as the forces of change are unleashed by new innovations in technology? These are just some of the questions answered by an important report from the World Economic Forum, \"Beyond Fintech\", published yesterday. This is a project I've been closely involved with from its inception at a conversation in Davos, four years ago, on the need for authoritative research on the disruptive forces of innovation that will shape the future of financial services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strategic challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, which are clearly outlined by the report, have hugely important implications. These implications matter for everyone in the financial services community, from fintech startups to established financial institutions; their suppliers, regulators and, ultimately, consumers.</p><p>The report draws on interviews and workshops with hundreds of financial and technology experts. It covers a huge amount of ground but three key themes are highly relevant to all of us who work in the City today.</p><p>First, fintech innovators appear to have been less disruptive than expected because they have largely failed to change the basis for competition or to challenge incumbent financial institutions. One of the limitations for fintech innovators has been that new technology fails to create new market infrastructure unless groups come together to build a viable ecosystem. New technologies don't flourish without a supportive community. Instead, existing financial institutions have become fast followers by using the fintech innovation ecosystem as a supermarket for capabilities. The fast growth fintech space will certainly continue to thrive, not least because of the trend for regulators to open sandboxes allowing protected risktaking and even going so far as seconding staff to incubators.</p><p>Second, the biggest challenge for financial institutions is that large tech firms will attack their business. This threat is becoming more acute because big tech firms have led the way in redefining customer expectations of service. Financial institutions are therefore increasingly turning to them, as suppliers, to overhaul their own systems and raise their own customer experience in line with higher expectations, particularly in the areas of cloud computing, AI, and Big Data analytics.</p><p>While this strategy has accelerated innovation, it carries the risk that tech companies will in future make the switch from partners to competitors, offering financial services directly, leveraging their large customer data sets and strong consumer brands. However, this competition will not be head-on. This is because the tech firms are in many cases subtly redrawing the boundaries of financial services, particularly in the areas of payments and ecommerce, which makes the challenge for financial institutions harder to deal with.</p><p>And third, the global regulatory consensus that followed the global financial crisis is weakening, with distinct financial systems in China, Europe and the United States. Being successful will require the ability to adapt rapidly both to large--scale regulatory changes (such as MiFID II) while also being nimble when it comes to regional regulatory demands in emerging markets.</p><p>As the City returns from the summer break, refreshed and reenergised, the lessons to be drawn from this research for the future of our industry are important; all the more so at a time when we are experiencing breakneck speed of innovation and change across the industry.</p><p>Two implications of the research are particularly important for financial institutions that want to be the winners of the future. Incumbents must embrace change by partnering and collaborating in open ecosystems with fintechs. And they need to follow the lead of the technology firms, by designing back from the customer experience not forward from the product.</p><p>\u00a3 David Craig is president of Financial &amp; Risk at Thomson Reuters.</p><p>New technologies don't flourish without a supportive community</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-128855397</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P9N-12H1-JBVM-Y0F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 City A.M.

Japan's Nikkei posted its biggest daily gain in four weeks on Thursday after rebounding oil prices eased worries about the global economy and as a pause in the rising yen lifted exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp.REUTERS/Yuya ShinoAn important report from The World Economic Forum, 'Beyond FinTech[1],' was published recently. </p><p>This is a project I've been closely involved with from its inception at a conversation inDavos[2], four years ago, on the need for authoritative research on the disruptive forces that will shape the future of financial services.We wanted to find answers to important questions: How will innovation reshape the structure of the industry? How will financial services be experienced in the future? And what are the broader implications of these changes for the financial system as a whole? The strategic challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, which are clearly outlinedby the report, have hugely important implications. These implications matter for us as a business, for our customers and for the broader community of partners and industry collaborators we engage with as part of ouropen platform approach[3]. The report covers a huge amount of ground. My key take-aways are:FinTech innovators less disruptive than expectedFinTech[4]innovators appear to have been less disruptive than expected because they have largely failed to change the basis for competition or to challenge incumbent financial institutions. One of the limitations for FinTech innovators has been that new technology fails to create new market infrastructure unless groups come together to build a viable ecosystem. New technologies don't flourish without a supportive community. Instead, existing financial institutions have become fast followers by using the FinTech innovation ecosystem as a supermarket for capabilities. The fast growth FinTech space will certainly continue to thrive, not least because of the trend for regulators to open sandboxes allowing protected risk-taking and even going so far as seconding staff to incubators.Tech firms: Partners or competitors?The biggest challenge for financial institutions is that large tech firms will attack their business. This threat is becoming more acute because big tech firms have led the way in redefining customer expectations of service. Financial institutions are therefore increasingly turning to them, as suppliers, to overhaul their own systems and raise their own customer experience in line with higher expectations, particularly in the areas ofcloud computing[5],AI[6], andBig Data[7]analytics. While this strategy has accelerated innovation, it carries the risk that tech companies will in future make the switch from partners to competitors, offering financial services directly, leveraging their large customer data sets and strong consumer brands. However, this competition will not be head-on. This is because the tech firms are in many cases subtly redrawing the boundaries of financial services, particularly in the areas of payments and e-commerce, which makes the challenge for financial institutions harder to deal with.Adapting to regulatory changesThe global regulatory consensus that followedthe global financial crisis[8]is weakening, with distinct financial systems in China, Europe and the United States. Being successful will require the ability to adapt rapidly both to large\u2010scale regulatory changes (such asMiFID II[9]) while also being nimble when it comes to regional regulatory demands in emerging markets and sub-sectors like the payments industry. As we return from the summer break, refreshed and reenergized, the lessons to be drawn from this research for the future of our industry are important; all the more so at a time when we are experiencing breakneck speed of innovation and change across the industry.What do financial institutions need to do going forward?Two implications of the research are particularly important for financial institutions who want to be the winners of the future. Incumbents must embrace change by partnering and collaborating in open ecosystems with FinTechs.

Indeed the ANZ's group chief executive, digital, doesn't even aspire to that image.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The former boss of Google Australia prefers to see herself as a change agent in an industry that is under pressure to reinvent itself to deal with the tech tsunami that threatens the existing model of financial services here and around the globe. With increasing power in the hands of consumers, Carnegie argues that the bank model is up for grabs in the next decade. Indeed, it's a disruption that she's happy to embrace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's going to look like whatever customers want it to be,\" Carnegie tells The Deal. Extend the timeline further and she suggests that only two of the big four banks - including her own - will survive: \"If you look out beyond the next five or 10 years, it would be surprising if the Big Four construct was something that we are still talking about.\"</p><p>Carnegie was recruited by chief executive Shayne Elliott soon after he took over the job in January, 2016.</p><p>Elliott was determined to put a very different stamp on ANZ from that of his predecessor, Mike Smith, who championed a big push into Asia. Carnegie was identified as the change agent Elliott wanted after ANZ chairman David Gonski sought advice from Google on becoming more innovative. She travelled to Silicon Valley, where Google is headquartered, with the ANZ board and was named to the ANZ job in March, 2016, taking it up in July.</p><p>At ANZ she has joint financial responsibility for the Australian business, a role she shares with Fred Ohlsson, the Swedish-born former McKinsey consultant who has been with the bank since 2001. Each reports to Elliott.</p><p>Carnegie also has group responsibility for innovation, new revenue streams, data, payments, marketing and design.</p><p>It's a wide remit - and it's all about change. \"It's really partnering with Shayne and the executive committee to step-change ANZ's ability to be fit to win in the 21st century,\" Carnegie says.</p><p>Carnegie grew up in Sydney, joining US consumer goods company Proctor &amp; Gamble in 1992 soon after she finished university. She worked with the company for more than 20 years, spending time in its head office in Cincinnati and its Asia division in Singapore, before coming back to Australia in 2010 to run P&amp;G Australia.</p><p>She was recruited to run Google Australia in 2013.</p><p>Carnegie brings a fresh approach to the future of banking, focusing on the external factors shaping the industry. She compares the forces bearing down on it to the digital disruption already faced by a wide range of sectors, from media to the taxi industry.</p><p>\"If you take a step back and ask 'what is happening to industry after industry after industry?,' which now includes banking, what we are seeing is a range of consumers getting what they want,\" she says.</p><p>The trends in consumer-facing businesses involve more efficient, frictionless transactions, more personalisation of services and more transparency.</p><p>Consumers are better educated, better informed and more confident than ever before.</p><p>\"Power is shifting from government or business or not-for-profit groups or religious groups to the individual - the consumer,\" she says. \"And it is being driven largely by technology. People are still going to want to find a place for their savings, where they can access their money to buy a house or a car. What will be revolutionised is how it will be delivered.\"</p><p>Carnegie says that mobility will be a key issue for consumers. \"There is going to be an explosion in interfaces that will create a different degree of functionality around mobile,\" she says. \"Mobile doesn't necessarily just mean your phone. For me it is around mobility - whether it is a device you are wearing on your wrist or embedded behind your ear, you can talk into it and ask it to transfer, say, $100 to your mother.\"</p><p>Carnegie predicts more segmentation in banking, with some banks still trying to be all things to all people and others choosing to streamline the services they offer, possibly concentrating on servicing fewer customers more intensively.</p><p>\"Because consumers are going to start demanding more personalisation of services, banks are going to have to choose what parts of the market they are going to try to win,\" she says. \"They will become more strategically focused. They may decide to go after a certain part of the market so they can have a much deeper relationship with those customers. They may become simpler organisations' with few products and fewer systems and a much leaner and slicker back end.\"</p><p>Looking well into the future, Carnegie sees a world where the current big four banks, which have dominated Australia banking for decades, are replaced by a big two, with other banks focusing on more specific sectors of the market and a host of smaller companies offering financial services.</p><p>\"If you are talking about the big, omni-channel bank that delivers a broad range of services to the general population, there is not going to be room for four of those in Australia,\" she says. \"There will be market share going to some of the players who are already in fintech.\"</p><p>She points out that online retail giant Amazon, which set up shop in Australia last year, has already made more than $1 billion in loans in the US.</p><p>\"(Chinese e-commerce giant) Alibaba has already made billions of dollars of consumer loans,\" she says.</p><p>\"The big tech giants are already showing they are getting into financial services.\"</p><p>ANZ has already distinguished itself from the other big four banks by striking a deal in early 2016 to take Apple Pay.</p><p>\"What's going to drive successful financial companies in the future is giving the customer what they want,\" says Carnegie. \"You can cry into your milk or your beer and say I want them to love my wallet. But they love Apple's wallet. For me, [doing the deal with Apple Pay] is a statement on how we are going to conduct ourselves as a bank - a real recognition and orientation around the need to become laser focused on customer needs.\"</p><p>The deal with Apple has expanded to take in agreements with other groups, including Android Pay, Fitbit and Garmin watches.</p><p>Carnegie brings a Silicon Valley approach to restructuring conventional working patterns at ANZ away from command and control towards a more agile operation.</p><p>\"We have restructured the Australian division [along agile working lines] across all aspects of our business excluding the front line - bank branches and call centres,\" she says. \"Agile working is a distributed leadership model that comes out of the military. Agile is about having connected autonomous teams that have a high degree of flexibility and the tools to deliver on an objective, and are able to change as the context on the ground shifts underneath.\"</p><p>ANZ set up an agile working team for the implementation of Apple Pay. \"We set up a fully integrated unit,\" Carnegie says.</p><p>\"They were really clear on what they needed to deliver in terms of tech and marketing. Then we created an autonomous team and said 'Go!' They were co-located.</p><p>\"You give people a lot of freedom on how they get things done. You create objectives and then you create teams that are uniquely focused on chasing down those objectives.\"</p><p>Carnegie sees the launch of the New Payments Platform last month as providing another new way of delivering more efficient banking services into the future.</p><p>The NPP, which was set up after an investment of $1 billion by a consortium that includes all the major banks as well as the Reserve Bank, allows the instant transfer of cash between bank accounts. The platform also has the capability to attach a potentially large amount of data to the money transfer - a revolutionary step forward from just the few words that can accompany a money transfer at the moment.</p><p>Carnegie sees the NPP as a boon for small businesses: \"At the end of the day, what does small business need?</p><p>Cash flow. It's a constant problem for them. The NPP can help with their liquidity issues as it means companies can get paid instantly. But it also allows people to send rich data notifications with the money transfer - such as an invoice or a request to pay. It is much easier from an administrative point of view.\"</p><p>When she started at ANZ, Carnegie declared: \"If you aren't a tech company or you're not on the way to becoming one, you're in big trouble.\"</p><p>So how does she rate the banks now?</p><p>\"If you look at the industries that spend the most on technology, financial services is the top one,\" she says.</p><p>\"We (banks) are already tech companies. The question is, are we very good tech companies?\"</p><p>Carnegie recognises that there are big regulatory differences between banks and new tech players such as Google and Amazon that will also shape how much banks can change in the future. Since the financial crisis, banks have been subject to increasingly strict capital controls while public opinion has shaped increasingly strict consumer protection legislation.</p><p>Carnegie and other senior bank executives are also watching to see what recommendations might come out of the banking royal commission.</p><p>But she also points out that the future of banking in Australia is affected by the strength of the economy.</p><p>Australia has had more than 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth. But that could change if growth slows and interest rates rise.</p><p>\"If we see interest rates go up, we could see people have more stress with their loans. This could create a lot of noise in the financial sector,\" she says.</p><p>That could slow innovation, but it could also bring about more disruption in the industry.</p><p>Carnegie says she has not found the shift from Google to banking to be as big a cultural shock as some might think. The technical knowledge she gained from her three years running Google Australia is a key asset for her job in banking, but she says her background in marketing has probably been more important.</p><p>\"I started my career in marketing, but when I left Proctor &amp; Gamble I was running businesses,\" she says.\"The big asset I bring with me [from Google and P&amp;G] to banking is the customer understanding. If you look at both P&amp;G and Google, and what needs to happen at the ANZ, the constant is an absolute passion for innovation and an absolute passion for the customer.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180316DealNSW10000362469051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RW7-WXW1-JD3N-500P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>DealNSW Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 16, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00091HS</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001RPG</classCode><className>PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>ANZ (NZX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>ANZ (ASX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>PGP (PAR)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>PG (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DG3K</classCode><className>DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000373</classCode><className>CONSULTING SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Barr said the proposed legislation is aimed at \"requiring greater transparency and accountability when platforms remove lawful speech.\"  The legislation follows on from an executive order issued by President Trump in May targeting social media for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Trump often claims online platforms are biased against conservatives, but has provided minimal evidence backing this up.   President Trump is ramping up the pressure on social media companies.    At a White House event on Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr announced the DOJ had submitted legislation to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  \"That legislation addresses concerns about online censorship by requiring greater transparency and accountability when platforms remove lawful speech,\" Barr said.Barr did not elaborate on what powers the legislation would give the government to force tech companies to show their decision-making process for removing content.  Section 230 is the part of US law that gives internet companies the power to moderate what appears on their platform while also shielding them from legal liability for illegal content posted by users.  The legislation follows an executive order President Trump issued in May just two days after Twitter placed a fact-check on two of his tweets about mail-in voting.    The order sought to empower federal regulators to amend Section 230 and investigate allegations of anti-conservative bias against social media companies. Claiming tech firms are biased against the right-wing is a common conservative talking point, though there is scant evidence of any such bias.  Trump's order is the subject of two lawsuits that allege it infringes on users' and companies' First Amendment rights. Alongside the DOJ's proposed legislation, Trump has been trying to push the executive order through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by nominating a new commissioner to replace current Republican Commissioner Mike O'Rielly, who has voiced opposition to the order on First Amendment grounds.  President Trump also attacked Silicon Valley tech companies more generally during the event on Wednesday, saying it was his aim to protect Americans from \"censorship, cancel culture, and consumer abuses inflicted by big tech companies.\"    \"In recent years, a small group of powerful technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\" Trump said, adding that he believed tech companies have become intolerant of conservative voices on their platforms at the \"urging of the radical left.\"  Trump has previously accused Twitter, Google, and Facebook of systematically discriminating against him.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[5] The US Department of Justice will oversee Apple in the federal government's new push to ramp up antitrust enforcement over the largest tech corporations, according to Reuters. Reuters said on Monday[6]that the DOJ will have jurisdiction over Apple should the iPhone maker be investigated for antitrust violations. The move appears to be part of a coordinated effort within the federal government to divvy up oversight of the largest tech firms as criticism grows over the unprecedented power that the so-called Big Tech companies have amassed in recent years.  The DOJ and Federal Trade Commission \u2014 the two federal agencies responsible for antitrust investigations\u2014 have now sorted out jurisdiction of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, according to recent press reports, signalling a renewed effort to rein in the operations of the companies. The news came as Apple executives stood on stage during the company's annual developer's conference[7] in San Jose, California. Apple's stock dropped[8] as much as 2.4% when news of the potential probe was first announced, but has since recovered a bit. Representatives for Apple and the DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last Friday,The Journal reported[9]the DOJ is potentially preparing an antitrust probe against Google. On Saturday, theWashington Post [10]reported that the FTC would get oversight of Amazon. And earlier on Monday, it was reported[11] that the FTC would have jurisdiction over Facebook. Read more: The FTC will reportedly have oversight over a potential Facebook probe, and it could signal a tidal wave of tech antitrust action[12] Although no formal antitrust investigations have been announced, the divvying of turf amongst the DOJ and FTC appears to be the government's first step into putting the tech industries largest companies under the microscope in the search for possible monopolistic practices. Curbing these tech giant's power has been on the rise in recent political rhetoric \u2014 especially in the case of Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. In March, Warren published a Medium post, outliningher plan[13]to \"unwind\" big tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, and Google. In a subsequent interview with The Verge[14], Warren added Apple to the list of companies she would like to see broken up. Warren said that Apple has the same problem as Amazon, Facebook, and Google \u2014 it runs its App Store and sells its own apps. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store,\" she said. \"They don't get to do both at the same time.\"NOW WATCH: We compared the $200 Scuf Vantage PlayStation controller to the $25 EasySMX controller \u2014 and the winner was clear[15]See Also: Apple just

Lynn and his Open Markets program. Slaughter says that Lynn was not abiding by New America's standards of openness and institutional collegiality. He says he was fired for his staunch antitrust views on the biggest technology companies and, in specific, his praise for the EU's decision in June to levy a $2.7 billion fine on Google for unfair market practices.\u00a0</p><p>Lynn has studied monopolies for nearly 20 years (15 of them while based at New America). He is the author of two books on the subject, including Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction (2009), and numerous essays and op-eds. His work is notable for its examination not only of the economic impact of monopolies, but also of their political implications. The mission of the initiative Lynn headed at New America promises as much: The Open Markets Program at New America was founded to protect liberty and democracy in America from extreme concentrations of economic and political power. Research topics include the growth of food and farming conglomerates; the challenges posed to small businesses; and, in recent years, the growing power of Big Tech companies like Amazon and Google. Journalists and politicians had been paying a great deal of attention to this work in recent years. Massachusetts<person><nameText>senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>delivered the keynote address at an Open Markets conference about America's Monopoly Problem in June 2016, and the New York Times frequently cites the work of the Open Markets team in its reporting on the growth of Amazon. \u00a0</p><p>So when Lynn issued a press release on June 27, 2017, congratulating the European commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, for fining Google $2.7 billion, it could hardly have come as a surprise to anyone at New America. Google's market power is one of the most critical challenges for competition policymakers in the world today, Lynn wrote, and he called on U.S. regulators to build upon this important precedent, both in respect to Google and to other dominant platform monopolists including Amazon. \u00a0</p><p>Yet it was a surprise to New America's most-prominent donor, <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt, </nameText></person>the executive chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Google and Schmidt have given more than $21 million to New America in recent years, and Schmidt chaired the think tank's board for eight years. So displeased was he by Lynn's praise for the EU decision that, according to one of the current co-chairs of the board, Jonathan Soros, he asked to be removed as chairman emeritus. Days later, Lynn and his team of 10 full-time employees were out.</p><p>When a New York Times story about the ouster appeared online on August 30, <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter </nameText></person>immediately tweeted, This story is false. This was followed by another tweet a few hours later saying, Let me be clearer in an era of fake news; facts are largely right but quotes are taken way out of context and interpretation is wrong. She would later delete her first tweet.\u00a0</p><p>Coming on the heels of the August firing of engineer James Damore for challenging what he described as an ideologically liberal echo chamber at the company, this episode has seen Google do the hardest thing possible in Washington it's brought left and right together to question the company's power and generated a wave of anti-monopoly fervor.</p><p>The controversy also revives perennial questions about how think tanks operate: How do institutions that take tens of millions of dollars from corporations and wealthy individuals maintain their integrity? Can policymakers and the public trust the research that emerges? And in an age that demands transparency, in which missteps and scandals are instantly magnified thanks to social media, how can research institutions pursue both relevance and rectitude?</p><p>For two years, I received financial support $50,000 a year from New America to study and write about technology. After my fellowship ended in 2014, I was invited to continue my relationship with the foundation as an unpaid Future Tense fellow, part of a team that sponsored debates, panels, and book events on technology-related subjects in conjunction with Arizona State University and Slate. Everyone I know at New America is hardworking and intellectually curious.</p><p>Steve Coll was president when I joined the foundation, and I recall him emphasizing that as a fellow, I would face no interference with my work. I never did. The intellectual freedom and the generous money offered by New America make such fellowships deeply coveted. Giving people (mainly journalists but also independent scholars) who usually have pressing deadlines the time and space to work on more slowly developing projects is of immense value.\u00a0</p><p>I used to joke that I was a token at the think tank not because of my conservative political views (though the overwhelming majority of folks on staff at New America lean left) but because of my skepticism about the blue-skies promises made by technology companies. At Future Tense events, in my writings, and during internal New America meetings, I never once felt pressure to moderate my views; indeed, on many occasions I was encouraged to make my criticism as public as possible to balance out the rampant techno-enthusiasm of my colleagues. Other former fellows, such as Evgeny Morozov and Franklin Foer, also pursued projects during their time at New America that directly challenged the pretensions of Big Tech (a fact that Slaughter would repeatedly cite when responding to the backlash over Lynn's firing).\u00a0</p><p>After news of the Open Markets team's ouster at New America broke on August 30, I spoke to current and former fellows about what had happened. Most were shocked about how the immediate situation had been handled and despondent over what the fallout would mean for both the reputation of the institution and their own work. The next morning, I resigned my position as a Future Tense fellow.\u00a0</p><p>On September 2, a group of 25 current and former fellows sent a letter to New America's board outlining our concerns about the ouster of the Open Markets program and asking questions about Google's role at the foundation. Our point was that freedom from donor influence was indispensable to fellows' individual credibility as well as that of the institution.</p><p>Slaughter quickly moved from aggressive tweeting to damage control. She posted a defensive explanation of the firing of Lynn on the website Medium, maligning him as a colleague while claiming to be brave enough to speak the truth even though it was messy and hard. She went so far as to claim that Lynn's new organization Open Markets had quickly re-formed as an independent nonprofit called Citizens Against Monopoly was the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election, at a time when I personally think the country faces far greater challenges of racism, violence, a broken political system, and geographic and partisan divisions so great that we are losing any common sense of what we stand and strive for as a country. Faced with ethical scrutiny of her leadership, Slaughter tried to distract people by pointing to racism and violence in American society.\u00a0</p><p>There were a few positive comments made about Slaughter's Medium article, including one from New America board member James Fallows, who said it recognizes big issues and details of this case less pat than they may seem. But the overwhelming reaction was negative. It was summed up best by a commentator on the site, Democracy Expert, who posted as succinct reaction the Latin tag Res ipsa loquitur. The thing speaks for itself. \u00a0</p><p>Leading a think tank is a challenging task that marries the petty fiefdoms and grievances of academia with a constant pressure to raise money. Today's think tank president or CEO isn't merely a manager; he or she is expected to be a media-savvy public intellectual (or thought leader if you prefer Silicon Valley lingo), making regular appearances on television and in op-ed pages while cultivating a large following on social media. The pay for the job is handsome; Slaughter earns more than half a million dollars a year at New America.\u00a0</p><p><person><nameText>Eric Schmidt </nameText></person>recruited Slaughter in 2013 when he was chairman of New America's board of directors. The board wanted a higher profile for the organization, and the former dean of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, who had served as director of policy planning under Hillary Clinton at the State Department, seemed the perfect hire.\u00a0</p><p>Slaughter dropped Foundation from New America's name and exchanged the group's dowdy offices for sleeker digs, complete with a large conference room called the <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt </nameText></person>Ideas Lab. New America's annual meetings started adopting the slick optics of a TEDx conference, with speakers such as Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Flake featured alongside business leaders like Kevin Martin, a vice president at Facebook, and David Wiley, the chief academic officer of Lumen Learning. Rhetoric about how New America was tackling the problems of the Digital Age cropped up more and more frequently. New America is committed to renewing America in the Digital Age, though a combination of big ideas, technology and policy, Slaughter said in 2016, in a typical press release.\u00a0</p><p>Every Washington think tank rebrands itself every few decades and nearly every one has its share of internal Machiavellian intrigue and scandal related to funding. In 2014, the Washington Post asked Who funds the new Brookings? and outlined how the city's oldest think tank, the Brookings Institution, had pursued an aggressive money-raising strategy that included soliciting donations from corporations and foreign governments, including more than $20 million from Qatar. The New York Times also uncovered increased foreign money flowing into think tanks such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Atlantic Council. \u00a0</p><p>Ken Silverstein wrote a lengthy expos\u00e9 in the Nation in 2013 outlining the many corporate and foreign donors to the progressive Center for American Progress (founded in 2003 by John Podesta, a White House chief of staff during the Clinton administration) and asked, for example, why CAP had not disclosed the money it received from alternative-energy companies when one of its fellows was praising those companies in congressional testimony. Silverstein argued that think tanks effectively serve as unregistered lobbyists. \u00a0</p><p>The question he was really asking, however, is the one that bedevils every leader of a think tank: How do you measure influence?\u00a0</p><p>The think tank appeared in Washington in the early 20th century thanks to the largesse of a few individuals Andrew Carnegie set up the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for example, and Robert Brookings launched the Brookings Institution. These were avowedly nonpartisan and scholarly in their focus, with a mission to educate the public and the political class about a range of policy issues. Over the century, the number of think tanks grew exponentially and includes specialized groups such as the RAND Corporation and the Council on Foreign Relations as well as more political ones like the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute. And although often on opposing sides of policy debates, they operated along similar lines: churning out policy papers and serving as comfortable way stations for White House officials when their party was out of power. (These were the days before former presidents left office with lavishly funded personal foundations where they migrated with their staffs to continue to lend our wisdom, as the home page of the Obama Foundation boasts.) \u00a0</p><p>Think tanks used to have straightforward measurements of their clout: They would point to legislation that relied on their research, books published by their scholars, and commentary by their staffers in newspapers or on television. Most also employed a few key figures who didn't generate a lot of earned media, generally men and women with long tours of duty in government or the academy whose experience at the highest levels guaranteed they were people of substance.\u00a0</p><p>Today it is harder to be heard above the relentless hum of information, and there is more competition for attention and resources. As a result, think tanks have started to function more like brands than quasi-academic institutions. But the corporatization of think tanks, like the corporatization of higher education, has consequences for what those institutions produce and for how they treat the people who work for them. In higher education, corporatization has created bloated, expensive college administrations that cater to the whims of their customers (what students are called these days). In the think tank world, references to a scholar's influence on the world of ideas have given way to metrics and jargon and management-speak about deliverables and returns on investment and synergy.</p><p>Development departments within think tanks have also gained in influence; at many places, including New America, administrators sit in on discussions of scholars' work, the better to coordinate fundraising efforts. Silverstein reported that CAP fellows told him they were very clearly instructed to check with the think tank's development team before writing anything that might upset contributors. These tensions exist in think tanks regardless of where they rest on the political spectrum; the leadership meltdown at the Heritage Foundation this spring, which led to the ouster of its president, exposed serious disagreements about how politically engaged the think tank should be and how its political efforts should be funded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So why is New America receiving sudden scrutiny for what think tanks have been doing for years? Some of the outrage can be explained by the fact that even people unfamiliar with the think tank world interact with Google on a daily basis, unlike with, say, Qatar. Stories about Google's influence are international news. But it's also that tech companies like Google have become formidable powers in Washington in a short span of time pouring money into both progressive and conservative think tanks while also spending heavily on more traditional lobbying efforts focused on Capitol Hill. \u00a0</p><p>During the Obama administration, Google representatives were at the White House constantly; more than once a week, on average, from the time the president took office until October 2015, according to the Intercept, and approximately 250 people went from working for Obama to working for Google (or vice-versa). The company's lobbying efforts show no signs of abating with the Trump administration, either. As the Washington Post reported in July, Google spent the most it ever has in a single quarter trying to influence elected officials in Washington, according to lobbying disclosure forms. Companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Uber have followed suit.\u00a0</p><p>This, combined with Silicon Valley's oft-stated contempt for the slow and messy business of public-policy-making, should have people concerned even those of us who defend a free market in which businesses are allowed to pursue and defend their self-interests.\u00a0</p><p>Yet the gravest danger is not the heavy hand of Big Brother but self-censorship. You don't have to agree with a single word that Barry Lynn and his colleagues said or wrote about monopolies to understand that what happened to them at New America will have a chilling effect on the work of others and not just in think tanks.\u00a0</p><p>Google, Facebook, and the other large technology companies fund a great deal of academic research. As NPR technology reporter Aarti Shahani reported the day after the New America story broke, Yesterday, I called people whom I know get money from Google. I spoke with this one professor who was like, 'You know, there's an area of research I've thought about doing to look at the Communications Decency Act, which basically protects Google and other Internet companies from being liable for fake news and slander.' The professor's not touching it because [he] gets money from Google. The Google Transparency Project, a nonprofit organization, found more than 300 research papers published between 2005 and 2017 on public policy matters of interest to Google that were in some way funded by the company, for which Google spent many millions. Academics did not disclose the Google funding in nearly two-thirds of cases, the group reported.</p><p>On September 6, New America hosted a lengthy all-staff meeting to discuss the previous week's events the meeting was declared off-the-record, which speaks volumes itself. A few minutes before it began, Jonathan Soros emailed a letter to staffers that signaled the board's intent to stand behind Slaughter and doubled-down on her claim that it was a pattern of behavior by Barry that merited his termination and not Google's role at the institution.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The letter was oddly conspiratorial in tone. Soros claimed the press coverage of New America was the result of a targeted communications campaign and that the Open Markets team successfully seeded a sympathetic article in the New York Times. New America, he wrote, was simply collateral damage of the Open Markets team's broader challenge to Google. Although there were nods to the need for New America to explore ways to codify standards and plenty of praise for transparency, there is little evidence that, going forward, it will be anything but business as usual. And, as reported by Wired, in the all-staff meeting, Slaughter adopted Washington's favorite way to make PR problems go away: promising to form a committee to review and establish standards for interaction between donors and New America leadership. At the meeting, one of the few voices to praise Slaughter's handling of the crisis, according to Wired, was Alan Davidson, the man who launched Google's first lobbying office in Washington in 2005 and went on to serve in Obama's Commerce Department. Davidson, now a Public Interest Technology Fellow at New America, praised Slaughter and echoed her criticism of Lynn. \u00a0</p><p>There was certainly no recognition that what drove the response to the events at New America is the same thing that has brought Google increasing skepticism from both left and right: the company's unparalleled power. Google's influence has grown not just in the corner of the ideas industry that includes Washington think tanks, but broadly throughout our culture. Its power and money might lead to censorship (and self-censorship) without its ever needing to issue a directive to a think tank president.</p><p>In an ideal world, think tanks offer a place both for policy-minded scholarship and for refugees from politics, academia, and the media who might otherwise have no institutional support. At their best, they generate ideas that can improve policymaking and inform the public. But pay-for-play is a deepening ethical challenge for these institutions. \u00a0</p><p>In 2015, Washington Monthly featured a lengthy article on rethinking the think tank. In it, a pair of writers lamented the political polarization of think tanks in a hyperpartisan era and argued that a plethora of specialized research institutions funded by trade associations, corporations, and partisan donors on both right and left have led many to question the objectivity of the policy positions adopted. \u00a0</p><p>The solution proposed was a wonky restatement of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's mantra, Move fast and break things. Think tanks should embrace a minimum viable policy product in their work, the authors argued. That's a meaningful bit of jargon that adapts the hugely successful Silicon Valley concept of bringing products to market just as quickly as they can be made into semi-usable form. Spending years debating a policy problem without concrete proposals for change can alienate people. We have to be quicker to offer proposed solutions. This approach, they noted, had the added benefit of being far less susceptible to the appearance (or reality) of quid pro quo funding.</p><p>One of the writers was Ben Scott, a senior adviser at New America. The other was <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter.</nameText></person>\u00a0</p><p>What they seem not to have realized is that minimum viable products rely on early adopters to test their effectiveness and offer feedback about improvements. It's a relationship built on trust. Just like the one between think tanks and the public. If the past week's reaction to Google's role at New America is any guide, the trust is broken.\u00a0</p><p>Christine Rosen is a senior editor of the New Atlantis and a columnist for Commentary magazine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYST-1198877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PFX-17R1-JBRW-248J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">154608</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Weekly Standard</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Standard</publicationName><volume>Vol. 23</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Amid mounting concerns over the growing influence of Chinese companies and their ties to the communist government, national security experts say Washington is leveraging all of its tools to keep Chinese technology-related investments out of the U.S.  \u201cI think that the door is going to be largely shut to cutting edge Chinese investments,\u201d said Mario Mancuso, Partner at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, and former member of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. or CFIUS. \u201cU.S. business, whether it's the tech community or industry as a whole, I think they're starting to get that picture.\u201d  TikTok, known for its viral dance clips, has emerged as the latest geopolitical flash point in US-China relations. Owned by Chinese company ByteDance, the Trump Administration has repeatedly raised suspicions about the vast amounts of data collected on the platform, and Beijing\u2019s ability to access it.   The company has denied those accusations and gone to great lengths to prove its independence from its Chinese parent company, as both President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threaten to clamp down on the popular social media app.Earlier this year, it hired Formed Disney (DIS) executive Kevin Mayer to become the CEO of TikTok and COO of ByteDance. It is reportedly considering a global headquarters outside of China, and maintains that American user data is only stored on U.S. servers, with a backup in SingaporeNo \u201cguardrails\u201d to guide policyStill, anything short of a spinoff from ByteDance is unlikely to appease lawmakers and regulators suspicious about any Chinese-owned company\u2019s intentions. Theresa Payton, Former White House Chief Information Officer under President George W. Bush says the distrust extends to every Chinese company with ambitions in the U.S.  \u201cSomething has to be hammered out at the deal table between China and the United States around protection and honoring intellectual property rights, and the privacy of citizens and their data,\u201d said Paytoo. \u201cUntil that international relationship is hammered out, any Chinese hardware, software and social media apps will fall under this level of scrutiny because we don't have clarity on what the guardrails are.\u201dCFIUS has emerged as a critical check on Chinese companies looking to expand here. The Inter-agency committee tasked with reviewing national security implications of foreign investments in American companies has used its expanded scope under the Trump Administration to aggressively block transactions. In 2018, the committee blocked Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition of Moneygram over data security concerns. Last year, CFIUS ordered Beijing Kunlun Tech Co to sell popular gay dating app Grindr.  While CFIUS is tasked with reviewing all foreign transactions, Mancuso, who also served as U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce, Industry and Security, says the committee views China as a \u201ccategory of one.\u201d And it has wide latitude to determine the fate of firms, especially those invested in emerging tech.   \u201cThis is not a criminal proceeding, where the government has to prove beyond a reasonable [that a national security risk exists]. In fact, the government doesn\u2019t have to believe that anything went wrong,\u201d Mancuso said. \u201cThe government could both force an unwind and believe that no data left servers in the United States.\u201dThe growing move to clamp down on Chinese companies comes as countries around the world increasingly look to build out their digital walls. Following heightened border tensions between India and China last month, the Indian government banned 59 Chinese-owned apps including TikTok, calling them a threat to the country\u2019s sovereignty and security. That cut off access to 200 million TikTok users, a third of the app\u2019s global user base. India, is among roughly 45 countries with data localization requirements in place, mandating tech companies to store domestic user data on local servers. Samm Sacks, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, says Washington\u2019s efforts to push out Chinese companies, accelerates the move towards digital protectionism.  \u201cIt creates a blueprint to start using national security as a reason to ban market competitors. I think about places like India and Europe that have taken a really strong stance on digital sovereignty and this idea that Silicon Valley has a concentration of power and it's time to return some of that power,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cWe're sort of showing them the way, if they wanted to make a case against U.S. tech companies.\u201d  Impact to Big Tech in the U.S.That may prove to be problematic for U.S. tech giants fighting their own regulatory battles both at home and abroad. Matt Perault, Former Director of Public Policy at Facebook (FB), says foreign competition in the market helps quiet antitrust concerns expressed by regulators in the U.S. and Europe.  \u201cHaving companies quickly rise to challenge U.S. tech firms, is an important thing in terms of ensuring that U.S. tech firms continue to have the incentive to deliver better products at lower prices, and to continue to be as innovative as possible,\u201d said Perault, Director of Center on Science &amp; Technology Policy at Duke University. \u201cI think it would be a problematic thing if the U.S. market, for no reason other than sort of political concerns...all of a sudden had fewer choices and services you could use.\u201dStill, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has singled out TikTok on a number of occasions, suggesting that a crackdown on the American social media platform, would enable Chinese apps to gain in popularity, and dictate the regulatory rules.  \u201cUntil recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There\u2019s no guarantee these values will win out,\u201d he said, in an address at Georgetown University last fall, pointing to reports of TikTok censoring protestors and activists. \u201cIs that the internet we want?\u201d  Perault says the U.S. crackdown on Chinese companies and lawmaker concerns about American tech companies becoming too powerful, point to the \u201cincoherence of U.S. government policy.\u201d  \u201cRight now, political figures in the US are saying two things that are in conflict with each other. On the one hand, they're saying, we're really concerned about the increasing dominance of us tech firms, they have unchecked power, it's really problematic\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other they're saying, we're deeply concerned about Chinese products. And so, in a range of different ways we want to have a more protectionist approach to protect U.S. tech firms from competition from Chinese firms.\u201d  -Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But its financial heft \u2014 the source of nearly all its enormous profits \u2014 is advertising. And perhaps no day was more pivotal in transforming Google into a powerhouse across the entire digital advertising industry than April 13, 2007, when the company clinched a deal to buy DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.      The deal turned out to be \u201ca total game changer, a crucial piece in the larger jigsaw puzzle Google put together,\u201d said Timothy Armstrong, a former Google executive who championed the acquisition.    It has also turned out to be a classic example of why a growing number of antitrust experts say lawmakers need to broadly rethink how mergers are regulated when the buyer is a tech company with strong and growing market power.    Google\u2019s ad business is now a focus of wide-ranging investigations by the Justice Department and state attorneys general. The scrutiny includes whether the company choked off competitors, or shortchanged advertisers and publishers, and how it assembled its ad empire, including DoubleClick, an ad technology company and marketplace.    The Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust suit against Google by the end of the month. It is unclear whether the case will be focused on the ad business, or concentrate on renewed allegations that Google\u2019s search algorithm gives preference to its shopping and other commerce services and hobbles rivals.    That internal debate, many experts say, points to the challenge facing antitrust enforcement in a fast-moving, complex tech business: Investigations are difficult, long and backward looking.    Instead, those experts say, the country needs a more pre-emptive approach, making it much more difficult for big tech corporations to buy other companies \u2014 and perhaps forcing spinoffs if a past acquisition took out a nascent competitor or became a short cut to greater market power. In other words, changing the law so that Google would not have been able to buy DoubleClick.    The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews many mergers, approved the DoubleClick deal in a 4-to-1 vote. William Kovacic cast one of the four assenting votes.    \u201cIf I knew in 2007 what I know now, I would have voted to challenge the DoubleClick acquisition,\u201d said Mr. Kovacic, now a law professor at George Washington University who is among the experts pushing for stronger merger oversight.    In Senate testimony last week, Donald Harrison, Google\u2019s president of global partnerships and corporate development, described the DoubleClick deal and smaller ones in digital advertising as \u201cfinding a piece of technology\u201d that the company then invested in and strengthened to accelerate innovation.    Online ad prices, Mr. Harrison said, have fallen over the past decade, and it is a highly competitive marketplace.    The Prize    DoubleClick had a valuable asset: its business relationships and ad-serving technology used by thousands of publishers online.    In 2007, Google was a tenth of the size it is today. Still, it was a surging company and a heavyweight in search and in search advertising, with $16.6 billion in revenue. And it was headed for the business where DoubleClick made its living \u2014 larger display ads on websites and video ads. Google, for example, was giving away software tools that DoubleClick had charged for. To diversify, DoubleClick created an ad exchange, or marketplace, as a new business and a buffering source of revenue.    The auction for the company came down to three finalists, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google, said David Rosenblatt, a former chief executive of DoubleClick. The three bids were similar in value, he said, but Google, given its thriving search business, had access to the largest pool of advertisers, complementing DoubleClick\u2019s strength with publishers.    \u201cThe combination with Google made the most sense,\u201d Mr. Rosenblatt said.    Another former commissioner said a merger review was a prediction of whether competition may or may not result. But he added that it was an educated guess, made by regulators grounded in the present. No one foresaw the power that tech platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon would amass, said the former commissioner, who asked not to be identified because of potential conflicts with clients of his firm.    In its 2007 statement allowing the DoubleClick deal, the commission described broad swaths of the digital ad market as \u201crelatively nascent, dynamic and highly fragmented,\u201d adding that other big companies \u201cappear to be well positioned to compete vigorously against Google.\u201d    Microsoft, it seemed, could be a formidable rival. Just a month after Google announced the DoubleClick deal, Microsoft agreed to pay about twice as much \u2014 more than $6 billion \u2014 to acquire aQuantive, another digital ad company.    At the time, aQuantive mainly appealed to Microsoft as a competitor to Google that could slow its expansion plans in advertising. Microsoft saw Google as its most dangerous rival because it posed a threat to Microsoft\u2019s lifeblood products, Windows and Office, former executives say. Google was offering free versions of email, document and spreadsheet programs over the internet, subsidized by advertising.    \u201cWith DoubleClick, Google was playing offense, but aQuantive was a defensive move for Microsoft,\u201d said Brian McAndrews, the former chief executive of aQuantive. (Mr. McAndrews is a member of The New York Times\u2019s board of directors.)    For Microsoft, aQuantive was never really a priority, former executives say, and its leaders departed and it withered. In 2012, Microsoft publicly conceded that the deal had failed, taking a $6 billion write-off.    While DoubleClick was its largest deal by far, Google built up its ad technology business with a string of acquisitions. It bought start-ups that made software for publishers, advertisers and mobile ads, including AdMob in 2009, Invite Media in 2010 and AdMeld in 2011.    Those building blocks and its in-house innovations have given Google a strong presence in every step of buying and selling online ads.    \u201cGoogle has put it all together,\u201d said Jeffrey Rayport, an online marketing expert at the Harvard Business School. \u201cGoogle is the market under one roof.\u201d    The Competition    Google\u2019s one-stop shop is a huge convenience for the smaller businesses that generate much of the tech giant\u2019s revenue and do not have online advertising expertise. But the Google machine can seem like a fortress to ad tech companies seeking a slice of the market.    In 2007, with big companies scooping up digital ad properties, Brian O\u2019Kelley saw opportunity. He left Right Media, which Yahoo had just bought and where he had been chief technology officer, and founded AppNexus.    His ad tech start-up was meant to be an independent middleman for advertisers and publishers, an alternative to the rising powers of digital advertising, Google and later Facebook.    By 2010, the start-up was gaining momentum and attracting attention. That October, Microsoft led a $50 million round of venture funding in AppNexus. A month later, Mr. O\u2019Kelley said, AppNexus was cut off from DoubleClick, just as the peak holiday marketing season was getting underway.    \u201cThey almost killed us,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Kelley recalled.    Google said it could not comment on dealings with specific customers like AppNexus. But Google said that it had policies on \u201cad quality, ad content and malware\u201d and that violations sometimes led to suspending access to the DoubleClick ad exchange.    The issue, Mr. O\u2019Kelley said, was a technical one: Google\u2019s software attributed ads it said violated its rules to AppNexus rather than to the advertiser.    When the AppNexus cutoff raised alarm in the ad industry, Google issued a statement calling AppNexus \u201ca great partner\u201d and saying the two companies were working to resolve the matter.    The problem lasted a few weeks, a temporary blow to the start-up. The message Mr. O\u2019Kelley and his team took from the episode was that operating a business in the Google ad ecosystem could be precarious and unpredictable.    Over the next several years, AppNexus struggled at times, but it persevered and emerged as an alternative to the Google marketplace. In 2018, AT&amp;T bought AppNexus for $1.6 billion. AT&amp;T executives spoke of the company as a linchpin in AT&amp;T\u2019s vision of creating a television and digital video advertising exchange that would be a counterweight to Google and Facebook.    But those ambitions were scaled back, and the focus became using AppNexus to provide the best ad tech for AT&amp;T\u2019s Time Warner television and video units, including CNN, TBS and TNT. This month, The Wall Street Journal reported that AT&amp;T was looking to sell its digital ad unit.    Things might look different today if the Federal Trade Commission had made a different decision in 2007, said Mr. O\u2019Kelley, who left AT&amp;T in early 2019.    \u201cHad DoubleClick not gone to Google,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not clear that Google would have been the power it became \u2014 certainly not as easily.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Many who enjoy using the substance do so solely because of the pleasure they derive from it. Nicotine vapor products or \"e-cigarettes\" are not only a source of pleasure, but also a critical tool that has helped millions of adults kick their deadly smoking habit. Yet, at the same time that public and political support for legalizing recreational cannabis has soared, so also have calls to virtually eliminate or prohibit legal access to potentially life-saving nicotine vapor products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since e-cigarettes first entered the U.S. market around 2007, anti-smoking advocates have voiced concern about their possible hazards and demanded that government restrict their availability. That stance might have seemed reasonable in the beginning, since, as opponents argued, research on the products and their potential health effects was limited. It also implied that detractors would withdraw, or at least temper, their opposition to the sale of e-cigarettes should sufficient evidence reasonably establish their relative safety.</p><p>The evidence has emerged that e-cigarettes are vastly safer than smoking, even if not risk-free, and have the potential to save or improve millions of lives. Yet, anti-vaping advocates' hostility toward e-cigarettes has only intensified and governments around the world have begun banning the products. The reason, as this paper demonstrates, is that regulation of certain controversial substances often has little to do with evidence. As the comparison of the evidence on and debate over nicotine and cannabis reveal, the way some activists and policy makers treat controversal substances depends less on science and evidence than on the prevailing narrative they choose to believe and promote.</p><p>Though different in nature and purpose, the scientific evidence on cannabis and nicotine is remarkably similar, in terms of the risks they might pose. Decades of research and popular use confirm that the harms associated with regular cannabis use are, for most people, relatively minimal, even if some questions remain, such as, for example, on how it interacts with certain medications and psychiatric conditions or how it might impact adolescent development.</p><p>More importantly, history provides compelling evidence that whatever hazards might be associated with cannabis, they are preferable to those created by its prohibition. The federal ban on cannabis did little to stop its widespread use. As with alcohol before it, prohibiting cannabis spawned a sophisticated illicit market, incited contempt for the law, cost the economy billions of dollars, fomented distrust of law enforcement, and ruined countless lives. Thus, with research unable to identify any meaningful harms caused by cannabis use and witnessing the damage caused by its prohibition, the general consensus is that our society would be healthier, freer, and more just by restoring adults' ability to use cannabis legally.</p><p>Like cannabis, many unknowns remain about the effects of nicotine and nicotine vaping, but there is enough to know its risks are minimal and are substantially lower than for combustible tobacco. We also know that nicotine vapor products help adult smokers quit smoking, providing an immediate public health benefit by diverting smokers to less harmful alternatives. Banning e-cigarettes will not stop people from using them, but like every prohibition before it, push many toward more hazardous behaviors, such as buying from the illicit market or continuing to smoke. Yet, restrictions and bans on e-cigarettes continue to sweep across the nation.</p><p>This different treatment of two relatively analogous substances cannot be explained by the scientific evidence. It arises from what the public and, in particular, those in power choose to accept as evidence and the popular narrative this creates. Popular culture, the media, reform advocates, and individual users coalesced around a consensus that many adults enjoy cannabis and will continue to do so regardless of its legality. The general public now overwhelmingly believes that cannabis use is inevitable, prohibition is futile, and adults should have the right to use it simply because they enjoy it. But the same does not apply for nicotine.</p><p>For a long time, the narrative surrounding nicotine vapor has been one of fear and suspicion. It has increasingly focused on unknown risks and the threat e-cigarettes might pose to adolescents, even as the scientific evidence consistently shows these fears are overstated, and demonstrates the products' safety and benefits for adults. This was no accident.</p><p>Prior to the advent of e-cigarettes, declining smoking rates posed an existential threat to anti-tobacco activists and groups. As smoking declined in popularity, those who had built careers and organizations in the well-funded battle against smoking found themselves victims of their own success. E-cigarettes provided the perfect bogeyman to stoke public anxiety and revive fundraising. Thus, anti-tobacco activists redirected their efforts toward turning public opinion against these novel products.</p><p>Decades of promoting hostility toward \"Big Tobacco\" proved helpful for this effort. Like tobacco companies that once sought to deceive the public about the risks of smoking, anti-vaping activists waged a campaign to sow doubt about the safety of e-cigarettes. With billions in public funding, an army of affiliated academics, allies in government and media, and the support of industries threatened by new competition, activists generated a steady stream of negative headlines about \"vaping.\"</p><p>They knew from their fight with Big Tobacco that they could persuade the public of the need for government intervention if they believed that a choice posed risks, not just to the individual making it, but to those around him. So, as with secondhand smoke and youth smoking, anti-vaping advocacy focused on the threat e-cigarettes supposedly posed to adolescents and to public health.</p><p>The strategy has been wildly successful. While the evidence continues to mount in favor of e-cigarettes' effectiveness for smoking cessation, public opinion is increasingly in favor of banning the products. Even as America embraces an approach aimed at reducing the harms of risky behavior with policies like clean needle exchanges, sexual education, and cannabis legalization, we are turning more toward a zero-tolerance approach when it comes to nicotine. Unfortunately, that is because evidence is not the driving factor in the political debate over substance use.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>A large proportion of nicotine vapor users credit the products with saving their lives, a claim rarelyif ever made by those who use cannabis purely for recreation. Yet, while legalizing recreational cannabis is now a cause cel bre among liberal and some conservative politicians, a prohibition on nicotine vapor productssometimes referred to as electronic cigarettes has become an equally fashionable position, often among the same individuals.</p><p>Advocates of greater restrictions or bans on nicotine vaping cite a lack of evidence on the effects of vaping. That seems to imply that their position might change if the products' safety and efficacy were ever proved by research, but it has become clear that such a prospect is just a political smokescreen. As the divergent treatment of cannabis and nicotine demonstrates, when it comes to the regulation of substances, neither evidence, principles, nor even justice actually matter. All that matters is the popularity of the given narrative about a substance.</p><p>Cannabis and nicotine are both pleasurable substances that have enjoyed widespread popularity for hundreds of years. Both have a large body of scientific research, as well as many unanswered questions, about their effects on human health. Yet, in recent years cannabis has become far more popular. In 2017, 55 percent of American adults said they currently used marijuana, with 35 percent using it regularly.1 In contrast, nicotine use in the U.S. is at a historic low, with under 14 percent of adults categorized as current smokers and only 8 percent of adults saying they vaped within the past week as of 2019.2</p><p>Public opinion, among users and non-users alike, has evolved alongside these consumption patterns. A Gallup poll in 2019 found that 66 percent of the American public supported legalizing marijuana.3 The same year, a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority (52 percent) of Americans favored banning all but tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, while nearly half (49 percent) favored a total ban on nicotine vaping products.4 But this evolution in opinion, among both the public and politicians, is not based on conclusive scientific evidence.</p><p>After decades of research, there is enough evidence to assume that the health effects of cannabis use are unlikely to be life-threatening. For at least 20 years of study and public debate, the case for legalizing cannabisin terms of public safety, as well as social, economic, and personal well-beingis strong. This evidence, along with efforts by activists and health professionals to destigmatize the drug and its users, largely explain why the public and subsequently lawmakers have begun to look more favorably on legalizing cannabis.</p><p>However, the scientific evidence on the health effects of cannabis has remained largely inconclusive.5 Hampered by regulatory barriers, researchers have been able to shed light on some aspects of the drug's impact on health, but major questions remain unanswered.6 For example, there is very limited data on how tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) affects heart health.7 We are just beginning to understand how different patterns of use may interacteither positively or negativelywith other physical and psychological conditions, predispositions, and treatments.8</p><p>Furthermore, little is known about how cannabis alters brain function in adults and brain development in adolescents.9</p><p>On the other hand, the costs of prohibition on individuals, society, and the economy have proven catastrophic. For the last half century, Americans have observed the utter failure of banning cannabis to stop its widespread use; how it spawned sophisticated, international drug-trafficking networks; cost our economy billions; fomented distrust between the citizenry and law enforcement; and ruined untold numbers of lives.10 Outlawing the drug did not stop demand. Instead, it drove millions into the illicit market, where, in addition to any risks inherent to the drug, they are exposed to the additional hazards of interacting with criminals, potentially consuming adulterated or tainted products, and running afoul of the law. And, of course, the rise of the illicit market, with its outsized profits, draws many people into risky or criminal behavior, with often terrible consequences both for the individuals engaging in illicit activities and their communities.</p><p>By weighing what we do know about the health effects of cannabis against the known consequences of prohibition, America has come to the reasonable conclusion that whatever risks might ultimately be associated with cannabis use, they are lesser than, or preferable to, the harms created by its prohibition.</p><p>Regulation in the Face of Uncertainty</p><p>In the absence of complete and perfect scientific informationsomething almost no topic enjoysregulators must carefully weigh the strength of the evidence we do have about the potential harms and benefits of giving consumers legal access to substances against the likely harms and benefits of prohibiting that substance. With regard to cannabis, regulators, researchers, and the general public, for the most part, have rightly come to the conclusion that the costs of prohibition far outweigh the potential risks associated with legal access to the drug.</p><p>Were regulators and lawmakers to objectively perform this sort of calculation for nicotine, they would conclude the same for that substance. While it is true that, as with recreational cannabis, we may not fully understand all of the effects of nicotine vaping, there is enough evidence to conclude that the effects on health are limited to the degree that a regulatory scheme that maintains legal access to these products will be less detrimental to individual and public health than a prohibition on such products.</p><p>Nicotine vaping devices are a relatively new category of products, but tobacco and nicotine use, in various forms, is not. Though public health professionals have historically conflated the effects of smoking and nicotine, the advent of nicotine vaping, which separates the effects of nicotine from combustion, has become the subject of intense scientific study over the last 15 years. Because of public interest and the lack of regulatory barriers on its study, current clinical data on nicotine is as robust as that for recreational cannabis, if not more so.</p><p>We have more than 400 years of observation about non-combustible tobacco use, such as tobacco chew, snuff, and snus (moist snuff).11 There is also plenty of information available on the social and economic effects of various regulatory schemes for nicotine products, based on experiences in the U.S. and around the world.</p><p>As with recreational cannabis, the clinical evidence indicates that the health effects of nicotine vaping are minimalat least minimal enough that researchers have been unable to consistently demonstrate any negative effects at all. This is why nicotine replacement therapy, for example, is not associated with increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or other diseases commonly linked with smoking.12 Furthermore, the benefits to society of providing access to smokeless nicotine has been validated by studying the experiences of countries that have embraced lower risk tobacco alternatives, like Sweden.</p><p>Snus, a moist tobacco chew, has been in use in Sweden since the 17th century, but it gained in popularity beginning in the 1980s as the dangers of smoking became clearer and more well known. By 2016, approximately 21 percent of Swedish men were classified as current snus users, while just 7 percent of the population continued to smoke, and just 5 percent smoked daily.13 As a result of replacing a combustible tobacco with a non-combustible product, Sweden has not only the lowest smoking rate in Europe, but also the lowest rate of lung cancer by farand among the lowest rates of mouth cancer.14 In the rest of the European Union, where snus is banned, 24 percent of the population, on average, smoked as of 2016.15</p><p>Similar effects have been observed in Japan, where the rate of decline in cigarette sales has quintupled since the introduction of Philip Morris International's heated tobacco product, IQOS.16 Great Britain and the United States, where the government embraces or tolerates e-cigarettes, respectively, have seen similar accelerations in the decline of smoking.17</p><p>More importantly, perhaps, evidence from around the world demonstrates that government policies that seek to restrict legal access to nicotine, whether through regulatory barriers, bans, or price controls, do not prevent nicotine use. Instead, illicit markets, and all of the harms that accompany them, rise to meet the demand.18</p><p>The ability and willingness of the public to flout restrictive drug laws has been on display in the United States and elsewhere with regard to cannabis. Not only did Americans continue to use the substance after its ban, but some made ostentatious displays out of flouting the prohibition. Cannabis was popular among jazz musicians during the first half of the 20th century, a fact not lost on prohibitionists of that era, who pursued famous musicians, like Louie Armstrong and Billie Holiday.19</p><p>And long before the first U.S. state legalized its use, the comedy duo Cheech and Chong arguably established a new genre of cinema with their stoner comedy films, beginning with the 1978 cult classic Up in Smoke. And beginning in the 1970s, hip hop and rap artists used marijuana in their lyrics (and lives) as a form of rebellion against and rejection of a mainstream society they believe marginalizes individuals and communities of color.20 By the 1990s rap and the stoner comedy had been incorporated, at least in some forms, into popular mass media. It was this \"mainstreaming\" of art forms with positive and often celebratory representations of cannabis use, more than any scientific break- through, that acted to destigmatize the drug, change popular opinion, and pave the way for legalization.21</p><p>Though different in their chemical makeup, biological effects, and purpose, the scientific literature on recreational cannabis and nicotine are remarkably analogous. Current clinical data suggests both substances are relatively safe, emerging evidence even points to potential health benefits for both, and plenty of research demonstrates the harms associated with the prohibition of either. Nicotine vapor products have the additional benefit of typically being used,</p><p>not just for enjoyment, but as a replacement for deadly combustible tobacco products, like cigarettes. Yet, one of these drugscannabisenjoys increasing popular and political support and decreased stigmatization, while the othernicotineis progressively maligned, stigmatized, and the target of bans and restrictions.</p><p>This asymmetry in the treatment of the two substances cannot be explained by the amount or strength of the scientific evidence for their relative benefits or harms. Instead, it stems from what those in power are willing to accept as evidence.22 The notion that people enjoy using cannabis and will continue to do so regardless of its legal status is now widely accepted. The inevitability of widespread cannabis use and the futility and harm of its continued prohibition are sufficient justification to advocate for an end of the federal cannabis ban. That logic, though demonstrably true for both cannabis and nicotine, has proved insufficient to convince advocates, regulators,</p><p>and even some researchers. Unlike recreational cannabis, for nicotine vapor they demand \"proof\" of the products' value before they are allowed onto the market.23 Yet, it remains unclear what type ofand how muchevidence it would take to meet their threshold of proof.</p><p>Drug Double Standard</p><p>It is reasonable for public health professionals, lawmakers, and the public to want evidence about products prior to making decisions about how they ought to be regulated. In the case of vaping, this evidence is available. Toxicology studies show that even the earliest e-cigarette devices on the market contained only a fraction of the harmful and potentially harmful constituents found in traditional cigarettes.24 Studies also show that exhaled vapor contains 99 percent fewer carcinogens than secondhand smoke.25 Epidemiological studies have repeatedly found that the vast majority of those using nicotine vapor products are former smokers.26</p><p>As with cannabis, evidence has also disproved the claim that nicotine vaping is a \"gateway\" to more harmful substances, in this case smoking combustible tobacco.27 Perhaps the most convincing evidence against the idea that vaping leads to smoking is that, even as youth experimentation with vaping has risen significantly over the 13 years since its introduction, youth and adult smoking have continued to decrease. Studies, including one randomized clinical trial (considered by some to be the gold standard in health research), have even demonstrated that nicotine vapor products are two to three times more effective at helping smokers quit than other nicotine replacement therapies (NRT).28</p><p>Each of the aforementioned studies, along with any before or since showing similar findings, were, without exception, rejected by the individuals and groups demanding proof of the value of nicotine vapor products. As Clive Bates, the former director of the British tobacco control group Action on Smoking and Health, wrote in 2018, the justifications provided by anti-vaping advocates for spurning these studies follow an almost comically predictable pattern.</p><p>Harm is the essential currency of tobacco control campaigning. For these activists, cancer and other harms have acquired valuable utility: it is the \"killer\" arguments to justify the forceful action of the state. If there is no cancer or other harms, they have lost an argument to support the real goal. Hence, we see desperate, often risible, efforts to turn nugatory risks into full-blown moral panics. If concerned about health, why do they never talk about how e-cigarette vapour has few of the harmful agents present in cigarette smoke and those that are present at far lower concentrations? Because disease risk creates the currency of fear and righteous indignation, and fear and indignation is the gateway to regulation.29 [Emphases in original]</p><p>Typically, critics of nicotine vaping respond to studies with results they dislike by quibbling over flaws in the methodology, the length of the study, and questions the researchers did not seek to answer.</p><p>Dozens of observational studies are often dismissed as being merely based on anecdotes. Those dismissals are often accompanied by calls for randomized controlled trials, which could really prove whether nicotine vapor products are effective as cessation tools.30 When researchers performed a randomized controlled trial and found that e-cigarettes were twice as effective as other nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation, anti-vaping interests dismissed it as being too clinical and \"not a study of e-cigarettes as most people use them.\"31</p><p>The most consistently employed argument against studies showing few or no negative health effects related to nicotine vapor is that they are not conducted over a long enough period of time to reveal the harms from chronic use of the products over decades. When supplied with research that follows participants for years which would be able to identify bio- logical changes related to long-term healthanti-tobacco activists simply return to the other tactical arguments.</p><p>For example, in 2017 researchers published the results of a study comparing circulating levels of smoking-related toxins linked to cancer, heart disease, and lung disease among long-term smokers, e-cigarette users, users of nicotine replacement therapies, and \"dual\" usersthose who both smoke and use NRT or e-cigarettes. While dual users in any combination had similar levels of harmful toxins to that of smokers, individuals using e-cigarettes exclusively for six months or more had similarly low or significantly lower levels of circulating toxins than exclusive NRT users.32 Rather than celebrate this as evidence that long-term e-cigarette use is, at the very least, no more harmful than long-term NRT usea practice widely encouraged by anti-tobacco advocates vaping opponents focused on the finding that e-cigarette users who also smoked had toxin levels similar to smokers, an unsurprising result that is largely, if not entirely, explained by their smoking.</p><p>\"Everyoneincluding meagrees that switching entirely from cigarettes to e-cigarettes (assuming no effects on cessation) would be a good thing,\" wrote Stanton Glantz, a longtime anti-tobacco activist and professor at the University of California, San Francisco.33 \"The problem is, as this paper notes, that almost all e-cigarette users keep smoking cigarettes ... for the great majority of e-cigarette users as they are actually used in the real world, there is no health benefit of e-cigarettes\" he continued.34 [Emphasis in original]</p><p>Glantz is incorrect that the study found \"almost all e-cigarette users keep smoking.\" The study did not, and could not by design, determine the prevalence of dual use in the population because the researchers recruited equal numbers of participants for each group studied. More importantly, even if it were true that many e-cigarette users continue to smoke, that, along with the results of this study, in no way supports the claim that e-cigarettes have \"no health benefits\" for smokers. In the real world, the study's ground- breaking finding, that the harms of long-term e-cigarette use are as low and possibly lower than long-term NRT use, is compelling evidence that researchers and activists, like Glantz, should figure out how to encourage smokers to switch to e-cigarettes exclusively. Indeed, this was suggested by the study's authors, who wrote that their finding of similar nicotine intake levels among smokers, exclusive NRT users, and exclusive e-cigarette users \"supports the view that users seek a particular level of nicotine intake, regardless of the delivery system.\" Thus, they concluded that \"dual users should be encouraged to cease using combustible products to reduce long-term health risks.\"35</p><p>The argument made by Glantz provides a good example of the double standard of proof applied to nicotine vapor products. Based solely on the unsupported idea that most e-cigarette users continue to smoke, Glantz is willing to dismiss the possibility that nicotine vapor products have any benefit and to advocate for their total prohibition.36 Interestingly, Glantz omits from this conversation the evidence that continued smoking by users of nicotine replacement therapies is also extremely common. According to some estimates, as little as 1 or 2 percent of NRT users even attempt to achieve abstinence from smoking, while a higher percentage intend merely to reduce their cigarette consumption.37 However, studies have found that smokers who use NRTs actually smoke more cigarettes than smokers not using such products.38 This real world experience with NRTs has not led anti-tobacco activists to call for banning the products.39 In fact, some of the most vociferously anti-vaping entities, like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, not only support over-the-counter sales of NRT products, but advocate for governments to subsidize their provision to adult smokers.40</p><p>Criticisms of the evidence that nicotine vaping is relatively harmless or even beneficial are often joined with statements about the lack of long-term evidence and how many decades it took researchers to demonstrate the devastating harms associated with smoking.41 This implies that it would take modern researchers, despite all the advances in science and technology, a similar amount of time to understand the effects of nicotine vaping. That is a disingenuous argument, given that research on smoking began in the 1940s when science on the topic was nascent.</p><p>It certainly would be nice to have multidecade studies on every possible consequence of a product prior to its introduction on the market. But that criterion is as impractical as it is unnecessary. Virtually nothing in life is free of risk entirely. As Fred Smith, the founder of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, once remarked, if \"society demands unattainable levels of safetya risk-free worldpublic policy becomes divorced from reality.\"42 For almost every other aspect of human life, we recognize the reality that proof of total safety is unrealistic. Moreover, we inherently grasp that applying such a standard would produce economic, technological, and personal paralysis. But, when it comes to lower-risk means of nicotine consumption, that is the standard that activists demand, despite the potential of such products to save and improve millions of lives around the world.</p><p>There are already hundreds, if not thousands, of studies on nicotine vaping, including on animals and humans, observational and clinical, and short- and long-term.43 These studies, while not answering every possible question that might arise surrounding nicotine vapor, are enough for researchers to measure biological changes that would indicate long-term risk. Thus far, the research does not indicate any significant long-term harms, particularly for those who are using nicotine vaping to replace the far more harmful habit of smoking.</p><p>The standard of evidence that anti- tobacco activists demand for nicotine vaping is not applied to any other category of consumer good. For instance, a lack of decades-long studies that might definitively and comprehensively reveal all possible risks has not stopped the introduction of new pharmaceutical drugs.44 Although the entire approval process is arduous and lengthy, lasting upwards of a decade or longer, the duration of individual trials, which form the evidence for a new drug's safety and efficacy, can last for just one year.45 Even for many drugs intended to be taken regularly over a period of many years, like antidepressants and cholesterol-lowering statins, long-term studies are not required prior to their introduction to the market, so long as there are at least two positive short-term (eight- to 12-week) trials.46</p><p>For example, in March 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Spravato, a nasal spray antidepressant chemically related to the drug ketamine. This approval occurred even though the longest trial of the drug was no more than 60 weeks.47 Non-pharmaceutical products require even less study, such as the ultra-low- nicotine cigarettes approved by the FDA in December 2019, for which the longest studies were a mere 20 weeks, with many questions remaining about whether smokers using low nicotine cigarettes will actually smoke more.48 As for cannabis, only a single product has been approved by the FDA. In this case, studies of the CBD medication intended to treat seizure disorders lasted less than a year.49 No other cannabis products sold in the U.S., with or without THC, have undergone such a review. Yet, the lack of certainty about how cannabis affects adolescent brain development, an issue on which anti-vaping advocates seem singularly focused when it comes to nicotine, has not stopped the growingand justifiedpush for cannabis legalization.50</p><p>The American Lung Association (ALA), for example, has been vocally opposed to nicotine vapor products and has lobbied state and federal governments to institute bans and restrictions against their sale and advertising.51 With regard to cannabis, the ALA once was a vocal opponent of the drug's use, claimed that \"marijuana deposits four times more tar in the lungs than tobacco,\" and ran a campaign in the 1980s titled, \"Don't Let Your Lungs Go to Pot.\"52 Today, however, apart from advocating that cannabis be included in indoor smoking bans, the ALA is conspicuously silent on the issue of cannabis legalization and regulation.53</p><p>As with cannabis, a lack of definitive evidence has neither stopped the government from approving, nor society from accepting, a range of other products, medications, and devices. That is as it should be.</p><p>Long-term studies that unequivocally tell us, for example, how cannabis would affect every aspect of individual and social welfare are not only impossible for each facet of the drug's development and deployment, they are also unnecessary. We now have enough information to know that whatever harms may be associated with cannabis use, they are minimal in comparison to the harms created by prohibition. The same is true of nicotine and nicotine vapor products. Yet, when it comes to nicotine vaping, the evidence doesn't seem to matter. The constant appeals for proof and the way substances are treated by lawmakers, regulators, the media, and the public are not determined by scientific evidence, but are based on how people feel about the substance. In the current moment, at least, the majority of the public now accepts cannabis use as a relatively harmless activity, akin to drinking alcohol. Unfortunately, the way most people feel about nicotine is inextricably linked to their feelings about \"Big Tobacco.\"</p><p>Moral Entrepreneurs</p><p>At the heart of the modern tobacco control movement are what sociologist Howard S. Becker calls \"moral entrepreneurs.\"54 These professional arbiters of morality or rule makers typically begin as passionate amateurs, often with humanitarian motives. They do not simply want to impose their moral views on others, but operate from the belief that doing so will improve the well-being of society.</p><p>This ostensibly pure intention provides justification for moral crusaders to pursue their goals by any means necessary, including working with those with dubious motives, exaggeration, defamation of the opposition, disregarding others' autonomy, and persecuting those who disobeyfor their own good, of course.</p><p>The crusader who manages to convince the public of the validity of his cause may be able to build large organizational structures around it and turn his passion into a vocation. But this presents a conundrum for the crusader: If successful, he would essentially be putting himself out of a job. Such was the case for the enterprise of anti-smoking activism.</p><p>After decades of raising awareness about its risks and convincing the public and government officials of the need to control smoking, the habit was headed toward extinction. By the 21st century, smoking had become a socially stigmatized, deviant behavior in many developed nations. Many countries, particularly the U.S., had also banned smoking in public spaces, imposed taxes on the products, and adopted strict tobacco control policies.</p><p>By the mid-2000s, precipitous declines in smoking had diminished public concern over the habit's health effects, which in turn lessened interest in funding cessation efforts. This waning attention threatened what had become a multi-billion-dollar anti-smoking industry and the thousands of agencies, departments, charities, and careers built around it. Rather than kill the anti-smoking cash cow, activists sought to expand their crusade to new targetsnot only smoking, but any use of tobacco and, more recently, any use of non-pharmaceutical nicotine.</p><p>As Becker wrote, a moral crusader who manages to achieve his original goal \"may generalize his interest and discover something new to view with alarm, a new evil about which something ought to be done. He becomes a professional discoverer of wrongs to be righted, of situations requiring new rules.\"55</p><p>The rise in popularity of nicotine vaping occurred, not coincidentally, at the same time as the anti-smoking activism industry was desperately searching for a new target. Their attempts to foment renewed moral panic over products like flavored nicotine lozenges, bidis (mini cigars), clove cigarettes, and nicotine-free cigarettes fell flat.56 But then came electronic cigarettes. With a similar- sounding name, look, and even smoke-like plumes of vapor emitted from the devices, electronic cigarettes proved the perfect new target for moral entrepreneurs to continue their crusade against Big Tobaccoeven if Big Tobacco, particularly in the beginning, had nothing to do with the novel products.</p><p>The \"Big Tobacco\" Bogeyman With good reason, people maintain a deep distrust of big tobacco companies, which historically had long denied the deadly effects of combustible tobacco of which they were aware, putting significant resources into casting doubt on and undermining evidence of those harms as it emerged. However, this understandable mistrust has been extended, often intentionally, by anti-tobacco advocates, to any person, group, or industry that appears to be, or is accused of being, linked to big tobacco companies.</p><p>This near-universal contempt for Big Tobacco and the effectiveness of guilt by association with it is well-known among activists of all stripes. This explains the proliferation of accusations of \"stealing a page out of the Big Tobacco playbook\" hurled at various businesses and industries including food marketers, soda companies, the alcohol industry, the tech industry, social media platforms, climate change skeptics, lawmakers, and even the National Football League. 57</p><p>Those who oppose the use of nicotine on moral grounds have made little attempt to hide their use of this tactic as a way to discredit any person or study unsupportive of their abstinence- only approach. In a 1986 handbook on anti-tobacco activism, the authors including the aforementioned Stanton Glantzadvised that inconvenient studies could be easily explained away by pointing to \"the self-interest of the authors, defective methodology, or sheer weight of numbers of contradictory studies\" and that activists should \"suggest that the person is simply a shill for the tobacco industry.\"58 A few years later, Glantz, in a speech, noted that a similar approach could be used to convince reluctant lawmakers to support their anti-tobacco policies, noting that a good way to change their minds is to convince them that \"if they oppose you they would be perceived as dupes of the cigarette companies.\"59</p><p>As blatant and opportunistic as that is, the strategy continues to work effectively in convincing many that any nicotine product, not produced by \"Big Pharma,\" is merely an extension of \"Big Tobacco.\" That leaves them free to disregard any evidence about the relative harmlessness or possible benefits of the substance.</p><p>Anti-tobacco groups have used this tactic to paint the nicotine vapor industry as no different from Big Tobacco. But this simplistic view ignores the fact that while large tobacco companies have now entered the nicotine vapor market, the industry was initially established and remains primarily populated by small, independent vapor companies that were never involved in the tobacco business.</p><p>More importantly, it also fails to acknowledge that the central reason these independent vapor companies and shops exist is to displace combustible tobacco. Still, the mere fact that the initial generations of nicotine vapor products looked similar to cigarettes, were sometimes called electronic cigarettes, and contained nicotine despite not having any tobacco, was enough for activists to convince the federal government to deem the products \"tobacco\" in 2016.60 This bureaucratic categorization of nicotine vapor as tobacco product, plus the superficial similarities with traditional cigarettes, made it easy for activists to convince those unfamiliar with the novel products that they were the same as combustible tobacco, made by the same companies, with the same purpose and risks. (This is a little like viewing distilled spirits and rubbing alcohol in the same light.)</p><p>Merchants of Doubt and Fear Ironically, both the impossibly high double standard for scientific evidence and attempts to create a mental link between nicotine vaping and Big Tobacco are exactly the same strategies used by Big Tobacco since the 1950s to suppress growing evidence of the harms associated with smoking.61 This awareness of Big Tobacco's past bad behavior and the public's distrust of the industry significantly increase the potency of anti-tobacco activists' primary argument against nicotine vaping: the safety of children.</p><p>\"Won't somebody think of the children\" was the oft-repeated catchphrase of Helen Lovejoy, wife of Reverend Lovejoy on the television comedy The Simpsons. This parody of the overwrought and myopic focus on child welfare, which often pervades real-world political debates, was so deft that Toronto Star reporter Edward Keenan coined the term \"Lovejoy's Law.\" In Keenan's words, if one side of a debate uses \"the children\" to justify their position, one can assume it is an attempt to manipulate and that, \"they're probably either lying, trying to screw you over or hoping to distract you from the worthlessness of their position.\"62</p><p>In the case of nicotine vaping, evidence continues to mount that it is relatively harmless for adults. Even the assertion that nicotine is \"highly addictive,\" something most people believe is irrefutably true, is contradicted by evidence and logic. People rarely become addicted to nicotine patches, gums, or lozenges. Animal and human studies have found that nicotine alone is not sufficient to prompt self-administration or nicotine- seeking behaviorfor instance, lab mice do not press the lever delivering nicotine over the lever that delivers food. That suggests that is some other chemical, combination of chemicals, or feature of cigarettes that makes products containing nicotine habit- forming.63</p><p>Unable to justify their opposition to nicotine use based on demonstrable harms to adults, anti-tobacco activists instead have focused on the imaginary risks nicotine vapor products pose to children. Among the most frequently cited concerns are claims that nicotine vaping harms the adolescent brain and leads to future smokingclaims for which the evidence is weak, non- existent, or invalidating.</p><p>The idea that nicotine damages adolescent brains or impairs their development are based primarily on rat and mouse studies that report relatively minor effects, like changes in learning, attention, and memory.64 Interestingly, as a topic of debate, the effects of substances on youth brain health seem exclusive to public discourse on nicotine and tobacco. As researchers Lynn Kozlowski of the University of Buffalo and Kenneth Warner of the University of Michigan pointed out in 2017, there has been little public interest in the impact on brain health of other substances commonly used by youth, like alcohol, cannabis, caffeine, and psychotropic medications. \"If anything, the concern should be greater regarding kids' cigarette smoking but it was rarely brought into discussions of youth smoking,\" they wrote.65 Given the fact that there are many decades of studies on smokers, most of whom began smoking as young adults, the evidence that nicotine causes brain damage or significant cognitive impairment should be strong and abundant. Until relatively recently, in fact, a significant portion of youth reported daily smoking. If nicotine caused significant harms on the developing brain, it would be apparent in the scientific literature, but it is not. Yet, the adolescent brain issue has become one of the central arguments used by anti-vaping activists.</p><p>It is worth noting that while the adolescent brain issue has not yet been a major factor in the public discourse about cannabis, this could quickly change. As this paper argues, increasing public acceptance of cannabis use has made the continuation of prohibition on the drug unfeasible for politicians and a bad target for moral entrepreneurs. But these circumstances may be tenuous and temporary. As a recent article in The Atlantic pointed out, 2020 democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not fully endorsed the idea of cannabis legalization despite broad public support, particularly among democratic voters. One explanation provided for his reticence is the divergent treatment of nicotine vaping and cannabis.</p><p>Liberal lawmakers have argued for restrictions on vaping because of a lack of clarity on its health effects, but these same lawmakers have not applied that standard to marijuana, which they mostly favor legalizing.66 Yet, should moral entrepreneurs decide to make pot smoking their next target, they could easily rely on all of the same dubious arguments and evidence that have been used against nicotine vaping, including the claim that cannabis may \"harm\" adolescent brain development.67</p><p>Another pseudoscientific argument regularly employed in public policy debates over drugs is the \"gateway\" theory: the idea that the use of relatively benign drugs, like cannabis or nicotine, will lead to harder drugs and subsequent harms. The idea seems to make logical sense, since individuals who go on to use drugs like heroin typically begin experimenting with \"softer\" drugs. But the correlation does not necessarily prove that the cannabis use, for example, caused a person to later use heroin, as many other factors better explain individuals' likelihood to use either drug, such as a proclivity for risk taking.68</p><p>Similarly, some have claimed that vaping among youth, even experimental, will lead to future smoking. But, as with cannabis, the evidence indicates that there is no \"gateway\" effect from using nicotine vapor products. Research on the gateway effect finds that teens who are likely to smoke are also likely to try nicotine vaping, due to shared characteristics, such as a greater propensity for risk taking, not because vaping somehow causes them to progress to smoking.69 The clearest piece of evidence against the vaping gateway theory is the fact that despite nearly a decade of popular use, youth smoking has not increased. In fact, the number of adolescents who smoke is now lower than it has ever been.70 Moreover, most youth don't vape, fewer vape regularly, and almost of all those who do vape regularly are or were smokers, a behavior that would cause at least as much damage as vaping.</p><p>Yet, lack of evidence that nicotine vaping harms or even poses a risk to the nation's young people has done little to slow down activists, lawmakers, and regulators from trying to implement increasingly restrictive rules and outright bans on the products. For these interests, there is little downside to pursuing an anti-vaping agenda, as long as it is perceived as being anti-Big Tobaccoeven if achieving that agenda would have no benefit for, or even harm, public health.</p><p>Lower-Risk Nicotine:</p><p>The Low-Hanging Fruit When it comes to persuading lawmakers to support their cause,</p><p>anti-tobacco activists have discovered that even more effective than the old tactic of guilt by association is what could be called \"hero by association\" going after an easily identifiable villain to make yourself look heroic.</p><p>For ambitious politicians looking to generate positive public attention, targeting \"Big Tobacco\" is among the surefire ways to achieve that.</p><p>The only potential pitfall to that approach is that Big Tobaccoreal Big Tobaccois an established, large, well-funded, and well-connected international industry. Attacking the makers of cigarettes, farmers who grow tobacco, and smokers is not without political risk. The vapor market, on the other hand, is nascent, smaller, and has less consumer popularity and political influence. Incurring the wrath of the vapor industry and its customers is a comparatively small risk for politiciansbut also politically less profitable if there is a widespread belief that vapor products are less harmful alternatives to smoking.</p><p>For anti-vaping advocates, the best environment for them to operate is the current one, in which the majority of the public believe that going after \"vaping\" is the same as taking on Big Tobacco. This situation allows lawmakers who attack \"vaping\" to appear as if they are defenders of public health against a powerful opponent like Big Tobacco, with little risk of political blowbackeven when the outcome of their proposed legislative solutions would help Big Tobacco by crippling or outright eliminating its primary competitors.</p><p>The main culprit anti-vaping activists point to as evidence of Big Tobacco's control of the nicotine vaping industry is the company Juul. Founded by</p><p>Pax Labs, Juul began as a San Francisco-based startup technology firm with no connections to the tobacco industry. However, as activists fomented panic over youth vaping and regulators put increasing pressure on the company, threatening its existence, in 2018 Juulthen independent from Pax Labssold a 35 percent stake in the company to Altria Group formerly known as Philip Morris Companies, Inc. The deal was misleadingly portrayed by activists of proof that Juul, and by extension the entire vapor industry, was part of Big Tobacco all along.71 But the circumstances and regulatory pressure created by anti-vaping advocacy made such a merger a practical necessity for Juul to survive as a company. The main benefit Juul reaps from the merger with Altria is expertise and money to contend with increasingly intense regulatory challenges and lawsuits the company now faces as a result of anti-tobacco activism.72</p><p>Notwithstanding that reality, anti- tobacco activists have successfully used the bugbear of Big Tobacco, guilt by association, and exaggerated concerns about adolescents' health to advance their policy agenda with considerable success. At no time in the past has their approach been more brazenly on display than over the past year.</p><p>COVID-19 Gives Activists a New Front</p><p>Around July 2019, news stories began circulating about a sudden rash of people, mostly teenagers, being hospitalized with a mysterious and severe lung ailment linked to \"vaping.\"73 As the number of cases began rising and details trickled out through local news reporting, it became clear that the behavior shared in common among mostif not all of the patients was not \"vaping,\" but the use of cannabis vaporizers purchased illegally on the street.74</p><p>For example, when New York state authorities tested the vaping products used by those hospitalized with the lung ailment, they found that every single one had been using at least one THC vaping product purchased illicitly. They also found very high levels of vitamin E acetatean oil that cannot be present in nicotine e-liquidin many.75 Soon other states reported similar findings with all or nearly all patients admitting to using illicit THC products, even in states where cannabis is not legal.76 Despite all this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) downplayed the role of illicit THC products, urging consumers instead to avoid \"all e-cigarette, or vaping products.\"77</p><p>Anti-tobacco activists across the country capitalized on the confusion created by the CDC's misleading messaging to spread fears about nicotine vapor products and advance their regulatory and legislative agenda. Governors in states like Michigan, New York, and Massachusetts, encouraged by anti-tobacco groups, imposed emergency bans on nicotine vaping products, despite all the evidence indicating their having nothing to do with the outbreak.78 Congress held two hearings on the issue of nicotine vaping, at which activists invited to testify gleefully blamed nicotine vaping products for the outbreak of lung injuries, despite the demonstrable evidence to the contrary. And members of Congress have considered legislation to restrict the devices at the federal level.79</p><p>It wasn't until January 19, 2020 that the CDC acknowledged that illegal cannabis vaporizers tainted with vitamin E acetatenot nicotine vaping productswere behind the outbreak.80 But anti-vaping interests would not have to wait long for a new opportunity to spread unwarranted fears over nicotine vaping.</p><p>At the beginning of the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, it was assumed that smoking was a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 or for severe progression of the disease. While there was no specific data on this novel virus, the assumption seemed reasonable, based on the fact that smokers are at greater risk for certain respiratory infections, like colds, flu, pneumonia, and tuberculosis.81</p><p>However, anti-tobacco activists, in and outside government, ignored the emerging data indicating that smokers did not appear to be more at risk of COVID-19 than non-smokers, as well as the absence of any data on how vaping might affect progression of the disease. Instead, interest groups, health organizations, and politicians around the world seized on the opportunity to promote the idea that vaping is dangerous, and especially so during the outbreak.</p><p>New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told journalists that a 22-year old who was hospitalized with COVID-19 in early March had no known risk factors, except his use of vaping products. \"Why is a 22-year-old man stable but hospitalized at this point? The one factor we know of is he is a vaper,\" de Blasio said. \"So, we don't know of any preexisting conditions, but we do think the fact that he is a vaper is affecting this situation.\"82 The resulting speculation led to news articles and opinion pieces warning that smokers and vapers could be at greater risk during the outbreak.83</p><p>Health agencies added fuel to the fire. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (part of the National Institutes of Health) issued a warning that \"because it attacks the lungs, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke tobacco ... or who vape.\"84 The mere suggestion that nicotine vaping might have any impact on the outbreak was proof enough for activists and lawmakers to push for temporary bans on the products at the state and federal level.</p><p>Groups like the New York State Academy of Family Physicians appealed to the governor to institute a statewide ban on all tobacco products, while members of the House Oversight Committee appealed to the FDA to do the same across the nation.85 Activist academics, like Stanton Glantz, argued that vaping makes it harder for lungs to resist infection, even going so far as to give the unsupported medical advice that quitting vaping would lower the risks associated with the disease.86</p><p>This narrative has become increasingly difficult to sustain the more researchers look into the disease, and it now appears that nicotinenot smoking per semay actually have a protective effect.</p><p>Early data on the outbreak from China did not suggest that smokers were more likely to contract COVID-19. In fact, they appeared less likely to be hospitalized with the disease. That data contradicted assertions that smoking might explain why Chinese men over half of whom smokewere dying at much higher rates than women, of whom only 3 percent smoke.87 But, when researchers looked into the smoking habits of patients in that country, they found just 1.4 to 12.6 percent of those hospitalized with the disease were classified as current smokers, making smokers significantly underrepresented in hospitalized cases compared to the general public.88</p><p>This underrepresentation of smokers among COVID-19 patients has been found by numerous studies in populations around the world.89 These counterintuitive results led some researchers to question which ingredient or factor linked to smoking might provide an explanation, with several teams proposing plausible biological explanations for how nicotine might have a protective effect.90 The data, combined with credible theories about the mechanism, was convincing enough that at least one team of researchers is currently testing to see if providing nicotine patches to health care workers and patients might help prevent the spread of the disease.91</p><p>Upon the publication of the studies showing smokers were underrepresented in hospitalized COVID-19 cases, anti-tobacco activists launched a media campaign to cast doubt on the findings.92</p><p>They raised the usual claims of methodological inadequacies and labeled the mere suggestion that nicotine could play a beneficial role in the outbreak \"dangerous to public health.\"93</p><p>Although researchers were simply asking logical questions based on the observation of datathat is, the scientific methodand statements about the lack of evidence linking vaping to greater COVID-19 risk were in response to the science-free claims that smoking and vaping were a risk factor, anti-tobacco advocates painted the pushback as a Big Tobacco public relations ploy.94 They also insinuated that researchers studying the possibility that nicotine might save lives from this deadly virus were shills for the tobacco industry.</p><p>Among those attacked was Jean-Pierre Changeux of Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital in Paris, a world- renowned neuroscientist who, among other honors, was awarded the prestigious Wolf Prize in Medicine recipients of which often go on to win the Nobel Prize.95 In April 2020, Changeux announced that his team would begin trials to test whether providing patients and health care workers with nicotine patches could reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or lessen the severity of COVID-19 should they become infected.96 For asking and attempting to answer these questions, Changeux was derided in an op-ed in The Hill for supposedly having \"long-standing links with</p><p>the tobacco industry\" because his laboratory received a $220,000 grant from the industry-funded Council for Tobacco Research in the mid-1990s to study the effects of nicotine on the brains of mice. One of the authors of that article sits on the advisory board of an advocacy group called Parents Against Vaping E-Cigs.97 There is no evidence that Changeux's work was influenced by the source of his funding, nor evidence that the Council tried to influence it. Yet, the accusation of a long-ago tie to the industry is evidence enough for anti-nicotine activists to dismiss his work even before it is completed.98</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>For nearly every other risky substance or potentially harmful human behavior, public health advocates acknowledge the futility of taking an abstinence-only approach. The public health community and society at large have embraced the concept of \"harm reduction\"such as, for example, providing prophylactics and contraceptives to reduce sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy, supporting clean needle exchange programs to reduce disease spread through intravenous drug use, supplying methadone as a safer alternative for opioid addicts, and eschewing prohibition in favor of legal, regulated markets for recreational drugs like alcohol and cannabis.</p><p>Yet, when it comes to nicotine, abstinence-only is the only approach many are willing to accept. Individuals and groups ostensibly dedicated to preventing the death and disease caused by smoking have become so blinded by their bias against \"Big Tobacco\" that they are unable or unwilling to entertain the possibility that nicotine, divorced from the harmful effects of smoking, might offer a solution.</p><p>Anti-tobacco activists have waged a relentless messaging campaign to ensure that the conversation around nicotine remains uniformly negative. They have consistently worked to suppress any investigation into the possibility that nicotine is not all that bad (or bad at all when divorced from combustion), blame nicotine products for harms caused by other substances, and seek to shut down any challenge to that narrative.99</p><p>Despite their efforts, the evidence about nicotine continues to demonstrate the increasing likelihood that it is not only relatively harmless, but also has potential as a treatment for a range of diseases and conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, depression, ulcerative colitis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and now, possibly, COVID-19.100</p><p>But perhaps the most significant benefit that safer forms of nicotine consumption would offer human health is the reduction or elimination of combustible tobacco use, which contributes to the deaths of more than 8 million people worldwide every year.101 This opportunity will be squandered if those in power fail to recognize the evidence and communicate it accurately to the public.</p><p>Unfortunately, evidence is not the driving factor in the political debate over nicotine. All that those on the anti-tobacco side of the debate seem to care about is maintaining their narrative, beating Big Tobacco, and eliminating access to safer, legal forms of nicotine, no matter how many people die as a result.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>Christopher Ingraham, \"11 charts that show marijuana has truly gone mainstream,\" The Washington Post, April 19, 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream</url>.

With Brexit approaching, an answer to that question feels more urgently needed than it has for some time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ask a hundred people and you might expect to encounter some recurring themes. Democracy perhaps? What about fairness? Liberalism, tolerance and humour might get a look in. The stiff upper lip might still be mentioned by a few, as might queueing. What about free speech? We are, after all, a nation that apparently likes to speak its mind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Freedom of speech can mean all sorts of things though. And concepts of safe spaces and no-platforming have led many to question whether the right not to be offended has come to be a greater concern for many of us than the right of even those with deeply offensive views to express them.</p><p>The news media, in its many and varied guises, has often been regarded as the symbol of Britain's commitment to free expression. Elements of it may have been rambunctious but better that than being cowed - or, even worse, dull.</p><p>Social media's rise has made the role of the traditional media arguably less emblematic. Indeed, the more ardent critics of the now patronisingly acronymed \"MSM\" have sought to present it as merely part of the mysterious \"establishment\" - and not really independent, or free, at all.</p><p>Nevertheless, it ought to be a matter of national shame that in this year's World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders, the UK has fallen to number 40 in the global rankings, below the likes of Ghana, Lithuania, Uruguay and Jamaica. We are one of the worst performing countries in Western Europe.</p><p>Among other things, the fall takes into account proposals to replace the Official Secrets Act with new legislation that might see journalists penalised for obtaining leaked information; as well as threats from ministers to limit the use of encryption tools such as WhatsApp; and restrictions placed on journalists' access to political campaigns during the 2017 general election.</p><p>It should go without saying that the media must be accountable for its actions. There have been times in the past when some sections of the press failed to meet their ethical and legal responsibilities, as became clear during the Leveson inquiry and associated legal claims over phone hacking.</p><p>It's also true that journalists and editors sometimes make misjudgements and mistakes. Just yesterday, The Times was been rebuked over its story of last year that alleged Tower Hamlets council had placed a Christian child with Muslim foster parents, to the child's detriment.</p><p>Yet the media continues to expose wrongdoing and to raise awareness of important issues daily - from the Windrush scandal to antisemitism in the Labour Party; and from tax-avoidance schemes to widespread sexual abuse of children in towns such as Rotherham.</p><p>Thanks to changing consumer habits, and to the dominance of big tech firms, such as Facebook, much of the traditional media already faces significant challenges to existing business models. In many respects, it is rising to those challenges.</p><p>But as the Reporters Without Borders rankings show, press freedom is under pressure from a political discourse in which some of the loudest voices are antagonistic.</p><p>The Data Protection Bill currently going through parliament has been used by press critics as a vehicle to promote changes to the law that could have a further, serious impact on media organisations.</p><p>Aside from raising the spectre of another time-consuming, Leveson-style inquiry into the press's use of data (no mention of big tech's use of data, mind you), amendments introduced in the Lords seek to make publishers liable for picking up both sides' costs in any data protection cases brought against them - unless the publisher agrees to be regulated by a body approved by an official panel. Such measures are not only anathema to press freedom, but also to natural justice.</p><p>Whether the amendments pass into the statute books depends on MPs. The Labour Party is committed to pushing for a Leveson-esque inquiry (despite the fact that the purpose of the bill is to update data protection laws in any event); many within the party's ranks also back the proposal to change the costs regime in privacy cases.</p><p>For those who have been on the receiving end of critical - and perhaps erroneous - media coverage, that attitude is perhaps understandable. But grudges against specific outlets could easily end up causing significant harm across the journalistic board if the amendments succeed.</p><p>Arguing for a free press is not, as some would have it, the same as arguing for a free pass. But it is time politicians from all parties - as well as those who dismiss the \"mainstream media\" as a whole because they dislike the political standpoint of a particular newspaper, or because journalists sometimes err - understood the perils of the current, anti-media narrative.</p><p>As we begin to consider what vision of Britain might emerge after EU withdrawal, now is the time to remember that press freedom is something that is integral to democracy, not an easily dismissed afterthought.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000030489179-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S63-GN11-F072-42VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 26, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Roy Blunt drew chuckles Tuesday when, at a fast-paced hearing on the integration of drones into America's airspace and economy, he asked: \"How did people react when they saw that drone coming down the street?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brian Wynne, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, responded that while the experiments have been controlled so far, \"generally speaking right now people are pretty wild about the technology.\"</p><p> \"Wild\" seemed an apt term to describe the rapid expansion of drones beyond well-known military applications, to do everything from delivering packages to directing water dumps onto forest fires to chasing criminal fugitives in the night.</p><p> This week, Blunt's hearing and an announcement expected Wednesday from Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on the companies she chose to participate in a more advanced phase of testing drones for commercial use provide a window into how fast the technology and commerce is evolving.</p><p> But red flags are going up in the air, too. Some senators expressed worry that there are no national standards on drone use, only community-based ones. Some had examples where unidentified drones interrupted critical public safety work. And Earl Lawrence, who directs the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, said that while his agency is working as fast as it can through a cumbersome regulatory process, the FAA is not sure when it will have final rules in place requiring every drone to have an ownership identification attached to it.</p><p> \"We are working as fast as we can to put together a rule for remote ID,\" Lawrence told the Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee chaired by Blunt, R-Mo.</p><p> Wynne told the senators that \"massive growth\" is coming and that since August of 2016, when the FAA put into place a small drone operators rule, more than 150,000 users have registered. Most operators now must fly under 400 feet and within line of sight in daylight, although waivers for law enforcement and other entities allow for wider use.</p><p> He offered several examples of use in those circumstances, including the Conway, Mo., volunteer fire department using a drone to survey the scene of a traffic accident in that community 160 miles southwest of St. Louis. Colorado authorities last year found two lost hikers and their dog, he said, and police in a Minnesota County used thermal cameras on a drone to find a fugitive domestic abuse suspect.</p><p> Representatives of two other industries told Blunt and other senators how they are embracing the technology.</p><p> Matthew Zuccaro, president and CEO of the Helicopter Association International, said it was an \"exciting, watershed moment.\" He said that his association, rather than seeing drones as competitors, has decided to embrace and integrate the technology, noting that helicopters today already do much of their work \u2013 from inspecting power lines to covering news \u2013 at 500 feet or below.</p><p> \"Our members are now transitioning\" from use of helicopters to drones, he said, saying that the FAA should have the same \"single, regulatory authority\" over drones as it now does with helicopters.</p><p> Todd Graetz, director of technology services for the BNSF Railway Company, explained how his company was testing the use of drones to examine tracks for safety.</p><p> \"We know that drone technologies are improving at a rapid pace, that big tech companies are investing in future drone services,\" Blunt said, adding that \"precision agriculture is aided by drone use and drones are putting eyes in places\" that people can't get to.</p><p> Blunt cited studies showing that the value of drone commerce was $40 million in the U.S. in 2012, hit $1 billion last year, and could go as high as $46 billion by 2026. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said he expects 7 million drones to be sold in the U.S. by 2020.</p><p> But Blunt, Markey and others warned that drones have another side of the cutting edge. Blunt said he was concerned about the possibility of drones of the Environmental Protection Agency - an agency that is a frequent target of his - \"flying over farmland.\"</p><p> \"Eyes in the sky could become spies in the sky,\" Markey said, adding drones have a \"Dickensian quality\" in offering \"the best of technology, and the worst of technology.\"</p><p> Both he and Sen. Jon Tester, D- Mont., cited Facebook's sale of users' personal information as an example of the latter, and warned that drones could provide the same challenges to privacy.</p><p> Tester reminded panelists that firefighters in Montana last year shut down water-carrying aircraft because an unidentified drone had come into their airspace.</p><p> \"I am a property owner that lives in rural America, and one of those damned drones is flying over my house,\" he said, speaking hypotrhetically, to the FAA administrator Lawrence. \"What tools do I have if I don't know who the hell's drone it is? Can I shoot them out of the air \u2013 is that legal?\"</p><p> \"It is not legal, sir,\" Lawrence responded, adding: \"We hope that we do not resort to shooting aircrfaft.\"</p><p> Tester shot back, rhetorically: \"What tools do I have if someone wants to do something bad to me?\"</p><p> Lawrence responded that \"you have highlighted our key struggle,\" which is the feds are still working on a system where authorities can \"follow up whether they are clueless or criminal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-1498be9076907d5483377587ad53c60b4ed232e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898F303CFBB00 NWBKGA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S95-W8Y1-DXVP-V364-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cherokee Neighbor<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

After Google was hit with a 2.42 billion-euro fine by the European Commission in June, Lynn posted &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/press-releases/open-markets-applauds-european-commissions-finding-against-google-abuse-dominance/\">https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/press-releases/open-markets-applauds-european-commissions-finding-against-google-abuse-dominance/</url>\"&gt;a congratulatory note to the regulators&lt;/a&gt; and a call for action by American anti-trust officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New America, meanwhile, has received more than $20 million since its founding in 1999 from Alphabet companies and the foundation established by Eric Schmidt. Schmidt, currently executive chairman of Alphabet, also previously served as chairman of New America's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Lynn began his &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets\">https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets</url>/\"&gt;Open Markets&lt;/a&gt; program, New America had been closely, deeply associated with technology- and market-friendly Silicon Valley progressivism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Markets &lt;a href=\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/about-us/\">https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/about-us/</url>\"&gt;took a completely different tack&lt;/a&gt;, \"researching and reporting on the political and economic dangers posed by monopolization,\" largely by technology companies. And they were good at it. They were gaining adherents with influential essays by Lynn, Lina Khan, and Matt Stoller. They'd gotten the ears of Senators &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7KZ0M0gc18\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7KZ0M0gc18</url>\"&gt;like Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; and even one of Silicon Valley's own representatives, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/ro-khanna-amazon-whole-foods/530805/?utm_source=feed\">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/ro-khanna-amazon-whole-foods/530805/?utm_source=feed</url>\"&gt;Ro Khanna&lt;/a&gt;.

(New America also has two &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; people on its board: the Atlantic Media chairman David Bradley and &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; national correspondent Jim Fallows, neither of whom contributed to this story. Fallows was the chairman of the New America board from its founding until 2008, when Schmidt took over.

What happened next is what's up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article says that Schmidt saw the June note Lynn posted to the New America website and \"communicated his displeasure\" to Slaughter. The statement came down, then went back up without explanation. A few days later, Slaughter asked to meet with Lynn, and-somehow-it was decided his group would leave New America. She then sent him an email that he shared with the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote that the email said \"the decision was 'in no way based on the content of your work,'\" but but also noted that \"Slaughter accused Lynn of 'imperiling the institution as a whole.'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; leaves out the context of the \"imperiling\" remark, a plain reading of the excerpts-and the fact that the email was sent at all-suggests a leader panicked about the loss of the institution's most important constellation of funders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the story broke, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SlaughterAM/status/902874942433263616\">https://twitter.com/SlaughterAM/status/902874942433263616</url>\"&gt;Slaughter said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, \"This story is false. New America will issue statement shortly. We are proud of Open Markets work.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slaughter's longer statement emphasized that the spin-out was occasioned by Lynn's \"repeated refusal to adhere to New America's standards of openness and institutional collegiality,\" which is how educated people say, \"He was an asshole.\" (Neither Slaughter nor Lynn immediately replied to my request for an interview Wednesday. Nor did a representative for New America.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; New America has released&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/new-america/press-releases/interest-transparency-new-america-releases-email-correspondence-barry-lynn/\">https://www.newamerica.org/new-america/press-releases/interest-transparency-new-america-releases-email-correspondence-barry-lynn/</url>\"&gt; the full text of three emails from Slaughter to Lynn&lt;/a&gt;. A charitable reading of Slaughter's position is that it was not Lynn's work itself-indeed she offers to keep his team on doing their same research-but his behavior &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the presentation of his work. Slaughter tells Lynn that he's being pushed out not \"based on any response from Google\" but because of a \"pattern\" of \"telling me one thing and doing another.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, Google disputed that it had anything to do with Open Markets leaving New America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it all sounds like an inside-baseball Washington-power story, that's because it is. But that doesn't make it unimportant. This is one way that the future of the nation's economy is being decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Alphabet, Amazon, and others are treated as special entities, regular old companies, or monopolists is a key factor in determining what the internet will look like in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside&gt;The story comes at a time when Alphabet's influence, in particular, is under intense scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal used research from the &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://googletransparencyproject.org/articles/google-academics-inc\">http://googletransparencyproject.org/articles/google-academics-inc</url>\"&gt;Google Transparency Project&lt;/a&gt;, a lobbying group funded by Alphabet's competitors, to run a splashy story on Google buying \"&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286</url>\"&gt;academic influence&lt;/a&gt;.\" Journalists have noted that tech companies, after ignoring Washington for years, have been &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inc.com/business-insider/top-17-tech-companies-government-lobby-spending.html\">https://www.inc.com/business-insider/top-17-tech-companies-government-lobby-spending.html</url>\"&gt;spending as much as or more on lobbying&lt;/a&gt; than anybody else. Hundreds of Googlers have &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/29/google_transparency_project/\">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/29/google_transparency_project/</url>\"&gt;gone into or come out of the government&lt;/a&gt;, too, in one of the better examples of the old \"revolving door\" between corporate and government work.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which makes the undisputed facts of the case enough to tell the story. Maybe Eric Schmidt sent Anne-Marie Slaughter an email or a text message saying, \"WTF?\" with a link to Lynn's post. Or even just an email with the link. But even if he didn't, is anyone to believe that the institutional apparatus of New America would not be aware that one of its units was directly targeting the business model of a major funder and allied entity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with just the dumb facts of the money involved, one might imagine that Lynn's time at New America would come to a close, sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of Silicon Valley money and Washington money are so different that the introduction of the former into the latter is almost comical. You've got companies amassing tens of billions of dollars in cash with mechanics that are linked to particular regulatory and tax regimes. And those regimes are held up by people who measure donations in the tens or hundreds of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a key component of what Robert Reich (a decade ago) called &lt;em&gt;supercapitalism&lt;/em&gt;. Many times the most efficient way to make money is to change the rules governing how that money can be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Supercapitalism has not stopped at the artificial boundary separating economics from politics. The goal of the modern corporation-goaded by consumers and investors-is to do whatever is necessary to gain competitive advantage,\" Reich wrote. \"That includes entering any battleground where such gains can be made. Washington-and other capital cities around the world where public policies are devised-has become a competitive battleground because public policies often help some companies or industries while putting rivals at a comparative disadvantage.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one of the best ways to change (or freeze) policy making and regulation is to change the conversations that people are having in Washington, D.C., through funding research at think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Alphabet were Monsanto or General Motors or Pfizer, most people probably wouldn't even feign surprise. But for many years, just the word Google conferred a special halo on otherwise anodyne projects. They were the standard-bearers for &lt;i&gt;the future&lt;/i&gt; and were afforded a generosity of intention that no other company received. But no matter the color of its logo, Alphabet's money is green, too, and it exerts the same power as anyone else's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of how this all happened &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; significant for the individuals involved.

After Google was hit with a 2.42 billion-euro fine by the European Commission in June, Lynn posted       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/press-releases/open-markets-applauds-european-commissions-finding-against-google-abuse-dominance/\">a congratulatory note to the regulators</url> and a call for action by American anti-trust officials.</p><p><br/>New America, meanwhile, has received more than $20 million since its founding in 1999 from Alphabet companies and the foundation established by Eric Schmidt. Schmidt, currently executive chairman of Alphabet, also previously served as chairman of New America's board.<br/>Before Lynn began his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/\">Open Markets</url> program, New America had been closely, deeply associated with technology- and market-friendly Silicon Valley progressivism.<br/>Open Markets       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/about-us/\">took a completely different tack</url>, \"researching and reporting on the political and economic dangers posed by monopolization,\" largely by technology companies. And they were good at it. They were gaining adherents with influential essays by Lynn, Lina Khan, and Matt Stoller. They'd gotten the ears of Senators       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7KZ0M0gc18\">like Elizabeth Warren</url> and even one of Silicon Valley's own representatives,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/ro-khanna-amazon-whole-foods/530805/?utm_source=feed\">Ro Khanna</url>. Some have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/benwikler/status/902891783172042752\">given them credit</url> for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16021844/antitrust-better-deal\">anti-monopoly plank in the Democrats' platform</url>. (New America also has two Atlantic people on its board: the Atlantic Media chairman David Bradley and The Atlantic national correspondent Jim Fallows, neither of whom contributed to this story. Fallows was the chairman of the New America board from its founding until 2008, when Schmidt took over. New America's CEO, Anne-Marie Slaughter,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/anne-marie-slaughter/?utm_source=feed\">has written for this magazine</url>.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/antimonopoly-big-business/514358/?utm_source=feed\">As have Lynn</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matt-stoller/?utm_source=feed\">Matt Stoller</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/cities-economic-fates-diverge/417372/?utm_source=feed\">Phillip Longman</url> of the Open Markets team. And we've       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/democratic-party-out-of-touch-obama-wall-street-speech/524784/?utm_source=feed\">cited</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/when-exactly-does-amazon-become-a-monopoly/530616/?utm_source=feed\">Open Markets work</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/ro-khanna-amazon-whole-foods/530805/?utm_source=feed\">repeatedly</url> in our coverage.)<br/>Soon, Open Markets-and its staff of 10-will be spun out of New America and will stand on its own.<br/>Those are the well-established public facts. What happened next is what's up for debate.<br/>The Times article says that Schmidt saw the June note Lynn posted to the New America website and \"communicated his displeasure\" to Slaughter. The statement came down, then went back up without explanation. A few days later, Slaughter asked to meet with Lynn, and-somehow-it was decided his group would leave New America. She then sent him an email that he shared with the Times.<br/>The Times wrote that the email said \"the decision was 'in no way based on the content of your work,'\" but but also noted that \"Slaughter accused Lynn of 'imperiling the institution as a whole.'\"<br/>While the Times leaves out the context of the \"imperiling\" remark, a plain reading of the excerpts-and the fact that the email was sent at all-suggests a leader panicked about the loss of the institution's most important constellation of funders.<br/>Shortly after the story broke,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SlaughterAM/status/902874942433263616\">Slaughter said on Twitter</url>, \"This story is false. New America will issue statement shortly. We are proud of Open Markets work.\"<br/>Slaughter's longer statement emphasized that the spin-out was occasioned by Lynn's \"repeated refusal to adhere to New America's standards of openness and institutional collegiality,\" which is how educated people say, \"He was an asshole.\" (Neither Slaughter nor Lynn immediately replied to my request for an interview Wednesday. Nor did a representative for New America.)<br/>Update: New America has released      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/new-america/press-releases/interest-transparency-new-america-releases-email-correspondence-barry-lynn/\">the full text of three emails from Slaughter to Lynn</url>. A charitable reading of Slaughter's position is that it was not Lynn's work itself-indeed she offers to keep his team on doing their same research-but his behavior around the presentation of his work. Slaughter tells Lynn that he's being pushed out not \"based on any response from Google\" but because of a \"pattern\" of \"telling me one thing and doing another.\"<br/>In the Times, Google disputed that it had anything to do with Open Markets leaving New America.<br/>If it all sounds like an inside-baseball Washington-power story, that's because it is. But that doesn't make it unimportant. This is one way that the future of the nation's economy is being decided.<br/>Whether Alphabet, Amazon, and others are treated as special entities, regular old companies, or monopolists is a key factor in determining what the internet will look like in the coming years.<br/>The story comes at a time when Alphabet's influence, in particular, is under intense scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal used research from the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://googletransparencyproject.org/articles/google-academics-inc\">Google Transparency Project</url>, a lobbying group funded by Alphabet's competitors, to run a splashy story on Google buying \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286\">academic influence</url>.\" Journalists have noted that tech companies, after ignoring Washington for years, have been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inc.com/business-insider/top-17-tech-companies-government-lobby-spending.html\">spending as much as or more on lobbying</url> than anybody else. Hundreds of Googlers have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/29/google_transparency_project/\">gone into or come out of the government</url>, too, in one of the better examples of the old \"revolving door\" between corporate and government work.<br/>All of which makes the undisputed facts of the case enough to tell the story. Maybe Eric Schmidt sent Anne-Marie Slaughter an email or a text message saying, \"WTF?\" with a link to Lynn's post. Or even just an email with the link. But even if he didn't, is anyone to believe that the institutional apparatus of New America would not be aware that one of its units was directly targeting the business model of a major funder and allied entity?<br/>Working with just the dumb facts of the money involved, one might imagine that Lynn's time at New America would come to a close, sooner or later.<br/>The scale of Silicon Valley money and Washington money are so different that the introduction of the former into the latter is almost comical. You've got companies amassing tens of billions of dollars in cash with mechanics that are linked to particular regulatory and tax regimes. And those regimes are held up by people who measure donations in the tens or hundreds of thousands.<br/>This is a key component of what Robert Reich (a decade ago) called supercapitalism. Many times the most efficient way to make money is to change the rules governing how that money can be made.<br/>\"Supercapitalism has not stopped at the artificial boundary separating economics from politics. The goal of the modern corporation-goaded by consumers and investors-is to do whatever is necessary to gain competitive advantage,\" Reich wrote. \"That includes entering any battleground where such gains can be made. Washington-and other capital cities around the world where public policies are devised-has become a competitive battleground because public policies often help some companies or industries while putting rivals at a comparative disadvantage.\"<br/>And one of the best ways to change (or freeze) policy making and regulation is to change the conversations that people are having in Washington, D.C., through funding research at think tanks.<br/>If Alphabet were Monsanto or General Motors or Pfizer, most people probably wouldn't even feign surprise. But for many years, just the word Google conferred a special halo on otherwise anodyne projects. They were the standard-bearers for the future and were afforded a generosity of intention that no other company received. But no matter the color of its logo, Alphabet's money is green, too, and it exerts the same power as anyone else's.<br/>The details of how this all happened are significant for the individuals involved. But for the country at large, outside Washington policy circles, the essence of the story will remain the same: At some number of millions, even the invisible, digital kind of money takes on a tremendous weight. No matter where it falls, or even could potentially fall, it shapes the structures of power.<br/>Which might just be the point that the Open Markets program has been trying to make.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-thedumbfactofgooglemoney538458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGC-8TB1-DYY9-J08D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

As a result, newspapers\u2019 online audience growth does not produce revenue to match. According to data from Pew, newspaper advertising revenue fell from $22 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2016 even as web traffic for the top 50 U.S. newspapers increased 42 percent.</p><p>Local news is most at risk.

Prominent among these is the EARN IT Act[1] (the Act), a bipartisan proposal to create a new national commission responsible for proposing best practices designed to mitigate the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. The Act's proposal is seemingly simple, but its fallout would be anything but.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act currently provides online services like Facebook and Google with a robust protection from liability that could arise as a result of the behavior of their users. Under the Act, this liability immunity would be conditioned on compliance with 'best practices' that are produced by the new commission and adopted by Congress. </p><p>Supporters of the Act believe[2] that the best practices are necessary in order to ensure that platform companies effectively police CSAM. While critics of the Act assert[3] that it is merely a backdoor for law enforcement to achieve its long-sought[4] goal of defeating strong encryption.The truth of EARN IT\u2014and how best to police CSAM\u2014is more complicated. Ultimately, Congress needs to be very careful not to exceed its institutional capabilities by allowing the new commission to venture into areas beyond its (and Congress's) expertise. More can be done about illegal conduct online On its face, conditioning Section 230's liability protections on certain platform conduct is not necessarily objectionable. There is undoubtedly some abuse of services online, and it is also entirely possible that the incentives for finding and policing CSAM are not perfectly aligned with other conflicting incentives private actors face. It is, of course, first the responsibility of the government to prevent crime, but it is also consistent with past practice[5] to expect private actors to assist such policing when feasible.By the same token, an immunity shield is necessary in some form to facilitate user generated communications and content at scale. Certainly in 1996 (when Section 230 was enacted), firms facing conflicting liability standards required some degree of immunity in order to launch their services. Today, the control of runaway liability remains important as billions of user interactions take place on platforms daily. Related, the liability shield also operates as a way to promote good samaritan self-policing\u2014a measure that surely helps avoid actual censorship by governments, as opposed to the spurious claims[6] made by those like Senator Hawley.In this context, the Act is ambiguous. It creates a commission composed of a fairly wide cross-section of interested parties\u2014from law enforcement, to victims, to platforms, to legal and technical experts\u2014to recommend best practices. That hardly seems a bad thing, as more minds considering how to design a uniform approach to controlling CSAM would be beneficial\u2014at least theoretically.In practice, however, there are real pitfalls to imbuing any group of such thinkers\u2014especially ones selected by political actors\u2014with an actual or de facto final say over such practices. Much of this domain will continue to be mercurial, the rules necessary for one type of platform may not translate well into general principles, and it is possible that a public board will make recommendations that quickly tax Congress's institutional limits. To the extent possible, Congress should be looking at ways to encourage private firms to work together to develop best practices in light of their unique knowledge about their products and their businesses.In fact, Facebook has already begun experimenting[7] with an analogous idea in its recently announced Oversight Board. There, Facebook is developing a governance structure by giving the Oversight Board the ability to review content moderation decisions on the Facebook platform.So far as the commission created by the Act works to create best practices that align the incentives of firms with the removal of CSAM, it has a lot to offer. Yet, a better solution than the Act would be for Congress to establish policy that works with the private processes already in development.Short of a more ideal solution, it is critical, however, that the Act establish the boundaries of the commission's remit very clearly and keep it from venturing into technical areas outside of its expertise. The complicated problem of encryption (and technology) The Act has a major problem insofar as the commission has a fairly open ended remit to recommend best practices, and this liberality can ultimately result in dangerous unintended consequences.The Act only calls for two out of nineteen members to have some form of computer science background. A panel of non-technical experts should not design any technology\u2014encryption or otherwise.To be sure, there are some interesting proposals to facilitate access to encrypted materials (notably, multi-key escrow systems[8] and self-escrow[9]). But such recommendations are beyond the scope of what the commission can responsibly proffer.If Congress proceeds with the Act, it should put an explicit prohibition in the law preventing the new commission from recommending rules that would interfere with the design of complex technology, such as by recommending that encryption be weakened to provide access to law enforcement, mandating particular network architectures, or modifying the technical details of data storage.Congress is right to consider if there is better policy to be had for aligning the incentives of the platforms with the deterrence of CSAM\u2014including possible conditional access to Section 230's liability shield.But just because there is a policy balance to be struck between policing CSAM and platform liability protection doesn't mean that the new commission is suited to vetting, adopting and updating technical standards - it clearly isn't. Conversely, to the extent that encryption and similarly complex technologies could be subject to broad policy change it should be through an explicit and considered democratic process, and not as a by-product of the Act. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20Congresshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20Congresshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20Congresshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20CongressThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20Congresshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20Congresshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20Congresshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F14%2Fthe-earn-it-act-and-the-institutional-limits-of-congress%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Earn%20IT%20Act%20and%20the%20Institutional%20Limits%20of%20CongressThe</url> post The Earn IT Act and the Institutional Limits of Congress[10] appeared first on Truth on the Market[11].

This one is called the 'Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act of 2020' or 'EARN IT Act of 2020' and it's being led by Sens. Graham and Blumenthal. </p><p>The EARN IT Act is twice as bad as the other Section 230 reform bills because it's a two-fer: not only would it undermine Section 230, but it could destabilize the decades-old encryption policy wars. As has become typical for Section 230 reform bills, it takes thousands of words (4k+ in the case of this blog post) to explain the bill and sketch out its worst problems. You'll want a fresh cup of coffee before settling into this post. About the Drafts A first draft of the bill leaked in late January[1]. Most of the initial commentary focused on that version. A subsequent draft circulated privately in early February. I'm not aware of that version being publicly posted, and I haven't gotten authorization to post it. Nevertheless, I'm writing my blog post in reference to the second draft. There appear to be some important changes in the second draft, some of which I'll flag below. It's possible/probable that the bill will see further changes when it's officially introduced. Nomenclature note: the bill targets what we historically called 'child pornography.' The bill uses the phrase 'online child sexual exploitation material,' but to its discredit, the bill never defines that term. A more modern and possibly more expansive term for 'child pornography' is 'child sexual abuse material[2].' This post uses the acronym 'CSAM' to describe this category of content. What the Bill Says Creating a New Commission The law would create a new commission called the 'National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention,' consisting of the following members: US DOJ AG or designee, who will act as Commission chairperson Homeland Security Secretary or designee FTC Chair or designee 2 law enforcement representatives 2 prosecutors 2 representatives of NGOs 'providing services for victims of online child sexual exploitation' 2 technologists 2 representatives of large Internet services with 30M+ monthly registered U.S. users ['registered' isn't defined in the statute, and it's much more restrictive than the more typical 'monthly average user'/MAU metric. For example, I doubt Wikipedia, one of the top 10 most-trafficked websites, would qualify for this standard.] 2 representatives of small Internet services with &lt;10M monthly registered U.S. users 1 representative with 'experience in consumer protection matters related to privacy and data security representing civil society or public interest organizations.' Note: this adds up to 16 spots, though the bill says the commission has 15 members. The last bullet, the privacy expert spot, was added in the most recent redline. It appears the drafters intended to expand the commission to 16 but failed to update the number from 15. To mitigate partisan bias, of the seats other than the first three, 3 would be appointed by the Senate Majority Leader, 3 by the Senate Minority Leader, 3 by the House Speaker, and 3 by the House Minority (note the continuing math problem with 15 vs. 16 seats). I don't really understand how these folks will divvy up the rights to designate seats; and many of the positions seem like they should be inherently nonpartisan. The Commission's Charge In __ months (a placeholder says 18), 'the Commission shall develop and submit to the Attorney General recommended best practices that providers of interactive computer services may choose to engage in to prevent the online sexual exploitation of children and reduce the proliferation of online child sexual exploitation material.' (I put 'best' in quotes due to the Commission's procedural defects, which aren't likely to yield 'best' practices). The bill enumerates 11 specific topics for the 'best' practices to address. The 'best' practices are supposed to reflect the nature of different services, including that some services publish content to the public, and consider costs/technical limits as well as impacts on competition and privacy. Nothing is supposed to compel services to look for CSAM. Any Commission vote requires 11 yes votes. The Commission is supposed to update its work every 2 years. In the first draft, the Commission's reporta went to the AG, who could do whatever he wanted with it. It even appeared that the AG could substitute in his own 'best' practices for the Commission's recommendations (the prior draft said the AG could unilaterally 'modify' the recommendations). I believe the second draft changes this. It now reads that 'the Attorney General, upon agreement with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, shall approve or deny the recommended best practices.' The revised language is better than giving the AG carte blanche, but still, how will this work? Will this require unanimity among the 3? Majority (2 of 3)? Does the AG have the final say but must consult? In a later paragraph, the bill says 'Any denial of the recommended best practices by the Attorney General under paragraph (1) shall be accompanied by public written findings setting forth the basis for, and reasons supporting, the denial.' This seems to imply that the AG has unilateral rejection authority, but my instinct is that the latter provision didn't get properly refreshed in the second draft and should be updated to reflect the triumvirate decision-making. Otherwise, the provisions don't seem to cohere. Note: it's terrible committee design to have the decision-makers of the committee's work product (AG, DHS, FTC) also participate as voting committee members. Other committee members are going to be reluctant to speak in opposition to, or vote against, the final approvers because of the likely futility. This increases the odds that the Commission will just whitewash the agendas of the final approvers. Also new to the second draft: The approved 'best' practices automatically go into effect 90 days after Congress is notified of them, though Congress can disapprove them. 90 days sounds like an unreasonably turnaround time for Internet services to change their practices, especially complex services run by a small number of employees. That reminds me a little of the mad (and extremely expensive) scramble that the CCPA's too-quick go-live date caused for California businesses-except this process is scheduled to repeat itself every two years with a potentially constant flow of significant new obligations. During this 90 day period, Congress may be hold hearings and vote to disapprove, so the mad scramble may be wasted effort. A better design would give a longer phase-in period that commences only after all approvals/disapprovals have been completed. Furthermore, getting Congress to do anything in 90 days seems impractical, especially in light of the incredibly and unusually specific Congressional disapproval process spelled out in the bill. The second draft added about 10 pages (about 1/3 of the total bill length) containing highly technical and detailed procedures governing Congressional disapproval. For example, the way I'm reading it, in the House, only the majority or minority leader can introduce a disapproval motion; other Congressmembers can't. These hoops make it even more challenging for Congress to ever disapprove any Commission decisions. That's likely a feature to the bill drafters, who seemed not to want Congress to disapprove any Commission decisions. Certification of 'Best' Practices Every year, an Internet service can self-certify compliance with the approved 'best' practices. If the DOJ believes a certification is false, it can send a C.I.D. The person who signs a false self-certification can be criminally prosecuted. Good luck finding a corporate officer who wants to sign that certification! Section 230 Amendments Like FOSTA, the bill curtails Section 230 to allow new civil and state criminal claims: civil claims pursuant to 18 USC 2255 or state law for activity that violates 18 USC 2252 or 2252A (which cover CSAM distribution or receipt) or 2255(a)(2) (which appears to be a typo; 2255(a) doesn't have any subparts). The law reduces the requisite scienter in the underlying statutes from 'knowing' to 'reckless' violation. any state criminal prosecutions for conduct that violates 18 USC 2252 or 2252A The bill allows Internet services to 'earn' back a safe harbor to this newly exposed liability by maintaining a current 'best' practices certification on file with the DOJ or by adopting other 'reasonable measuresto prevent the use of the interactive computer service for the exploitation of minors.' It's hard to imagine why any service would rely on door #2. The legal standard is exceptionally vague ('exploitation of minors'). Also, much like the DMCA's safe harbor helped reconfigure how courts think about the prima facie elements of secondary copyright infringement, courts are likely to reference the Commission's 'best' practices when defining what constitutes reasonable measures. The bill could say that courts shouldn't consider the 'best' practices when determining reasonable measures, but doesn't. The Section 230 amendments take effect the earlier of 1 year after the 'best' practices become effective or __ years (4 is the current placeholder). This is a poison pill of sorts. It ensures the Section 230 scaleback will happen even if no 'best' practices are effective. That could happen because the Commission never agrees on recommendations, the AG/approvers never approve the recommendations, or Congress disapproves the 'best' practices. If no 'best' practices are approved in 4 years, the only applicable 'safe' harbor will be the 'reasonable measures' language, which isn't defined and will require development of a brand new body of common law. If we don't actually believe that Internet services can confidently rely on the 'reasonable measures' safe harbor, the Section 230 carveback's automatic implementation will cause additional avoidable chaos. An easy fix would be to implement the carveback on the LATER of 4 years or 1 year after 'best' practices adoption, but I suspect the poison pill was intentional. Like FOSTA, the bill nominally retains the Section 230(c)(2)(A) defense. During the SESTA-FOSTA debates, I explained to Congress why that defense is meaningless[3]. (I even proposed suggested language to make it meaningful!). One of several reasons: 230(c)(2)(A) isn't likely to protect trying-and-failing, and that's the likely grounds for any newly tenable EARN IT Act claims. Expanded Reporting Safe Harbor Existing law requires Internet services to report known instances of CSAM to NCMEC. A safe harbor, 18 USC 2258B, insulates them from liability for making these legally obligated reports. The bill would expand and clarify the 2258B safe harbor to include compliance with search warrants/court orders or voluntary research to combat CSAM or reporting. It would be remarkable if anyone feels safe relying on this safe harbor to conduct CSAM research-it's an extremely hazardous area of study. Problems with the Bill (Selected) I've already mentioned a few tactical problems with the bill above, and I could spend many thousands more words on structural problems with this bill. Instead, I'll highlight 'just' 6 of the many big problems. Section 230 Already Doesn't Apply to CSAM, So Removing Section 230 Won't Motivate Internet Services to Fight CSAM Harder The EARN It Act implicitly assumes that Section 230 currently inhibits Internet services from combating CSAM more aggressively. Otherwise, why condition Section 230 on the services doing more? (I'll address more cynical explanations shortly). Unfortunately, this makes no sense. Due to several attributes that are unique to CSAM compared to other types of awful content, fighting CSAM already gets the highest levels of attention from virtually all Internet services: Section 230 does not apply to federal criminal prosecutions, so Internet services have never had Section 230 immunity for federal CSAM crimes. That exposure helps motivate Internet services to combat CSAM. Indeed, the US DOJ actively prosecutes CSAM cases-2,776 cases in 2013[4]-so Internet services won't gamble on underenforcement. As already mentioned, Internet services must report known CSAM items to NCMEC (18 U.S.C. \u202f2258A). Congress expanded the 2258A reporting obligation in 2018. The statutory expansion possibly explains the N.Y. Times'[5] 2019 breathless panic that CSAM reports had doubled in the past year. Due to the 2258A reporting duty, many Internet services have designated employees responsible for redressing CSAM, which ensures that Internet services pay more attention to CSAM than other types of awful content. CSAM is the paradigmatic example of awful content that can be identified based solely by examining the content itself, without any additional context. This makes CSAM the ideal case for automated filtering. Over a decade ago, Microsoft developed an automated filter, PhotoDNA[6], which it now makes freely available to other industry participants. Thus, unlike many other types of awful content, a non-proprietary CSAM automated filter is already widely adopted across the industry. Virtually all Internet services consider CSAM the most pernicious type of user-supplied content and already apply zero-tolerance policies. It's laughable to imply that Internet services are blase about CSAM on their networks. Of course Internet services could do more to suppress awful content generally, but those steps aren't specific to CSAM and are likely to affect wide swathes of legitimate UGC. In sum, in light of the anti-CSAM efforts already being deployed, exactly what new anti-CSAM steps will be motivated by the removal of Section 230 immunity? The EARN IT Act appears to be motivated more by other considerations, not actually helping combat CSAM or protecting CSAM victims. The Effects of New Civil and State Criminal Liability Are Unclear Making Internet services civilly liable for 'recklessly' distributing CSAM opens up a Pandora's box of unknown consequences. Congress recently enacted the 'Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018' (18 USC 2259) to clarify, and likely expand, civil liability for CSAM. I'm not sure how that change will affect the liability of Internet services. At minimum, the 'reckless' scienter standard increases defense and adjudication costs, regardless of the claims' merit, because plaintiffs will always plead facts to claim recklessness. This would negate Section 230's critical procedural benefits[7] that currently negate expensive and time-consuming judicial inquiries into scienter. State criminal enforcement creates additional uncertainties. 20 years ago, NY AG Spitzer prosecuted an Internet access provider, BuffNET[8], for hosting USENET groups that carried CSAM from third-party non-subscribers. What should we make of that example? It implies that Section 230 has never prevented state CSAM prosecutions. At the same time, the fact that there have not been similar prosecutions in 20 years suggests that perhaps Spitzer overreached and such prosecutions not actually are appropriate or defensible. (As I've explained elsewhere[9], there are other good reasons why Section 230 prevented state prosecutors without restricting federal prosecutors). To further confound the matter, FOSTA recently opened up Section 230 for state criminal prosecutions and civil claims related to sex trafficking. As far as I know, no state prosecutors have used these new tools in the past 2 years; and civil plaintiffs only just started[10] trying in the last couple of months. Apparently, the Section 230 carveback in FOSTA didn't have an urgent pent-up demand. Will the CSAM carveback face similar dynamics? I'm not sure. Ignoring Results from Related Efforts As I've already mentioned, Congress has amended CSAM law recently, including the expanded Internet service reporting requirement and the expanded civil CSAM liability. FOSTA is also partially related. It would make sense to absorb the lessons from these policy changes. Are they already redressing the problems? If so, why do we need more laws? If not, what went wrong with the recent policy changes, and are we sure this bill will avoid their failings? In particular, the early assessments of FOSTA are horrendous[11]. It appears to have made many communities worse with no countervailing benefits to other communities. The EARN IT Act copies some of FOSTA's structure, so it seems likely to repeat some of FOSTA's errors. The Encryption Battles, Redux In December 2019, AG Barr spoke to NAAG[12] and linked together tech power, Section 230, CSAM, and encryption. It was jarring to hear AG Barr target Section 230, because the DOJ is the only entity in the world that can automatically bypass any Section 230 defenses (due to 230's federal criminal prosecution exception). Thus, the DOJ never has been restricted by Section 230 and has minimal first-hand experience with it. Indeed, the DOJ has had numerous high-profile enforcement successes unfettered by Section 230, including its 2007 $31M bust of search engines for accepting allegedly illegal gambling ads[13], its 2011 bust of Google for accepting allegedly illegal pharmaceutical ads[14] that led to a half-billion dollar payment, and the life sentence of Ross Ulbrecht for running Silk Road[15]. Instead, Barr's remarks reignite long-standing battles over encryption. Law enforcement has sought to eviscerate online encryption for at least a quarter-century. The EARN IT Act creates a new way to attack encryption, by stripping Section 230 immunity for any services deploying encryption. The Commission's composition-packed with law enforcement representatives-stokes that fear. [I'll treat 'encryption' as a binary state of either accessible or inaccessible to unintended audiences, but that's a gross oversimplification] Any 230/encryption linkage makes no sense. First, Internet services usually don't need Section 230 protection for private messages (encrypted or not) they automatically transmit. I'm not aware of a specific immunity covering this activity, but it would be hard to come up with a prima facie case where a provider of private messaging was liable for automatically processing private messages. In fact, services usually are legally blocked from examining private message contents except in specific circumstances, so those services have extremely limited tools to redress awful private message content. Thus, I'm struggling to imagine the circumstances where private message providers would stop adding their own encryption layer to private messages in fear of losing Section 230 immunity. Second, the Section 230/encryption deal won't prevent users from encrypting the private messages they send. That content will be completely opaque to the services, and it's virtually impossible to imagine how Internet services could be liable for encrypted messages. I guess the Commission could adopt a 'best' practice that Internet services must block/ban all user-encrypted content to get Section 230, but I don't know how that could work technically or why that would matter to the Internet services. Third, non-private messages generally can't be encrypted, and CSAM is rarely shared non-privately for obvious reasons. So an anti-encryption 'best' practice wouldn't reach CSAM this way either. Thus, I don't see how conditioning 230 on Internet services' dropping encryption would redress the CSAM problem. If acted upon by the Internet services, however, it would make it easier to intercept any private messages (including messages containing CSAM) that senders don't encrypt themselves. This wouldn't be restricted to CSAM; it would be an open door to intercepting messages of all flavors. And it wouldn't be restricted to U.S. law enforcement; other state actors and malefactors would be delighted to listen in as well. Thus, if the EARN IT Act links 230 to no-encryption, the Internet would become less secure for users, and more users would be motivated to encrypt their messages. There is good reason to fear that the EARN IT Act is cynically invoking CSAM as a trojan horse for discouraging encryption deployment. It just seems like the trojan horse doesn't actually solve any of its purported problems. The Commission Composition Won't Produce 'Best' Practices Beyond encryption bans, there are many other bad ideas that could emerge as 'best' practices. For example, inspired by the UK Defamation Act[16], Section 230's immunity from CSAM claims could be predicated on Internet services having validated identifying information about violating users. Such a 'best' practice would force Internet services to authenticate all users (because the services don't know in advance which one(s) will commit CSAM crimes). That would functionally eliminate anonymous online content and create a honeypot database for law enforcement, plaintiffs, and malefactors. Age authentication is another obvious vector for a bad 'best' practice. Some states already (unsuccessfully) tried to mandate age verification in the Backpage battles[17]. The Commission could create a 'best' practice for Internet services to verify the age of anyone depicted in any 'pornographic' image or video as a precondition for Section 230 immunity. Because Internet services cannot possibly do this, a 'best' practice like this would immediately eliminate most publicly available pornography on U.S. servers, whether or not constitutionally protected. Note: following Tam and Brunneti, I think it violates the First Amendment for the government to withhold a valuable privilege based on preconditions that, if promulgated as standalone obligations, would violate the First Amendment. So I offer up some bad 'best' practices without opining whether those practices could survive a constitutional challenge. Even if the Commission doesn't try to adopt terrible 'best' practices, I don't expect any approved practices actually will be 'best' for the Internet due to the Commission's composition. Recall that 6 'no' votes will be required to stop any proposal. The Internet services get 4 seats total, so they alone cannot spike any bad ideas. Furthermore, the Internet services aren't likely to agree with each other isn't high. In particular, big Internet services embrace regulatory requirements that thwart their competition and entrench their positions. That's why Facebook keeps begging for government regulation (Zuckerberg just did it again this weekend[18]). Accordingly, the big Internet services may not oppose any costly/onerous law enforcement proposals that hurts their competition. The bill's nod to competitive concerns won't inhibit this dynamic at all One obvious omission from the Commission's composition: advocates for free speech or users who aren't disseminating CSAM, because those interests will surely be overridden by the Commission's recommendations. Even when the large and small Internet service representatives vote with each other, they'll struggle to shape the recommendations. Law enforcement has 7 votes, and the 2 NGO votes will inevitably side with law enforcement. That leaves only 3 votes up for grabs to assemble the necessary 11 yes or 6 no votes: the technologists and the privacy representative. We shouldn't assume the technologists will side with the Internet companies. Many technologists are pro-censorship. The privacy representative's predispositions are also hard to anticipate: they may be skeptical of efforts to undermine encryption, but privacy advocates often favor regulating Internet services. Due to the voting structure, I expectthe Commission will recommend 'best' practices that are pernicious for Internet services and all their users. Section 230 Shouldn't Be a 'Privilege' to be Earned It has become a popular DC meme to view Section 230 as a 'payoff' for doing something the regulators want. This regulatory approach treats the loss of Section 230 immunity as the consequence of noncompliance with the regulators' demands. However, without Section 230, many Internet services will be overrun by litigation and go out of business-an outcome that typically will be disproportionate to the associated legal violation. If Congress affirmatively wants Internet services to do something, they should mandate it directly-and create just and proportionate remedies for any violation-without otherwise modifying Section 230. The 'Principles' Last year, 53 academics and 28 organizations issued a statement of 7 principles[19] to evaluate new revisions to Section 230. There's so much wrong with this bill, I didn't need to run through the 7 principles to find the problems. I encourage you to do the exercise yourself FWIW. Selected Other Commentary Emma Llanso, 'Privacy, Free Expression, and Security Threatened by Graham Proposal[20]': 'Preventing the exploitation of children is an unquestionably important aim. However, there is little evidence that Section 230, which protects intermediaries such as website operators from liability for the information their users post, is a barrier to those efforts.' Riana Pfefferkorn, 'The EARN IT Act: How to Ban End-to-End Encryption Without Actually Banning It[21]': 'This bill is trying to convert your anger at Big Tech into law enforcement's long-desired dream of banning strong encryption. It is a bait-and-switch. Don't fall for it.' Berin Szoka, 'Lindsey Graham's Sneak Attack On Section 230 And Encryption: A Backdoor To A Backdoor?[22]': The bill is a 'monstrous, Rube-Goldberg-esque legal contraption.' Alan Rozenshtein, 'Congress, Not the Attorney General, Should Decide the Future of Encryption[23]': 'the question of whether to permit ubiquitous encryption is the sort of high-level policy decision that is best handled not by the executive branchbut by Congress, which best represents the public and its different constituencies and interests.' Mark Rasch, 'Bill to Prevent Child Porn Could Kill Encryption[24]': the law 'may have the effect of prohibiting the kinds of good security practices that prevent unauthorized access to medical records, credit card records, bank records and other personal information, and may make the internet a hell of a lot less secure.' The EFF asks you to take action against the EARN IT Act[25]. Conclusion What is it about Section 230 that it attracts such dreadful reform proposals? FOSTA has been an unmitigated disaster; Sen. Hawley[26] and Rep. Gosar's[27] bills full-throatedly embrace censorship; the PLAN Act[28] is pure rent-seeking by hotels; and then this bill comes along. These reforms aren't just terrible; they encapsulate everything that's broken in Congress today. The EARN IT Act shares a common philosophy with the UK Online Harms proposal. In both cases, to combat awful online content, the government helps develop a set of industry-wide standards that are the only viable path to avoiding ruinous liability. See my critique of the UK Online Harms proposal[29]. I characterized the UK Online Harms proposal as one of the most enthusiastically pro-censorship proposals to come from an industrialized Western country. The EARN IT Act is a close second.

This history of the decline of social democracy comes from a vantage that might strike readers as novel: that of economic policy and how that played out in politics. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website[1] Social democracy, the political force that shaped post-1945 Western Europe more than any other political movement, is in terminal decline\u2014or so it appears. </p><p>In recent years, in European country after country, voter support for social-democratic parties has collapsed. In France, Greece and the Netherlands social democrats hold less than 10 percent of the seats in parliament. In Germany and Italy, social-democratic parties are at a historic low. Britain's Labour Party's last electoral win dates back to 2005\u2014 half a generation ago. The result has been a remarkable, steady decline in the political relevance and influence of Europe's social-democratic parties. The long-run decline of electoral support for social democracy reflects a failure of social-democratic parties in Europe to strike a convincing and effective balance between 'short-term practical relevance' and 'progressive, egalitarian reformism' (Bhaduri 1993). This paper[2] argues that this failure originates in a flawed macroeconomic thinking. Short-term practical relevance requires social democracy to accept, at least partly, the very socio-economic and political conditions of 'really-existing capitalism' which it purports to change in the longer run. Once social democrats chose to work within the rules of capitalism, they had to abandon their radical goal of systemic transformation and commit themselves to maintain private property in the means of production. After all, the capitalist class has the power to block any egalitarian transformation of the property-rights and economic system by sharply reducing firm investment, which, in turn, reduces demand and employment in the short run and has negative impacts on long-run growth as well. Hence, working within the capitalist system creates an inescapable dilemma for social democracy: its policies must at the same time strengthen the productive power of capital and counteract the (political) power of capitalists. Through the state, social democrats had to assure capitalism's efficiency and the growth of its productive capabilities, while at the same time mitigating adverse distributional effects. Phase I (1950-1975): Co-Operative Capitalism, Partly Enabled by 'Wage-Led' Demand The Keynesian revolution in macroeconomics led to a drastic reorientation of European social democratic thinking: away from the revolutionary 'nationalization of the means of production' to the 'nationalization of consumption', as Swedish economist Bertil Ohlin (1938) put it. Reformism was abandoned\u2014and capitalism accepted\u2014on the condition that it be regulated and disciplined by the state, without any need to socialize the means of production. Social democrats developed a full-fledged ideology of the 'welfare state', as the means to nationalize consumption and bring about mass-consumption-driven economic expansion. Thus, during the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesian demand management helped sustain a full employment regime, which featured high real wage growth, shortening of the working week, and the build-up of welfare states. What was critical is that the high wage growth, the shortening of the working week and welfare-state expansion did not hurt the profitability of firms. To the contrary, the 'golden age of co-operative capitalism' managed to avoid a profit squeeze, because of four factors which more than offset the negative impact of higher wages on the profit rate. First, aggregate demand was 'wage-led' (Bhaduri and Marglin 1990), which meant that higher wages led to higher demand and hence to higher capacity utilization; higher capacity utilization raised the profit rate of firms. Second, the pressure of high wages on the profit rate was reduced, because higher demand and higher utilization led to higher labour productivity through the Kaldor-Verdoorn relation. The third factor was that high wages were supported by fiscal policy intended to keep the economy (and utilization) close to full employment. The fourth and final factor was the high growth of world trade, enabled by the Bretton Woods system of stable exchange rates, and the restrictions imposed on cross-border capital mobility in most economies. Full-employment-oriented fiscal policy was the key ingredient, because it made possible (and stabilized) high productivity growth and hence high wage growth, helped by the overall wage-led nature of demand. Taken together, the four factors safeguarded adequate profit rates for firms, and thus offered a solution to the dilemma facing European social democracy. The co-operative compromise unravelled in response to the 'stagflation' of the 1970s. The reason for the breakdown was more political than economic: decades of (near) full employment had unleashed, as Micha\u026c Kalecki (1943) warned, forces which directly threatened the authority structure of capitalism\u2014forces which became manifest in growing wage pressure, heightened worker militancy, calls for more redistribution, and growing demands for a radical democratization of society, the economy and the workplace. The breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 added further fuel to stagflation, leading to heightened uncertainty for exporters, competitive exchange rate devaluations (triggered by the devaluation of the U.S. dollar), a slowing down of world trade growth, two oil-price shocks, and import-cost inflation (Halevi 2019). Demand growth declined, which in turn depressed productivity growth\u2014and this drove up the wage share even more. The 'indiscipline' of workers, the collapse of the Bretton Woods order, and the consequent 'profit squeeze' led governments to implement structural policy reform aimed at improving the 'climate' for private investment and finance. Phase II (1975-End of 1980s): Co-Operative Capitalism With 'Profit-Led' Demand The collapse of wage-led growth and the crisis of stagflation brought back, with a vengeance, the dilemma of social democracy\u2014in a profit-led system, profits must be protected from demand of the masses, because if profits are not 'sufficient', then eventually wages and/or employment must decline. Reviving private investment became the focal point of a new wave of conservatism, which, championed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, centred on wage moderation, monetarist inflation control (instead of full-employment-oriented fiscal policy), the deregulation of labour and financial markets, privatization, (corporate) tax reductions, globalization and (accompanying) military build ups, and the scaling down of 'nanny' welfare states (Halevi 2019). The stagflation seemed to prove that in an open profit-led economy, full employment demand management and radical redistributive policies are not in the material interest of wage-earners, because they result in high wages and poor international cost competitiveness, and therefore low profitability, sluggish investment and stagnation. Some social democrats internalized this lesson quickly. West-German Bundeskanzler Helmut Schmidt (1976), a leading European social democrat, articulated it in Le Monde as follows: 'The profits of enterprises today are the investments of tomorrow, and the investments of tomorrow are the employment of the day after.' Other social democrats needed more time\u2014Francois Mitterand, the social-democratic President of France, who was elected on the promise of Keynesian demand stimulus, capitulated only in 1981-83 after bond and currency markets started to protest against his - half-hearted - fiscal stimulus. Schmidt's argument won the day and became the cornerstone of the post-1970s social democratic consent of capitalism. Perhaps the clearest expression of this reorientation of social democracy within the EU is the Dutch 'Polder Model' consensus on strict real wage restraint. Dutch real wage growth was kept below productivity growth, which raised the profit share and lowered Dutch relative unit labour cost. Dutch unemployment declined steeply in the 1980s and 1990s, exactly when unemployment in other E.U. countries remained high or even increased. This way, the Dutch social democrats set the example to emulate, and from the late 1980s onwards, their European comrades followed suit, choosing to co-operate to reproduce capitalism and rather drastically tone down whatever was left of their initial reformist intentions. However, social democratic consent was still based on the common understanding that aggregate demand mattered for profits and investment. Keynesianism was not dead yet. Social democrats could continue to argue in favour of fiscal stabilization, (decent) minimum wages, collective wage bargaining, and welfare-state support for the unemployed, the disadvantaged and the elderly, because these 'Keynesian' interventions could be argued to contribute to stabilizing aggregate demand and protecting the profit rate. 'We are all Keynesians now', captured the mood in this period. Phase III (early 1990s - Now): Final Surrender to TINA Social democracy's compromise with 'profit-led' capitalism broke down in the early 1990s, under the impacts of two powerful forces. The first one was the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe. The collapse of communism deprived European social democracy from its ideological 'doppelgnger' and left it with nothing distinctive to offer, except its 'exhausted language' (Judt 2010). The second force to undermine the compromise of the 1980s, no less important than the first, was the demise of Keynesianism. The victory of Thatcher-Reagan conservatism might not have happened, as Tony Judt (2010) argued, without a supporting intellectual revolution\u2014one which succeeded in overthrowing the Keynesian consensus and turning 'government' into the problem, rather than the solution. This is the essence of the neoliberal turn in Europe's political formation: rather than entrusting the state, or the 'Staatsvolk' in Wolfgang Streeck's (2016) terminology, with the task to stabilize the unstable capitalist economy, the new conservatism relegated to deregulated (financial) markets, or Streeck's 'Marktvolk', the task to maintain the stability of the social and political order. In macroeconomics, the 'intellectual revolution' gave birth to the New Consensus Macroeconomics (NCM) in the 1980s. NCM rejected Keynesianism by arguing that the stagflation of the mid-1970s 'proved' that the Phillips-curve trade-off between inflation and unemployment could only exist in the short run, for as long as actors in the economy were wrong about (actual and expected) inflation. In the longer run, once actors had learned from experience and correctly started to anticipate the rate of inflation, the NCM claims that the Phillips Curve is vertical at a given rate of unemployment\u2014the 'natural' rate of unemployment, also known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). Accordingly, monetary policy could only affect the unemployment-inflation trade-off in the short run, but economic activity could not deviate from its 'natural' level, as determined by the NAIRU, in the long run. Likewise, fiscal policy cannot have permanent, long-run, impacts without causing unmanageable accelerating inflation, which would force the central bank to increase the interest rate. Higher interest rates would, in turn, crowd out private-sector investment\u2014and unemployment would converge back to the NAIRU. There is, in this approach, only one way to structurally raise growth and permanently reduce unemployment in a non-inflationary manner, namely imposing structural reforms on the labour market, which lower the NAIRU. This way, the NCM created the governing myth that governments and central banks should refrain from intervening actively, using fiscal and/or monetary policy instruments, to smooth short-run fluctuations or to steer the economy, but rather concentrate on creating the structural conditions for deregulated (labour) markets to grind out the 'natural' long-run equilibrium. The NCM has one profound policy message, which constitutes a radical denial of the promise of Keynesian demand management in a wage-led economy: macro-economic policy faces an inescapable trade-off between 'growth' (or 'efficiency') and 'equality'. What it means in common parlance is that any policy intervention to reduce inequality, for instance by means of labour market regulation and welfare-state redistribution, carries a welfare cost, because it raises the NAIRU and hence must lower growth. Vice versa, any attempt to permanently raise economic growth means lowering the NAIRU by deregulating the labour market and downsizing the welfare state\u2014which must raise inequality. Andrew Glyn (2006) appropriately called it the 'Nasty Trade-Off' between higher wages and more jobs\u2014or, more generally, between economic growth and egalitarianism. The death of Keynesianism left it clueless and without any effective policy levers to counteract the power of capitalists. The ideological emptiness created by the collapse of communism and the demise of Keynesianism in favour of NCM was filled by 'Third Way' pragmatic compromising, strategic rebranding and technological tinkering. The defining feature of New Labour of the 'Third Way' variety is its complete internalization of the idea that the 'Nasty Trade-Off' really exists. As a result, New Labour discarded fiscal policy activism in favour of rule-based fiscal austerity, supported the independence of central banks (in effect, handing over the levers of monetary policy to unelected and democratically unaccountable technocrats), completely submitted to 'reactionary' financial interests (of the 'Marktvolk') by endorsing central-bank inflation targeting and deregulation of financial markets, and, in doing so, lost all sense of shared purpose. Peter Mandelson's statement that 'we are all Thatcherites' captures the new mood perfectly. In the U.K., Tony Blair's 'Third Way' economic policies intended to create a business- and finance-friendly economic environment (Osler 2002)\u2014by means of the (semi-) privatization of public services, social dumping to attract foreign investors, tax cuts for the rich and social-benefit cuts for the (undeserving) poor, opting out of the European social charter, unconditional support for financial globalization, harsh law &amp;#38; order policies and deregulation of labour and financial markets, while turning a blind eye on rising income and wealth inequality. But it is not just Britain's New Labour. In the 1990s, it was widely felt that European social democracy needed a modern makeover, in order to become more market-friendly. As a result, social democracy became a conservative force, both politically and economically, in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy\u2014and most governments adopted the strategy of blaming the EU and Brussels for unpopular policy reforms, which they themselves were (covertly) favouring. Labour law reforms such as the Hartz reforms by the Schr\u00f6der government in Germany but also elsewhere, created a larger 'disposable' labour force, a flexible reserve army of the under-employed, and through this, raised (income, wealth and job) inequality in Europe. The Economic Consequences of New Labour New Labour's compromise did succeed in reducing unemployment in Europe, but it rather spectacularly failed to improve overall macroeconomic performance. Real GDP growth continued its secular stagnation\u2014notwithstanding the structural reforms introduced on New Labour's brief. The reason for the growth slowdown is ironic: as is shown by study after study, aggregate demand in these six economies is robustly 'wage-led'. This means that the New Labour strategy of wage restraint and structural reform, coupled with strict rule-based fiscal austerity (Storm 2019), which was meant to reduce the NAIRU, raise the profit rate and push up utilization, backfired. The reason: it did reduce demand and utilization and hurt both the profit rate and investment. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the report of the death of Keynesianism seems to have been an exaggeration. But the macroeconomic damage done is larger. The labour market deregulation and supply-side measures which pushed more people into the labour market were, as noted above, successful: unemployment came down and labour force participation went up, which was exactly the intention. However, it is impossible to read this as (social and/or emancipatory) progress\u2014because what it reflects on the ground is the growth of low-productivity, low-pay, generally temporary 'alternative working arrangements', mostly in private services industries\u2014arrangements which in post-Schr\u00f6der Germany are often 'mini-jobs', in Italy are all fixed-term contracts and in the Netherlands most often mean temporary self-employment. And at the macro level, the slowdown of economic growth and the increase in employment growth imply, when taken together, a decline in labour productivity growth. This slowdown of productivity growth puts welfare states under growing fiscal pressure. The stagnation of wage-led aggregate demand and the growing job and income insecurity, characteristic of the New Labour compromise, helped to undermine its political legitimacy. The rapid growth of deregulated financial markets provided policymakers with an opportunity to defer this threat by enabling a strong growth of private borrowing, by households and firms, to keep 'the show going' by sustaining demand. Crouch (2009) calls it 'privatised Keynesianism,' and its defining feature is the dramatic increase in the system's reliance on household and corporate debt to defer distributional conflicts and continue to meet the electorate's welfare expectations. The failed New Labour compromise has caused political damage as well. First, big parts of social democracy's core constituency have defected to either the more extreme Left movement or to (extreme) right-wing populist parties. There is a growing polarization in the polity\u2014with growth on the far left and even more on the far right. In Italy, France and the U.K., this polarization has already seriously destabilized the established political system\u2014to (as yet) unknown effect. Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden each have seen not just growing right-wing populism, but also a considerable shift of the political centre and 'accepted political discourse' to the right. Governing is becoming increasingly difficult under these polarized conditions. The other form of damage comes in more subtle ways: growing (income and wealth) inequalities have made class and status divisions more powerful, have considerably reduced (upward) social mobility, and strengthened residential segregation and segregation in education (Wilkinson and Pickett 2019). In contrast, in more equal societies, citizens trust each other, there is a greater willingness to help each other, and general attitudes to the social welfare state and taxation are more positive. Adam Smith (1776/1976, p. 88) put it like this: 'No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.' As inequality rises, all this goes in reverse. Seen this way, the recent collapse in support for social democracy is a largely self-inflicted wound\u2014and unprecedented act of self-destruction. What Is To Be Done? What sort of political-economy framework can the Left propose to explain its objectives and justify its goals? For a start, social democrats should discard the now discredited NCM thinking, and draw the right lesson from Keynes, namely that capitalism is inherently unstable and needs to be 'wisely managed' in order to become more efficient. Markets turned out to be 'bad masters', and now have to be turned into 'good servants'. We need social and political organization to impose stability on unruly markets, including through imposing cross-border capital controls (when and where necessary). Social democrats also have to understand that it makes no sense to let financial markets determine the fiscal capacity of the state\u2014this is a fundamentally political decision which involves matching society's levels of taxation to its social (spending) ambitions and deciding on how to finance a public deficit (in case it arises). This is not a plea for Big States, nor for maximum monetary financing, but rather for meaningful deliberative democracy in which citizens have a say in politics when and where it matters most. It is a firm plea against the de-politicization of fiscal and monetary policy as well as against the corrupting influence of political money on democracy\u2014which should have been obvious to social-democrats anyway. Second, social democrats must reject the ideology of the 'Nasty Trade-Off' for what it is: a conservative fantasy. In the European economies, higher wages and progressive income redistribution do indeed improve macro-economic performance and benefit both workers and firms, especially when supported by aggregate demand management. Social democrats ought to stand for both fair real wage increases and a credible commitment in macroeconomic policymaking to full employment (rather than low inflation)\u2014demands which do not conflict with productivity growth and profitability (if properly managed). Likewise, welfare states and protective labour market institutions must not be considered a cost and a drain, but rather constitute efficient frameworks which by helping nations to share the costs and benefits of globalization and technological progress, make firms more flexible and raise their international competitiveness. The above is by no means a covert defensive call for a return to an idealized past (e.g. the 'golden age'), but instead it is an evidence-based diagnosis of where we are and how we got there and a recognition that there are alternatives to Thatcherism. Capitalism needs to be managed, and if citizens do not do it (through the political process) than 'superstar' firms, big banks, big-tech companies and billionaires will do it for us. However, any reimagined social democracy worth the name must begin by imposing discipline on banks and financial markets\u2014and by domestication, turn them from the powerful over-lords (who they currently are) into useful servants to the societal interest. This, in turn, requires a counter-revolution in economic thinking, one which overthrows the NCM in favour of more realistic (less utopian) and more humane approaches. NCM must be seen for what it is: stale nineteenth-century pre-Keynesian thinking, a parody of an accountant's nightmare, in John Maynard Keynes' (1933) words. The global recession caused by the COVID-19 lockdown is making such a counter-revolution in economic thinking only more urgent. The current panicky 'emergency Keynesianism' which is upending decades of ruthless austerity in Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere does not come close to what is needed. Yes, governments will be paying 'for the war against COVID-19' by taking on much more debt, but once the crisis is over, higher public indebtedness will turn out to be socially unjust and economically inefficient. After all, the Pavlovian response of politicians and a majority of economists, brainwashed by modern (NCM) macroeconomic theory, is a return to fiscal austerity with a vengeance, on the argument that debts must be repaid, bringing another lost decade of ruthless spending cuts (in public investment) and structural shortages and lowered wages in exactly those services, such as health care, social support and education, which are now deemed 'essential' during the health emergency. A simple and effective, Keynesian and social democratic, alternative to fund the unprecedented public rescue packages would be much higher taxes on wealth, incomes and (rentier) finance. This way, the strongest shoulders will carry the largest burden without corroding and undermining economic growth and public health in the future. The longer-term impact of the COVID-19 recession will be chronically painful, if we do not apply the right lessons learned from earlier crises. While the virus may go away, helped by massive social distancing and the lockdown of the global economy, we must remain alert to the consequences of a longer stay or the arrival of a new mutant. To able to deal with these consequences, our crisis response now should not lock us in into a permanent state of austerity, greater inequality and heightened vulnerability to future health calamities. New-old social democratic solutions are needed more than ever before. Three comments on this essay can be found here[3].

A v Americe je v posledn\u00edch n\u011bkolika desetilet\u00edch \u010d\u00edm d\u00e1l v\u00edce zasti\u0148uj\u00ed kontroverzn\u00ed zp\u011btn\u00e9 odkupy akci\u00ed.  Pro obchodn\u00ed historiky jsou v\u0161ak dividendy \u00fapln\u00e9 drama. Jejich duchovn\u00edm domovem je Evropa, kde se zrodily jako zp\u016fsob, jak rozd\u011blit ko\u0159ist holandsk\u00fdch a britsk\u00fdch lodn\u00edch monopol\u016f v 17. stolet\u00ed. V 19. stolet\u00ed b\u011bhem \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00edho boomu zrychlily u\u017e na obou stran\u00e1ch Atlantiku, \u010dasto podl\u00fdm zp\u016fsobem tak, aby plynouc\u00ed platby p\u0159il\u00e1kaly d\u016fv\u011b\u0159iv\u00e9 investory. Hromadn\u00e9 v\u00fdplaty v bou\u0159liv\u00fdch dvac\u00e1t\u00fdch letech minul\u00e9ho stolet\u00ed pomohly k p\u00e1du Wall Street v roce 1929. Ale po krizi byly pova\u017eov\u00e1ny za nejlep\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob, jak obnovit d\u016fv\u011bru investor\u016f. To, co odhalily, kdy\u017e dorazily (anebo taky ne) akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm b\u011bhem pandemie covid-19, p\u0159id\u011blalo jejich p\u0159\u00edjemc\u016fm jen tr\u00e1pen\u00ed. Zejm\u00e9na v Evrop\u011b vlna sni\u017eov\u00e1n\u00ed dividend uk\u00e1zala, jak nemocn\u00e9 byly mnoh\u00e9 z nejpresti\u017en\u011bj\u0161\u00edch firem regionu. Dva evrop\u0161t\u00ed ropn\u00ed ob\u0159i, Royal Dutch Shell a BP, se sklonili p\u0159ed nevyhnuteln\u00fdm kolapsem cen ropy a na sv\u00e9 dividendy si rovnou vzali sekeru. Banky a \u017eivotn\u00ed poji\u0161\u0165ovny v cel\u00e9 Evrop\u011b, opora mnoha penzijn\u00edch fond\u016f s n\u00edzk\u00fdmi p\u0159\u00edjmy, pozastavily v\u00fdplaty pod tlakem finan\u010dn\u00edch regul\u00e1tor\u016f. Nezam\u011bniteln\u00fdm obrazem je k\u0159ehkost a \u00fapadek evropsk\u00e9ho korpor\u00e1tu. V Americe je to jin\u00fd p\u0159\u00edb\u011bh. Firmy tam maj\u00ed sklon up\u0159ednost\u0148ovat zp\u011btn\u00fd odkup akci\u00ed. Nap\u0159\u00edklad v lo\u0148sk\u00e9m roce vyplatily nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed americk\u00e9 spole\u010dnosti v pr\u016fm\u011bru 41 % zisku v dividend\u00e1ch. Srovnateln\u00e9 evropsk\u00e9 firmy vyplatily 66 %. Akcie pro zp\u011btn\u00fd odkup ale tvo\u0159ily 59 %, resp. 23 %. Jedn\u00edm z d\u016fvod\u016f t\u00e9to preference je, \u017ee podle americk\u00fdch pravidel je odkup akci\u00ed da\u0148ov\u011b efektivn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob, jak akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm vr\u00e1tit hotovost, ne\u017e dividendy. Mnoho kritik\u016f si st\u011b\u017euje, \u017ee americk\u00e9 firmy v d\u016fsledku toho iracion\u00e1ln\u011b sout\u011b\u017e\u00ed o zp\u011btn\u00e9 odkupy. Ale rok 2020 zd\u016fraznil velkou v\u00fdhodu tohoto typu v\u00fdplaty: jeho flexibilitu. Kdy\u017e se ekonomika zastavila, mnoho velk\u00fdch firem okam\u017eit\u011b zastavilo sv\u00e9 v\u00fdkupy, aby \u0161et\u0159ilo hotovost. A co dividendy v Americe? Stejn\u011b jako v Evrop\u011b n\u011bkte\u0159\u00ed takzvan\u00ed dividendov\u00ed aristokrat\u00e9 (ti, kte\u0159\u00ed po cel\u00e1 l\u00e9ta zvy\u0161ovali z\u00e1kladn\u00ed dividendu) si \u017eili nad sv\u00fdmi pom\u011bry u\u017e p\u0159ed pandemi\u00ed a akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm d\u00e1vali v\u00edce pen\u011bz, ne\u017e kolik vyd\u011blali na zisku.

Hodnota dolarov\u00fdch dividend velk\u00fdch firem vzrostla z 342 miliard dolar\u016f v roce 2013 na 535 miliard v roce 2019, co\u017e je t\u0159ikr\u00e1t rychleji ne\u017e u dividend v Evrop\u011b.

Cynici je ozna\u010duj\u00ed za zp\u016fsob, jak uchl\u00e1cholit akcion\u00e1\u0159e. A v Americe je v posledn\u00edch n\u011bkolika desetilet\u00edch \u010d\u00edm d\u00e1l v\u00edce zasti\u0148uj\u00ed kontroverzn\u00ed zp\u011btn\u00e9 odkupy akci\u00ed.   Pro obchodn\u00ed historiky jsou v\u0161ak dividendy \u00fapln\u00e9 drama. Jejich duchovn\u00edm domovem je Evropa, kde se zrodily jako zp\u016fsob, jak rozd\u011blit ko\u0159ist holandsk\u00fdch a britsk\u00fdch lodn\u00edch monopol\u016f v 17. stolet\u00ed. V 19. stolet\u00ed b\u011bhem \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00edho boomu zrychlily u\u017e na obou stran\u00e1ch Atlantiku, \u010dasto podl\u00fdm zp\u016fsobem tak, aby plynouc\u00ed platby p\u0159il\u00e1kaly d\u016fv\u011b\u0159iv\u00e9 investory. Hromadn\u00e9 v\u00fdplaty v bou\u0159liv\u00fdch dvac\u00e1t\u00fdch letech minul\u00e9ho stolet\u00ed pomohly k p\u00e1du Wall Street v roce 1929. Ale po krizi byly pova\u017eov\u00e1ny za nejlep\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob, jak obnovit d\u016fv\u011bru investor\u016f.    To, co odhalily, kdy\u017e dorazily (anebo taky ne) akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm b\u011bhem pandemie covid-19, p\u0159id\u011blalo jejich p\u0159\u00edjemc\u016fm jen tr\u00e1pen\u00ed. Zejm\u00e9na v Evrop\u011b vlna sni\u017eov\u00e1n\u00ed dividend uk\u00e1zala, jak nemocn\u00e9 byly mnoh\u00e9 z nejpresti\u017en\u011bj\u0161\u00edch firem regionu. Dva evrop\u0161t\u00ed ropn\u00ed ob\u0159i, Royal Dutch  a , se sklonili p\u0159ed nevyhnuteln\u00fdm kolapsem cen ropy a na sv\u00e9 dividendy si rovnou vzali sekeru. Banky a \u017eivotn\u00ed poji\u0161\u0165ovny v cel\u00e9 Evrop\u011b, opora mnoha penzijn\u00edch fond\u016f s n\u00edzk\u00fdmi p\u0159\u00edjmy, pozastavily v\u00fdplaty pod tlakem finan\u010dn\u00edch regul\u00e1tor\u016f. Nezam\u011bniteln\u00fdm obrazem je k\u0159ehkost a \u00fapadek evropsk\u00e9ho korpor\u00e1tu.    V Americe je to jin\u00fd p\u0159\u00edb\u011bh. Firmy tam maj\u00ed sklon up\u0159ednost\u0148ovat zp\u011btn\u00fd odkup akci\u00ed. Nap\u0159\u00edklad v lo\u0148sk\u00e9m roce vyplatily nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed americk\u00e9 spole\u010dnosti v pr\u016fm\u011bru 41 % zisku v dividend\u00e1ch. Srovnateln\u00e9 evropsk\u00e9 firmy vyplatily 66 %. Akcie pro zp\u011btn\u00fd odkup ale tvo\u0159ily 59 %, resp. 23 %. Jedn\u00edm z d\u016fvod\u016f t\u00e9to preference je, \u017ee podle americk\u00fdch pravidel je odkup akci\u00ed da\u0148ov\u011b efektivn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob, jak akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm vr\u00e1tit hotovost, ne\u017e dividendy.

Ale rok 2020 zd\u016fraznil velkou v\u00fdhodu tohoto typu v\u00fdplaty: jeho flexibilitu. Kdy\u017e se ekonomika zastavila, mnoho velk\u00fdch firem okam\u017eit\u011b zastavilo sv\u00e9 v\u00fdkupy, aby \u0161et\u0159ilo hotovost.    A co dividendy v Americe?

Jejich duchovn\u00edm domovem je Evropa, kde se zrodily jako zp\u016fsob, jak rozd\u011blit ko\u0159ist holandsk\u00fdch a britsk\u00fdch lodn\u00edch monopol\u016f v 17. stolet\u00ed. V 19. stolet\u00ed b\u011bhem \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00edho boomu zrychlily u\u017e na obou stran\u00e1ch Atlantiku, \u010dasto podl\u00fdm zp\u016fsobem tak, aby plynouc\u00ed platby p\u0159il\u00e1kaly d\u016fv\u011b\u0159iv\u00e9 investory. Hromadn\u00e9 v\u00fdplaty v bou\u0159liv\u00fdch dvac\u00e1t\u00fdch letech minul\u00e9ho stolet\u00ed pomohly k p\u00e1du Wall Street v roce 1929. Ale po krizi byly pova\u017eov\u00e1ny za nejlep\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob, jak obnovit d\u016fv\u011bru investor\u016f. To, co odhalily, kdy\u017e dorazily (anebo taky ne) akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm b\u011bhem pandemie covid-19, p\u0159id\u011blalo jejich p\u0159\u00edjemc\u016fm jen tr\u00e1pen\u00ed. Zejm\u00e9na v Evrop\u011b vlna sni\u017eov\u00e1n\u00ed dividend uk\u00e1zala, jak nemocn\u00e9 byly mnoh\u00e9 z nejpresti\u017en\u011bj\u0161\u00edch firem regionu. Dva evrop\u0161t\u00ed ropn\u00ed ob\u0159i, Royal Dutch Shell a BP, se sklonili p\u0159ed nevyhnuteln\u00fdm kolapsem cen ropy a na sv\u00e9 dividendy si rovnou vzali sekeru. Banky a \u017eivotn\u00ed poji\u0161\u0165ovny v cel\u00e9 Evrop\u011b, opora mnoha penzijn\u00edch fond\u016f s n\u00edzk\u00fdmi p\u0159\u00edjmy, pozastavily v\u00fdplaty pod tlakem finan\u010dn\u00edch regul\u00e1tor\u016f. Nezam\u011bniteln\u00fdm obrazem je k\u0159ehkost a \u00fapadek evropsk\u00e9ho korpor\u00e1tu. V Americe je to jin\u00fd p\u0159\u00edb\u011bh. Firmy tam maj\u00ed sklon up\u0159ednost\u0148ovat zp\u011btn\u00fd odkup akci\u00ed. Nap\u0159\u00edklad v lo\u0148sk\u00e9m roce vyplatily nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed americk\u00e9 spole\u010dnosti v pr\u016fm\u011bru 41 % zisku v dividend\u00e1ch. Srovnateln\u00e9 evropsk\u00e9 firmy vyplatily 66 %. Akcie pro zp\u011btn\u00fd odkup ale tvo\u0159ily 59 %, resp. 23 %. Jedn\u00edm z d\u016fvod\u016f t\u00e9to preference je, \u017ee podle americk\u00fdch pravidel je odkup akci\u00ed da\u0148ov\u011b efektivn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed zp\u016fsob, jak akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm vr\u00e1tit hotovost, ne\u017e dividendy. Mnoho kritik\u016f si st\u011b\u017euje, \u017ee americk\u00e9 firmy v d\u016fsledku toho iracion\u00e1ln\u011b sout\u011b\u017e\u00ed o zp\u011btn\u00e9 odkupy. Ale rok 2020 zd\u016fraznil velkou v\u00fdhodu tohoto typu v\u00fdplaty: jeho flexibilitu. Kdy\u017e se ekonomika zastavila, mnoho velk\u00fdch firem okam\u017eit\u011b zastavilo sv\u00e9 v\u00fdkupy, aby \u0161et\u0159ilo hotovost. A co dividendy v Americe? Stejn\u011b jako v Evrop\u011b n\u011bkte\u0159\u00ed takzvan\u00ed dividendov\u00ed aristokrat\u00e9 (ti, kte\u0159\u00ed po cel\u00e1 l\u00e9ta zvy\u0161ovali z\u00e1kladn\u00ed dividendu) si \u017eili nad sv\u00fdmi pom\u011bry u\u017e p\u0159ed pandemi\u00ed a akcion\u00e1\u0159\u016fm d\u00e1vali v\u00edce pen\u011bz, ne\u017e kolik vyd\u011blali na zisku.

Hodnota dolarov\u00fdch dividend velk\u00fdch firem vzrostla z 342 miliard dolar\u016f v roce 2013 na 535 miliard v roce 2019, co\u017e je t\u0159ikr\u00e1t rychleji ne\u017e u dividend v Evrop\u011b.

Once this crisis ends, governments could push for state control of them as they have over energy firms.' [Emphasis added.] The Financial TimesEditorial Board's editorial, headlined 'Virus lays bare the frailty of the social contract[7],' pivoted off the pandemic to argue that 'to demand collective sacrifice you must offer a social contract that benefits everyone.' </p><p>[Emphasis added.]  The Financial Times Editorial Board speculated whether the 'current feelings of common purpose will shape society after the [coronavirus] crisis,' and suggested that 'Radical reforms \u2014 reversing the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades \u2014 will need to be put on the table.' [Emphasis added.]  The 'radical reforms' suggested by The Times reeked of socialist propaganda: 'Governments will have to accept a more active role in the economy. They must see public services as investments rather than liabilities, and look for ways to make labour markets less insecure. Redistribution will again be on the agenda; the privileges of the elderly and wealthy in question. Policies until recently considered eccentric, such as basic income and wealth taxes, will have to be in the mix,'[emphasis added].  The Economist, in another strain, predicted that big tech companies like Alphabet Inc. and Facebook will come out of the pandemic 'even stronger.' In turn, The Economist argued, 'They [tech companies] should use this good fortune to reset their sometimes testy relations with their users. Otherwise big government, the other beneficiary of the covid calamity, is likely to do it for them.' [Emphasis added.] The Economist summarized: 'In an abrupt twist, 'surveillance capitalism', as critics call big tech's business practices, is no longer seen as exploitative, but essential to tackle the virus,\"[emphasis added].  The Economist even attempted to normalize Big Tech's censorship practices: 'And no one is complaining about Facebook and Google zealously taking down misinformation about covid-19, and increasingly relying on [AI] to do so. Yet, before the pandemic, such activity would have triggered howls of outrage over censorship and bias.' The Economist must have missed MRC TechWatch's[8] recent work[9] on that subject. Is there anything more chilling than the government being in full control of the tech industry? The Economist concluded: 'In fact, more than ever it is clear that big tech firms act as vital utilities. Therein lies the trap, because almost everywhere other utilities, such as water or electricity, are heavily regulated and have their prices and profits capped.' The outlet used this dubious comparison to suggest that ' Once this crisis passes, startled citizens and newly emboldened governments could make a push for the state to have similar control over big tech.'

Once this crisis ends, governments could push for state control of them as they have over energy firms.' [Emphasis added.] The Financial TimesEditorial Board's editorial, headlined 'Virus lays bare the frailty of the social contract[7],' pivoted off the pandemic to argue that 'to demand collective sacrifice you must offer a social contract that benefits everyone.' </p><p>[Emphasis added.]  The Financial Times Editorial Board speculated whether the 'current feelings of common purpose will shape society after the [coronavirus] crisis,' and suggested that 'Radical reforms   reversing the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades   will need to be put on the table.' [Emphasis added.]  The 'radical reforms' suggested by The Times reeked of socialist propaganda: 'Governments will have to accept a more active role in the economy. They must see public services as investments rather than liabilities, and look for ways to make labour markets less insecure. Redistribution will again be on the agenda; the privileges of the elderly and wealthy in question. Policies until recently considered eccentric, such as basic income and wealth taxes, will have to be in the mix,'[emphasis added].  The Economist, in another strain, predicted that big tech companies like Alphabet Inc. and Facebook will come out of the pandemic 'even stronger.' In turn, The Economist argued, 'They [tech companies] should use this good fortune to reset their sometimes testy relations with their users. Otherwise big government, the other beneficiary of the covid calamity, is likely to do it for them.' [Emphasis added.] The Economist summarized: 'In an abrupt twist, 'surveillance capitalism', as critics call big tech's business practices, is no longer seen as exploitative, but essential to tackle the virus,\"[emphasis added].  The Economist even attempted to normalize Big Tech's censorship practices: 'And no one is complaining about Facebook and Google zealously taking down misinformation about covid-19, and increasingly relying on [AI] to do so. Yet, before the pandemic, such activity would have triggered howls of outrage over censorship and bias.' The Economist must have missed MRC TechWatch's[8] recent work[9] on that subject. Is there anything more chilling than the government being in full control of the tech industry? The Economist concluded: 'In fact, more than ever it is clear that big tech firms act as vital utilities. Therein lies the trap, because almost everywhere other utilities, such as water or electricity, are heavily regulated and have their prices and profits capped.' The outlet used this dubious comparison to suggest that ' Once this crisis passes, startled citizens and newly emboldened governments could make a push for the state to have similar control over big tech.'

Several key industry topics were bantered about by some of the best thought leaders in the industry on the final day of Transparency19[1]. In a panel discussion, \"The Bull, the Bear and the Other Guy,\" moderated by FreightWaves President George Abernathy, insight was provided about the direction of the freight markets and how disruptors and technology will lead the way. On the panel were: John Larkin, Managing Director-Investment Banking, Transportation and Logistics at Stifel; Donald Broughton, Managing Partner at Broughton Capital; and Thom Albrecht, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer at Celadon Group. Abernathy said, \"I'll try to guess who is the bull, the bear or the other guy.\" </p><p>Broughton said that the answer depends on the topic and the timeframe. He said that he is bearish on China and trade in the short-term. He said that after the huge tax reduction we had, we are on the verge of a serious tax increase in the form of tariffs. He's very bullish long-term on technology and believes that this is the information age. He said that the U.S. is the dominant force in \"lazy\" creation and will lead the future evolvement of hardware and software. Albrecht said that he thinks that the freight market will continue to deteriorate for the rest of the year. He said that the underlying economy is \"reasonably good\" with a moderation in growth being seen. He doesn't believe that we are on the cusp of a recession. He's concerned with the 491,000 truck orders last year and notes that every time there is a large truck order year, it's not very long before we have a hangover. \"I think that the infusion of supply is larger than people are acknowledging, demand has moderated a little bit. One thing I've learned in the year and a half that I've been at Celadon is truckers lie to one another.\" He said that capitalism works and that the driver pay increases definitely retained and brought incremental drivers to the market. Larkin said that he's been accused of being a cheerleader for the industry and a perma-bull. \"I'm high on America, I'm high on capitalism and I'm high on all of the people who come to this event to demonstrate their new technology which is really remarkable,\" he continued. He said that the \"tariff scare\" pulled freight forward into the last four or five months of 2018 and then poor weather compounded the problem. He still hopes for a May-June upswing, but is concerned operators will cave to rate pressure from shippers. Abernathy's next question was, \"Are you feeling the same way [rate pressure] in you interactions with the carriers and the shipper community and do you believe that the shippers are up to their old tricks?\" Broughton said that many drivers and trucks were added to the industry. He believes that regulation around electronic logging devices (ELDs) will add more capacity to the market. He doesn't think that we are headed to a recession, but noted that this capacity addition isn't all that dissimilar from the 2000 Y2K supply-led recession. He said that he looks at the economy as three economies; industrial, consumer and tech, all of which appear strong. \"The rate sloppiness is more a function of supply than it is demand,\" said Broughton. Albrecht said that trucking remains very cyclical with the booms only lasting five to six months followed by a series of corrections on the supply side. He equated that the addition of 3 percent of capacity to the truck market is the equivalent of adding 15 percent in other industries. \"These are horrible numbers folks,\" said Albrecht. He went on to provide two recent anecdotes. He said that after a couple of rounds of bidding on a piece of reefer business, Celadon decided to sharpen the pencil and go hard after 12 of the shipper's 38 lanes with quotes below their target price on all of the bids. They were only awarded one lane. Also, he spoke with a large freight broker that surveyed 850 brokers to gauge recent capacity additions. Those carriers grew capacity by 11 percent last year. Larkin said that most people in the audience have a long-term orientation and thinks it doesn't matter if the market improves by summer. He's looking forward to 2020, 2021 and 2022 and thinks that further conversion to ELDs (from automatic onboard recording devices, or AOBRDs) will restrict capacity. He sees tech and automation as a means to level out the trend of outsourced manufacturing overseas. He expects to see a big surge in demand as manufacturing returns. He believes Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN[2]) will take a bigger share of e-commerce and take labor out of the over-the-road workforce and deploy it in last-mile delivery. Next, Abernathy asked, \"Will the AOBRD conversion to ELDs be similar to the first ELD conversion? If we are already near full employment, how are you going to get new drivers?\" Albrecht believes that this ELD conversion will have little impact. He said that Celadon doesn't have the balance sheet to enter the final-mile business, but that it will support its customers that have e-commerce platforms. Abernathy then asked, \"Who does Amazon as a broker impact most?\" Broughton thinks Amazon has been a strong disruptor, but in business-to-consumer markets where the buyer is unsophisticated. He hasn't seen any successful Amazon disruptions in a business-to-business application where the buyer has scale and is very sophisticated. \"Will J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT[3]) be a major disruptor?,\" Abernathy asked. Larkin thinks that the asset-based carriers will see their operations more disrupted than asset-light third-party logistics providers. He said that Amazon has an in-house investment banking unit that can afford to pay higher multiples on acquisitions because they trade at a high multiple themselves. \"It's really difficult to insulate yourself from a big tech-driven e-commerce retailer that decides it wants to be in the transportation and logistics business,\" said Larkin. He believes that Amazon could quickly get to scale faster than most in the brokerage arena, but doesn't know if the company can develop better technology than what is being developed at the well-established high-tech brokers. Albrecht thinks that JBHT's unique culture could make them the rare disruptor that isn't a new entrant to the marketplace. He thinks that in three to five years, Amazon's prime delivery offering will be same-day with the top 100 metro markets' distribution centers within 15 to 50 miles of the delivery area. He thinks that Amazon and Uber Freight and the other \"not-for-profit\" brokers are going to have a real impact on the market. He believes that there will be multiple compressions on the M...f non-asset businesses and that peak valuations could be behind us. Broughton said that he doesn't believe that the line of demarcation is non-asset versus asset. He thinks that both can survive and thrive, but it depends on technology and transactions. He said that it's not just building or owning the technology, but you have to have the experience and ability to use it. Larkin noted that the risk to asset-intensive models is that they require a base level of volume in the network every day. He said that if that volume is removed and they can't get balance and utilization, they are at risk. He said that JBHT's trailer pool strategy will be interesting because most shippers are likely to trust the company more than a broker attempting to throw trailer pools into a market. Albrecht said that nothing will look the same in five years and that brokers will begin to own tractors if we have autonomous trucks. Albrecht concluded, \"I think the gross margin 10 years from now for brokers is going to be significantly lower, what we call a healthy gross margin, compared to what it is today.\" The post The economy, Amazon, JBHT, freight tech and digital brokers drive the conversation at Transparency19[4] appeared first on FreightWaves[5].

A day after lawmakers grilled the chief executives of the biggest tech companies about their size and power, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook reported surprisingly healthy quarterly financial results, defying one of the worst economic downturns on record.   Even though the companies felt some sting from the spending slowdown, they demonstrated, as critics have argued, that they are operating on a different playing field from the rest of the economy.   Amazon\u2019s sales were up 40% from a year ago, and its profit doubled. Facebook\u2019s profit jumped 98%. Even though the pandemic shuttered many of its stores, Apple increased sales of all its products in every part of the world and posted $11.25 billion in profit. Advertising revenue dropped for Alphabet, the laggard of the bunch, but it still did better than Wall Street had expected.   \u201cThe strong continue to get stronger,\u201d said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAs many companies are falling by the wayside, the tech stalwarts continue to gain muscle and power in this environment.\u201d   The tech companies\u2019 financial performance was a remarkable contrast to the overall health of the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department said Thursday that the country\u2019s gross domestic product fell 9.5% in the second quarter of the year as consumers cut back spending. It was the steepest drop on record.   Combined, the companies reported $28.6 billion in quarterly net profit, underscoring how regulatory scrutiny remains more background noise and a distraction for them than an imminent threat to their businesses.   On Wednesday, a congressional antitrust panel questioned the companies\u2019 leaders \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet \u2014 about their market power and business practices.   It was part of a broader inquiry by regulators and lawmakers into the dominance of the tech giants, with open investigations from the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.   The spectacle of the chief executives of the four companies, worth nearly $5 trillion by market capitalization combined, appearing before a House subcommittee was historic. But antitrust investigations often take years, especially if regulators seek more drastic measures like breaking up companies.   The pandemic has reinforced the advantages held by the big tech companies. As consumers stay home, demand for Amazon\u2019s shopping site surged, while companies are turning to its cloud computing products to keep their services up and running. Apple said the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices and use its services.   \u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. He noted, however, that Apple could have made several billion dollars more if not for the pandemic.   Facebook and Google continue to be important to marketers, and they are weathering the downturn in advertising better than rivals. Facebook shrugged off a spending slowdown, hailing record levels of engagement with its products.   Alphabet said revenue from Google search ads fell 10% \u2014 pushing the company\u2019s overall revenue lower for the first time in the company\u2019s history \u2014 but that still was better than rivals. Last week, Microsoft reported an 18% slide in search advertising revenue.   Since the beginning of March, the companies\u2019 stock prices have risen by an average of 35%, compared with a 10% rise in the S&amp;P 500.   Amazon   Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon had $88.9 billion in quarterly sales, up 40% from a year earlier. Profit doubled, to $5.2 billion, even though the company invested in expanding warehouses and other ways to increase capacity.   \u201cSimply put, COVID-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., wrote in a recent note to investors.   In April, Bezos told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend about $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses like temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing, and $300 million for testing its workforce for the virus.   But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales up 48%.   On a call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would give its warehouse workers virus-related bonuses or raises in the current quarter but added that pandemic-related expenses would fall to $2 billion in the quarter.   Sales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers include major corporations and small startups, grew 29%, to $10.8 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, although it was more profitable than they had expected.   FacebookFacebook\u2019s revenue for the second quarter rose 11% from a year earlier to $18.7 billion, while profits jumped 98% to $5.2 billion. The results were well above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.3 billion in revenue with a profit of $3.9 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.   Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about its role in subverting elections and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, neither users nor advertisers have shown an inclination to stop using Facebook.   More than 3 billion people now regularly come to Facebook or one of its family of apps, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world. And some 2.47 billion people use one or more of Facebook\u2019s apps every day.   The company said that its number of monthly active users rose 12% from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of shelter-in-place orders around the world.   In late June, a grassroots campaign, Stop Hate for Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to reduce their spending because of issues with hate speech on the site.   Facebook cautioned investors Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July and warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could eventually hurt Facebook\u2019s bottom line.   Apple   Despite the global economic slowdown, people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.   Apple said its sales rose 11% to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12% to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.   Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which include Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe.   Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, had a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.   Apple also announced a stock split Thursday that would quadruple its number of shares, allowing people to buy a share in the company for a quarter of the current stock price, which closed at $384.76 on Thursday.   Alphabet   Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. The company posted revenue of $38.3 billion and a profit of $6.96 billion \u2014 significantly higher than what Wall Street analysts had predicted.   Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said advertising revenue \u201cgradually improved\u201d as the quarter went on. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside Google\u2019s search results, but the company\u2019s efforts to diversify its business paid off as revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud computing business grew.   When asked in a call with financial analysts about the congressional hearing, Pichai said the company would have to learn to live with the investigations.   \u201cThe scrutiny is going to be here for a while, and we\u2019re committed to working through it,\u201d he said.  c.2020 The New York Times Company</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Facebook\u2019s profit jumped 98 percent.

As consumers stay home, demand for Amazon\u2019s shopping site surged, while companies are turning to its cloud computing products to keep their services up and running. Apple said the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices and use its services.</p><p>\u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. He noted, however, that Apple could have made several billion dollars more if not for the pandemic.</p><p>Facebook and Google continue to be important to marketers and they are weathering the downturn in advertising better than rivals.

The results were well above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.3 billion in revenue with a profit of $3.9 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.</p><p>Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-us-economys-contraction-in-the-second-quarter-was-the-worst-on-record\">its role in subverting elections</url> and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, neither users nor advertisers have shown an inclination to stop using Facebook.</p><p>More than three billion people now regularly come to Facebook or one of its family of apps, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world. And some 2.47 billion people use one or more of Facebook\u2019s apps every day.</p><p>The company said its number of monthly active users rose 12 percent from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of shelter-in-place orders around the world.</p><p>In late June, a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate for Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-us-economys-contraction-in-the-second-quarter-was-the-worst-on-record\">reduce their spending</url> because of issues with hate speech on the site.</p><p>Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July and warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could eventually hurt Facebook\u2019s bottom line.</p><p>Apple</p><p>Despite the global <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-us-economys-contraction-in-the-second-quarter-was-the-worst-on-record\">economic slowdown</url>, people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.</p><p>Apple said its sales rose 11 percent to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12 percent to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.</p><p>Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which include Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-us-economys-contraction-in-the-second-quarter-was-the-worst-on-record\">the United States</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-us-economys-contraction-in-the-second-quarter-was-the-worst-on-record\">Europe</url>.</p><p>Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, had a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.</p><p>Apple also announced a stock split on Thursday that would quadruple its number of shares, allowing people to buy a share in the company for a quarter of the current stock price, which closed at $384.76 on Thursday.</p><p>Alphabet</p><p>Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. The company posted revenue of $38.3 billion and a profit of $6.96 billion \u2014 significantly higher than what Wall Street analysts had predicted.</p><p>Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said advertising revenue \u201cgradually improved\u201d as the quarter went on. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside Google\u2019s search results, but the company\u2019s efforts to diversify its business paid off as revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud computing business grew.</p><p>When asked in a call with financial analysts about the congressional hearing, Mr. Pichai said the company would have to learn to live with the investigations.</p><p>\u201cThe scrutiny is going to be here for a while and we\u2019re committed to working through it,\u201d he said.</p><p>PHOTO: Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Amazon reported a combined $28 billion in profits on Thursday.
