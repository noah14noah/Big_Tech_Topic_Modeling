Decision-makers should think of these trends as waves, which, especially if they occur simultaneously, could feel like a tsunami for those who fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first and most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from a relatively distant concern, on which there is ample time to take remedial action, to an imminent and increasingly urgent threat.</p><p>The mobilisation of various concerned segments of society, owing partly to unusual climatic disruptions in recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies to act now. British Petroleum's recent announcement that it intends to achieve \"net-zero\" carbon emissions by 2050-a notable promise by an energy company that operates in several highly challenging settings-is the latest example of business responding to such calls. It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities but also to tax and regulate those that cause pollution.</p><p>Second, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations involving artificial intelligence and big data.</p><p>Society is increasingly recognising that recent technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data but also for using this information to monitor and alter behaviours. Broadly speaking, data are controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), big tech companies (as in the US), or more by users (as in Europe). But, none of these three general operating paradigms seems to provide sufficient comfort and assurance to most people.</p><p>The third secular force involves disruptions to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation.</p><p>The initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by US president Donald Trump's administration-from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism), and from rule-based to more ad hoc arrangements-aimed at creating a still-free, but fairer trading system. But, de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 virus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond.</p><p>These challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management, and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth.</p><p>The final trend is demographic and concerns more than the aging of societies in Europe and Asia, and this trend's economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials' starkly different expectations-regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action, and the delivery of goods and services-will persist and deepen.</p><p>For starters, businesses need to be smarter about \"anywhere, any place, any time\" delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfillment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become a lot easier, yet, often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterward. And, all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions from physical to virtual spaces.</p><p>Each of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies, and governments alike. And, while being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers therefore, must make timely revisions (including pre-emptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets.</p><p>Getting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality, and agility also is important. And, this is even before one considers unanticipated periodic shocks such as the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>The challenges to sound decision-making and leadership in both business and government are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the required adaptation. Decision-makers also must consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.</p><p>As a quick illustration, consider another aspect of demographic change: migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows that they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse.</p><p>The combination of de-globalisation, and the misuse of AI and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments, and encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.</p><p>The world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can help anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional, and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs, and risks in their favour.</p><p>(Chief economic Adviser, Allianz.

It was September 2017, more than a year  after Facebook engineers discovered suspicious Russia-linked  activity on its site, an early warning of the Kremlin campaign to  disrupt the 2016 U.S. election. Congressional and federal  investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the  company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But it wasn't the looming disaster at Facebook that angered  Sandberg. It was the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos,  who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook  had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Stamos' briefing had  prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Sandberg,  Face-book's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She  appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"You threw us under the bus!\" she yelled at Stamos, according  to people who were present.</p><p> The clash that day would set off a reckoning -- for Zuckerberg,  for Sand-berg and for the business they had built together. In just  over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people,  a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the  advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the  way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of  personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that  propelled the company into the Fortune 500.</p><p> But as evidence accumulated that Facebook's power could also be  exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and  inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Zuckerberg and  Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs  and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical  moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal  projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to  subordinates, according to current and former executives.</p><p> When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had  compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to  the personal information of tens of millions of people to a  political data firm linked to President Donald Trump, Facebook  sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.</p><p> And when that failed -- as the company's stock price plummeted  and it faced a consumer backlash -- Facebook went on the attack.</p><p> While Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the  last year, Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to  combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival  companies and ward off damaging regulation. Face-book employed a  Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist  protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George  Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a  Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as  anti-Semitic.</p><p> In Washington, allies of Face-book, including Sen. Chuck  Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf.  And Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to  dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p> This account of how Zuckerberg and Sandberg navigated  Facebook's cascading crises,much of which has not been previously  reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They  include current and former Facebook executives and other employees,  lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional  staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because  they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to  speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Zuckerberg and Sandberg available for  comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had  been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress  fixing the platform.</p><p> \"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire  management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\"  the statement said. \"While these are hard problems we are working  hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we  protect our community from bad actors.\"</p><p> Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its  pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement  officials in the United States and Europe are investigating  Facebook's conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm  that worked with Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to  fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and  lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law,  setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Face-book's  data-hungry business model.</p><p> \"We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind  corners,\" Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global  communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an  interview.</p><p> Zuckerberg, 34, and Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm,  while Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after  disputes over Facebook's priorities. Zuckerberg, who controls the  social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who  approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the  last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p> His answer each time: a resounding \"No.\"</p><p> 'DON'T POKE THE BEAR'</p><p> Three years ago, Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while  attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary  success. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and  Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of  her empowerment manifesto, \"Lean In,\" in 2013.</p><p> Like other technology executives, Zuckerberg and Sandberg cast  their company as a force for social good. Facebook's lofty aims  were emblazoned even on securities filings: \"Our mission is to make  the world more open and connected.\"</p><p> But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and  other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists  in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had  become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing,  the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as  a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users  posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many  Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p> Then Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants  and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a  statement on Facebook calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\"  on Muslims entering the United States. Trump's call to arms --  widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans -- was  shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the  site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p> Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to  immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him  or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Sandberg and other  executives if Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.</p><p> The question was unusual. Zuckerberg typically focused on  broader technology issues; politics was Sandberg's domain. In 2010,  Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton  alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook's chief Washington representative.  A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House,  Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican:  Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Sandberg and later  served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p> Some at Facebook viewed Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an  opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech  coursing through its platform. But Sandberg, who was edging back to  work after the death of her husband several months earlier,  delegated the matter to Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former  prosecutor whom Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of  global policy management. Sandberg also turned to the Washington  office -- particularly to Kaplan, said people who participated in  or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p> In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley  headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their  task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if  the post, or Trump's account, violated Face-book's rules.</p><p> Kaplan argued that Trump was an important public figure and  that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be  seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of  the discussions. He also said it could also stoke a conservative  backlash.</p><p> \"Don't poke the bear,\" Kaplan warned.</p><p> Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Sandberg attended  some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.</p><p> Schrage concluded that Trump's language had not violated  Face-book's rules and that the candidate's views had public value.  \"We were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and  technical evidence before us,\" he said in an interview.</p><p> In the end, Trump's statement and account remained on the site.  When Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control  of the White House as well as Congress, Kaplan was empowered to  plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Trump's new  attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked  to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet  companies.</p><p> But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.</p><p> MINIMIZING RUSSIA'S ROLE</p><p> In the final months of Trump's presidential campaign, Russian  agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his  Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of  emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its  own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on  Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to  his boss, Stamos.</p><p> Stamos' team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be  probing Face-book accounts for people connected to the presidential  campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Trump battled  Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found  Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging  journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p> Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel,  about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations.  At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any  resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p> Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize  the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after  Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook  had helped elect Trump, Stamos -- alarmed that the company's chief  executive seemed unaware of his team's findings -- met with  Zuckerberg, Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p> Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without  approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other  executives asked Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p> Still, Sandberg and Zuckerberg decided to expand on Stamos'  work, creating a group called Project P, for \"propaganda,\" to study  false news on the site, according to people involved in the  discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Stamos' original  team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on  Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p> But Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington  was already reeling from an official finding by U.S. intelligence  agencies that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had personally  ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Trump.</p><p> If Facebook implicated Russia further, Kaplan said, Republicans  would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook  pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Face-book users might  also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own  mother-in-law, Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by  Russian trolls.</p><p> Sandberg sided with Kaplan, recalled four people involved.  Zuckerberg -- who spent much of 2017 on a national \"listening  tour,\" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali  refugees in Minnesota -- did not participate in the conversations  about the public paper. When it was published that April, the word  \"Russia\" never appeared.</p><p> Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington,  where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by  Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Throughout the spring  and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down  Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly  claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on  Facebook.</p><p> But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages  and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided  Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking  more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook  executives concluded that the situation had become what one called  a \"five-alarm fire,\" said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p> Zuckerberg and Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings,  and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of  the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p> After Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Sandberg  and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Zuckerberg  also asked Stamos and Stretch to brief the board's audit committee,  chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House  veteran.</p><p> Stretch and Stamos went into more detail with the audit  committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find  even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p> The disclosures set off Bowles, who after years in Washington  could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men,  occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become  a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had  taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors  were only now being told.</p><p> When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the  company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Bowles  pelted questions at Facebook's founder and second-in-command.  Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Zuckerberg, stone-faced,  whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or  were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p> Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It  said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by  Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only  that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 -- a relatively tiny  sum -- on approximately 3,000 ads.</p><p> Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission,  The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on  Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts  to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent  Washington figures.</p><p> A POLITICAL PLAYBOOK</p><p> The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally  fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and  other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans,  already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative  views, accused Facebook of fueling what they claimed were meritless  conspiracy charges against Trump and Russia. Democrats, long allied  with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights,  now blamed Trump's win partly on Facebook's tolerance for fraud and  disinformation.</p><p> After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand  over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, Facebook  was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging  that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p> The same month, Warner and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.,  introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms  to disclose who bought political ads on their sites -- a  significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p> \"It's time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by  Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\"  Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled,  Facebook hired Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby  on it. Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's  Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for  words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p> Sandberg also reached out to Klobuchar. She had been friendly  with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In,  Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Sandberg had contributed a blurb  to Klobuchar's 2015 memoir, and the senator's chief of staff had  previously worked at Sand-berg's charitable foundation.</p><p> But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation  was introduced, Sandberg complained about Klobuchar's attacks on  the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Klobuchar  did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her  criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After  blasting Face-book repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page,  Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November  and February.</p><p> A spokesman for Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook's  lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company  accountable. \"Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the  Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and  refused to change the bill,\" he said.</p><p> In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a  Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had  originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company.  Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers  specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate  public relations -- an approach long employed in Washington by big  telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less  common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that  year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who  preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For  tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \"have  positive content pushed out about your company and negative content  that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the  social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling  Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for  sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it  would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was  championed by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who had pummeled Facebook  over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Sen.  Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a senior commerce committee member who  was a frequent critic of Facebook.</p><p>Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move  would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two  congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.</p><p> When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Sandberg  offered public support online, urging Congress to \"make sure we  pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\"</p><p> OPPOSITION RESEARCH</p><p> In March, The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian  prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user  data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile  American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented  Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook  data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge  executives and others to delete it.</p><p> Zuckerberg and Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine  a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a  statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had  suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives  figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow,  according to people in the discussions.</p><p> They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting  lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and  Brussels. For days, Zuckerberg and Sandberg remained out of sight,  mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved  into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off  Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech  firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p> \"We're not going to traffic in your personal life,\" Tim Cook,  Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \"Privacy to us  is a human right. It's a civil liberty.\" (Cook's criticisms  infuriated Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use  only Android phones -- arguing that the operating system had far  more users than Apple's.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal  communications campaign, called \"We Get It,\" meant to assure  employees that the company was committed to getting back on track  in 2018.</p><p> Then Facebook went on the offensive. Kaplan prevailed on  Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications  Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead  the company's U.S. lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its  work with Definers.</p><p> On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of  articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices.  One story called Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over  privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.  Another played down the impact of the Russians' use of Facebook.</p><p> The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate  of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations  firm in Arlington, Virginia. Many NTK Network stories are written  by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's  political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients'  enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of  its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular  conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p> Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly  compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology  company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple  because Cook's criticism upset Facebook.</p><p> If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \"muddy the  waters,\" Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, California, bar  last month.</p><p> In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Zuckerberg agreed to  testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising  campaign, titled \"Here Together,\" to apologize to its users. Days  before Zuckerberg's appearance in Congress in April, Facebook  announced that it was endorsing Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and  would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also  informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by  Cambridge Analytica.</p><p> But Zuckerberg's goodwill tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive  coaching and preparation, the company's communications team  believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April  hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic -- a suspicion  confirmed by Face-book's pollsters.</p><p> Zuckerberg's political instincts were no more well-tuned.  During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Rep. Greg Walden,  R-Ore., who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to  express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p> Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark.  Facebook's leader, Walden realized, did not understand the breadth  of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p> PERSONAL APPEALS</p><p> IN WASHINGTON</p><p> Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems.  But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p> Some colleagues believed that Sandberg -- whose ambitions to  return to public life were much discussed at the company -- was  protecting her own brand at Facebook's expense. At one company  gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told  Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively,  its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p> So Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's  Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Zuckerberg  sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties,  but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that  Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its  workforce than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an  entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Sandberg  made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and  others she met.</p><p> Her top Republican target was Burr, whose Senate committee's  Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone,  according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive,  and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a  serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the  dangers posed by its product, Sandberg argued that the company was  grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary  growth.</p><p> She made the same case in June at a conference of the National  Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Oregon. At the time,  several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into  the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.</p><p> The company organized several private receptions, including  what was billed as a conversation with Sandberg about \"corporate  citizenship in the digital age\" and a briefing on Cambridge  Analytica.</p><p> While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new  federal regulations, Sandberg privately contended that the social  network was already adopting the best reforms and policies  available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only  disadvantage smaller competitors.</p><p> Some of the officials were skeptical. But Sandberg's presence  -- companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such  gatherings -- persuaded others that Facebook was serious about  addressing its problems, according to two who attended the  conference.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism  to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook's  previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers  -- partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers --  executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p> In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a  dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among  the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social  media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google  struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p> DEFLECTING CRITICISM</p><p> By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming  from the political left, where activists and policy experts had  begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p> In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from  Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where  a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the  executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Sandberg  and Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus  stretching around the globe.</p><p> Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led  the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons  of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official  quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil  rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech  companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017  on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p> That afternoon, the ADL issued a warning from its Twitter  account.</p><p> \"Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic  anti-Semitic trope,\" the organization wrote. \"Protest Facebook --  or anyone -- all you want, but pick a different image.\" The  criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The  Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from  Facebook to what the publication calls \"extreme anti-Israel  groups.\"</p><p> An ADL spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group  routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists,  synagogues and others. \"Our experts evaluate each one based on our  years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\" Alcantara said.  (The group has at times sharply criticized Facebook, including when  Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust  deniers.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such  as Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the  target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research  document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a  month after the House hearing, cast Soros as the unacknowledged  force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p> He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic  Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing  them as a monopolist \"menace\" with \"neither the will nor the  inclination to protect society against the consequences of their  actions.\"</p><p> Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections  between Soros' family or philanthropies and groups that were  members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an  online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group  founded by Soros' son. (An official at Soros' Open Society  Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups,  but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support  campaigns against Face-book.)</p><p> Definers also circulated research about other critics of  Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media  stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.</p><p> In at least one instance, the company also relied on Schumer,  the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long  worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as  commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016  election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than  any other member of Congress, according to the Center for  Responsive Politics.</p><p> Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His  daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a  marketing manager in Facebook's New York office, according to her  LinkedIn profile.</p><p> In July, as Facebook's troubles threatened to cost the company  billions of dollars in market value, Schumer confronted Warner, by  then Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p> Back off, he told Warner, according to a Facebook employee  briefed on Schumer's intervention. Warner should be looking for  ways to work with Facebook, Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook  lobbyists were kept abreast of Schumer's efforts to protect the  company, according to the employee.</p><p> A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Schumer had not  wanted Warner to lose sight of the need for Face-book to tackle  problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference,  as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p> THE WAR ROOM</p><p> One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact  paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook's  Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted  outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself  on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference  rooms.</p><p> But Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence  Committee -- a pivotal encounter for her embattled company -- and  her aides were taking no chances.</p><p> Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing.  They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually  every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former  White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate  executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence  Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning  Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship.  The argument was persuasive with Burr, who was determined to avoid  a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a  stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of  election interference.</p><p> In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a  placard labeled \"Google.\" Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to  include a Google emissary of similar rank to Sandberg. The company  won a partial victory when Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google  co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's  chief executive.</p><p> Dorsey showed up. Page did not.</p><p> As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its  absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook's  rival.</p><p> Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before  her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet  questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p> In large letters were her stage directions: \"Slow, Pause,  Determined.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20181122Ar04000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSY-GM91-JBCN-41JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This is how Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg responded.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sheryl Sandberg was seething.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inside Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, top executives gathered in the glass-walled conference room of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. It was September 2017, more than a year after Facebook engineers discovered suspicious Russia-linked activity on its site, an early warning of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html\">Kremlin campaign to disrupt the 2016 American election</url>. Congressional and federal investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it wasn\u2019t the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Sheryl Sandberg is said to have asked Facebook employees to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\">examine George Soros\u2019s finances</url> after he criticized the social media giant.]</p><p>\u201cYou threw us under the bus!\u201d she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.</p><p>The clash that day would set off a reckoning \u2014 for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.</p><p>[Here\u2019s how Facebook failed to police how its partners <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/technology/facebook-data-privacy-users.html?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\">handled user data</url>.]</p><p>But as evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.</p><p>When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.</p><p>And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack.</p><p>While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook\u2019s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>\u201cThis has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\u201d</p><p>Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook\u2019s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook\u2019s data-hungry business model.</p><p>[Despite a turbulent two years, here\u2019s why almost no one in tech thinks Mark Zuckerberg should <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\">step down from the company he built</url>.]</p><p>\u201cWe failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u201d Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, and Ms. Sandberg, 49, remain at the company\u2019s helm, while Mr. Stamos and other high-profile <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/whatsapp-facebook-jan-koum.html\">executives have left</url> after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/technology/instagram-cofounders-resign-zuckerberg.html\">disputes</url> over Facebook\u2019s priorities. Mr. Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>His answer each time: a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t Poke the Bear\u2019</p><p>Three years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company\u2019s extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \u201cLean In,\u201d in 2013.</p><p>Like other technology executives, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook\u2019s lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm\">Our mission is to make the world more open and connected</url>.\u201d</p><p>But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>Then Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10156386906600725\">posted a statement</url> on Facebook calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump\u2019s call to arms \u2014 widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans \u2014 was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site\u2019s power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, who had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fwd.us/\">helped found a nonprofit</url> dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated Facebook\u2019s terms of service.</p><p>The question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg\u2019s domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook\u2019s chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p>Some at Facebook viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform. But Ms. Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Mr. Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Ms. Sandberg had recruited as the company\u2019s head of global policy management. Ms. Sandberg also turned to the Washington office \u2014 particularly to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/technology/facebook-moves-to-repair-its-fractured-relationship-with-the-right.html\">Mr. Kaplan</url>, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company\u2019s terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump\u2019s account, violated Facebook\u2019s rules.</p><p>Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t poke the bear,\u201d Mr. Kaplan warned.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.</p><p>Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s language had not violated Facebook\u2019s rules and that the candidate\u2019s views had public value. \u201cWe were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump\u2019s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.</p><p>But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.</p><p>Minimizing Russia\u2019s Role</p><p>In the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.</p><p>Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos \u2014 alarmed that the company\u2019s chief executive seemed unaware of his team\u2019s findings \u2014 met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos\u2019s work, creating a group called Project P, for \u201cpropaganda,\u201d to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos\u2019s original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>But Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.</p><p>If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians\u2019 fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg sided with Mr. Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 who spent much of 2017 on a national \u201clistening tour,\u201d feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota \u2014 did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When <url normalizedValue=\"https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/facebook-and-information-operations-v1.pdf\">it was published</url> that April, the word \u201cRussia\u201d never appeared.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg\u2019s subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators\u2019 concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.</p><p>But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \u201cfive-alarm fire,\u201d said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company\u2019s quarterly board meeting.</p><p>After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board\u2019s audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.</p><p>When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company\u2019s headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook\u2019s founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>Later that day, the company\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/\">abbreviated blog post</url> went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 \u2014 a relatively tiny sum \u2014 on approximately 3,000 ads.</p><p>Just one day after the company\u2019s carefully sculpted admission, The Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html\">published an investigation</url> of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>A Political Playbook</p><p>The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans, already concerned that the platform was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/technology/conservatives-accuse-facebook-of-political-bias.html\">censoring conservative views</url>, accused Facebook of fueling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Mr. Trump and Russia. Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Mr. Trump\u2019s win partly on Facebook\u2019s tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html\">126 million people</url> had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites \u2014 a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner\u2019s former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan\u2019s team took a larger role in managing the company\u2019s Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s 2015 memoir, and the senator\u2019s chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg\u2019s charitable foundation.</p><p>But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook\u2019s lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \u201cFacebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\u201d he said.</p><p>In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations \u2014 an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/6/7/15746928/republicans-political-opposition-tech-silicon-valley-trump\">one interview</url>, a goal should be to \u201chave positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that\u2019s being pushed out about your competitor.\u201d</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.</p><p>Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.</p><p>When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to \u201cmake sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\u201d</p><p>Opposition Research</p><p>In March, The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian prepared to publish <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">a joint investigation</url> into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\u201d (Mr. Cook\u2019s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company\u2019s American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook.</p><p>The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company\u2019s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients\u2019 enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p>Mr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers\u2019 work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook\u2019s criticism upset Facebook.</p><p>If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \u201cmuddy the waters,\u201d Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.</p><p>On Thursday, after this article was published, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/facebook-definers-soros.html\">said that it had ended its relationship with Definers</url>, without citing a reason.</p><p>In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \u201cHere Together,\u201d to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company\u2019s communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic \u2014 a suspicion confirmed by Facebook\u2019s pollsters.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p>Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook\u2019s leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>Personal Appeals in Washington</p><p>Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company\u2019s problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg \u2014 whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company \u2014 was protecting her own brand at Facebook\u2019s expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company\u2019s Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee\u2019s Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.</p><p>She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.</p><p>The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about \u201ccorporate citizenship in the digital age\u201d and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.</p><p>Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s presence \u2014 companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings \u2014 persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook\u2019s previously undisclosed deals to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html\">share user data with device makers</url> \u2014 partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers \u2014 executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>Deflecting Criticism</p><p>By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p>That afternoon, the A.D.L. <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/adl_national/status/1019290099778023424?lang=bg\">issued a warning</url> from its Twitter account.</p><p>\u201cDepicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cProtest Facebook \u2014 or anyone \u2014 all you want, but pick a different image.\u201d The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \u201cextreme anti-Israel groups.\u201d</p><p>An A.D.L. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \u201cOur experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\u201d Ms. Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticized Facebook, including when Mr. Zuckerberg suggested that his company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial.html\">should not censor Holocaust deniers</url>.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p>He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \u201cmenace\u201d with \u201cneither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\u201d</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son. (An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)</p><p>Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/us/politics/diamond-silk-facebook.html\">who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook</url>.</p><p>In at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr. Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley\u2019s interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/toprecips.php?id=D000033563&amp;type=P&amp;sort=A&amp;cycle=2016\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</url>.</p><p>Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook\u2019s New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>In July, as Facebook\u2019s troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer\u2019s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>The War Room</p><p>One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook\u2019s Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 a pivotal encounter for her embattled company \u2014 and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled \u201cGoogle.\u201d Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.</p><p>As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook\u2019s rival.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>In large letters were her stage directions: \u201cSlow, Pause, Determined.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Under Mark Zuckerberg, the founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook has gone on the attack amid mounting scandals.

This is how Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg responded.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sheryl Sandberg was seething.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inside Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, top executives gathered in the glass-walled conference room of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. It was September 2017, more than a year after Facebook engineers discovered suspicious Russia-linked activity on its site, an early warning of the Kremlin campaign to disrupt the 2016 American election. Congressional and federal investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it wasn't the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos's briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You threw us under the bus!\" she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.</p><p>The clash that day would set off a reckoning - for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Here's how Facebook failed to police how its partners handled user data.]</emphasis></p><p>But as evidence accumulated that Facebook's power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.</p><p>When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.</p><p>And when that failed - as the company's stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash - Facebook went on the attack.</p><p>While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook's cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>\"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\" the statement said. \"While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\"</p><p>Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook's conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook's data-hungry business model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Despite a turbulent two years, here's why almost no one in tech thinks Mark Zuckerberg should step down from the company he built.]</emphasis></p><p>\"We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\" Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, and Ms. Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm, while Mr. Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook's priorities. Mr. Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>His answer each time: a resounding \"No.\"</p><p>'Don't Poke the Bear'</p><p>Three years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \"Lean In,\" in 2013.</p><p>Like other technology executives, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected.\"</p><p>But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>Then Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump's call to arms - widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans - was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.</p><p>The question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg's domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook's chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p>Some at Facebook viewed Mr. Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform. But Ms. Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Mr. Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Ms. Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of global policy management. Ms. Sandberg also turned to the Washington office - particularly to Mr. Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump's account, violated Facebook's rules.</p><p>Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>\"Don't poke the bear,\" Mr. Kaplan warned.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.</p><p>Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump's language had not violated Facebook's rules and that the candidate's views had public value. \"We were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>In the end, Mr. Trump's statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump's new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.</p><p>But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.</p><p>Minimizing Russia's Role</p><p>In the final months of Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.</p><p>Mr. Stamos's team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos - alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings - met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos's work, creating a group called Project P, for \"propaganda,\" to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos's original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>But Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.</p><p>If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg sided with Mr. Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr. Zuckerberg - who spent much of 2017 on a national \"listening tour,\" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota - did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was  published that April, the word \"Russia\" never appeared.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.</p><p>But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \"five-alarm fire,\" said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p>After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board's audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.</p><p>When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook's founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 - a relatively tiny sum - on approximately 3,000 ads.</p><p>Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission, The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>A Political Playbook</p><p>The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans, already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative views, accused Facebook of fueling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Mr. Trump and Russia. Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Mr. Trump's win partly on Facebook's tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites - a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>\"It's time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\" Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar's 2015 memoir, and the senator's chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg's charitable foundation.</p><p>But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar's attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook's lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \"Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\" he said.</p><p>In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations - an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.</p><p>Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.</p><p>When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to \"make sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\"</p><p>Opposition Research</p><p>In March, The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>\"We're not going to traffic in your personal life,\" Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \"Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.\" (Mr. Cook's criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones - arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple's.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \"We Get It,\" meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company's American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians' use of Facebook.</p><p>The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients' enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p>Mr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook's criticism upset Facebook.</p><p>If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \"muddy the waters,\" Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.</p><p>On Thursday, after this article was published, Facebook said that it had ended its relationship with Definers, without citing a reason.</p><p>In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \"Here Together,\" to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg's appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>But Mr. Zuckerberg's good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company's communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic - a suspicion confirmed by Facebook's pollsters.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg's political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p>Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook's leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>Personal Appeals in Washington</p><p>Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg - whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company - was protecting her own brand at Facebook's expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee's Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.</p><p>She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.</p><p>The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about \"corporate citizenship in the digital age\" and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.</p><p>Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg's presence - companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings - persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook's previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers - partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers - executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>Deflecting Criticism</p><p>By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p>That afternoon, the A.D.L. issued a warning from its Twitter account.</p><p>\"Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\" the organization wrote. \"Protest Facebook - or anyone - all you want, but pick a different image.\" The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \"extreme anti-Israel groups.\"</p><p>An A.D.L. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \"Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\" Ms. Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticized Facebook, including when Mr. Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p>He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \"menace\" with \"neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\"</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros's family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros's son. (An official at Mr. Soros's Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)</p><p>Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.</p><p>In at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr. Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>In July, as Facebook's troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer's intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer's efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>The War Room</p><p>One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook's Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee - a pivotal encounter for her embattled company - and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled \"Google.\" Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.</p><p>As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook's rival.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>In large letters were her stage directions: \"Slow, Pause, Determined.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006151342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRP-GB31-JC85-N007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 17, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook went on the attack.</p><p>While Zuckerberg conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros.</p><p>It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>This account of how Zuckerberg and Sandberg navigated Facebook's cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people.</p><p>They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members.</p><p>Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorised to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Zuckerberg and Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>\"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\" the statement said. \"While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\"</p><p>Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed.</p><p>Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook's conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability.</p><p>Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a years-long struggle over the future of Facebook's data-hungry business model.</p><p>\"We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\" Elliot Schrage, former vice-president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.</p><p>Zuckerberg, 34, and Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm, while Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook's priorities.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 per cent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>His answer each time: a resounding \"No.\"</p><p>Three years ago, Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary success.</p><p>Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, Lean In, in 2013.</p><p>Like other technology executives, Zuckerberg and Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good.</p><p>Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected.\"</p><p>But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform.</p><p>When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them.</p><p>Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher.</p><p>Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>Then Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on Muslims entering the United States.</p><p>Trump's call to arms ??? widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans ??? was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation.</p><p>He asked Sandberg and other executives if Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.</p><p>The question was unusual. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Sandberg's domain.</p><p>In 2010, Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook's chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p>Some at Facebook viewed Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform.</p><p>But Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of global policy.</p><p>Sandberg also turned to the Washington office ??? particularly to Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if the post, or Trump's account, violated Facebook's rules.</p><p>Kaplan argued that Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He also said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>\"Don't poke the bear,\" Kaplan warned.</p><p>In the final months of Trump's presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Stamos.</p><p>Stamos' team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees.</p><p>Months later, as Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations.</p><p>At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinise the extent of Russian activity on Facebook.</p><p>In December 2016, after Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Trump, Stamos ??? alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings ??? met with Zuckerberg, Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p>Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>Still, Sandberg and Zuckerberg decided to expand on Stamos' work, creating a group called Project P, for \"propaganda,\" to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions.</p><p>By January 2017, the group knew that Stamos' original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>But Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by US intelligence agencies that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Trump.</p><p>If Facebook implicated Russia further, Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>Sandberg sided with Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Zuckerberg ??? who spent much of 2017 on a national \"listening tour,\" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota ??? did not participate in the conversations about the public paper.</p><p>When it was published that April, the word \"Russia\" never appeared.</p><p>Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner.</p><p>Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.</p><p>But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance.</p><p>By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \"five-alarm fire,\" said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on September 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p>After Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific.</p><p>She and Zuckerberg also asked Stamos and Stretch to brief the board's audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>Stretch and Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>The disclosures set off Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react.</p><p>He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference.</p><p>He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.</p><p>When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Bowles pelted questions at Facebook's founder and second-in-command.</p><p>Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologised. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 ??? a relatively tiny sum ??? on approximately 3000 ads.</p><p>Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission, The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference.</p><p>Republicans, already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative views, accused Facebook of fuelling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Trump and Russia.</p><p>Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Trump's win partly on Facebook's tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress.</p><p>Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>The same month, Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites ??? a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>\"It's time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians and paid for in Rubles during the last election,\" Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>Sandberg also reached out to Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Klobuchar's 2015 memoir, and the senator's chief of staff had previously worked at Sandberg's charitable foundation.</p><p>But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Sandberg complained about Klobuchar's attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation.</p><p>But she dialled down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>A spokesman for Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook's lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \"Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\" he said.</p><p>In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company.</p><p>Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialised in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations ??? an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favour of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>In March, The Times and The Observer/Guardian prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Zuckerberg and Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>\"We're not going to traffic in your personal life,\" Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \"Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.\" (Cook's criticisms infuriated Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple's.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \"We Get It,\" meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>Then Facebook went on the offensive. Kaplan prevailed on Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company's US lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians' use of Facebook.</p><p>The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Virginia. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients' enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p>Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Cook's criticism upset Facebook.</p><p>If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \"muddy the waters,\" Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, California, bar last month.</p><p>In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \"Here Together,\" to apologise to its users.</p><p>Days before Zuckerberg's appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>But Zuckerberg's goodwill tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company's communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing.</p><p>But they worried he had come off as robotic ??? a suspicion confirmed by Facebook's pollsters.</p><p>Zuckerberg's political instincts were no more well-tuned.</p><p>During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Representative Greg Walden, who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p>Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook's leader, Walden realised, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>Some colleagues believed that Sandberg ??? whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company ??? was protecting her own brand at Facebook's expense.</p><p>At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>So Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its workforce than to those of powerful committee leaders.</p><p>Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook's previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers ??? partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers ??? executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>In July, organisers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organisers held aloft signs depicting Sandberg and Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organisation, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p>That afternoon, the ADL issued a warning from its Twitter account.</p><p>\"Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\" the organisation wrote. \"Protest Facebook ??? or anyone ??? all you want, but pick a different image.\" The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \"extreme anti-Israel groups.\"</p><p>An ADL spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \"Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\" Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticised Facebook, including when Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p>He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \"menace\" with \"neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\"</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Soros' family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organisation, as well as a progressive group founded by Soros' son. The research documents also highlighted those groups' unrelated criticisms of Trump. (Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.)</p><p>In at least one instance, the company also relied on Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>In July, as Facebook's troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Schumer confronted Warner, by then Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>Back off, he told Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Schumer's intervention. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Schumer's efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>Schumer declined to comment on the conversation. A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Schumer had not wanted Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook's Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>But Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee ??? a pivotal encounter for her embattled company ??? and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>Inside the room, they laboured to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialised in training corporate executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Burr, who was determined to avoid a circus-like atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labelled \"Google.\" Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive.</p><p>Dorsey showed up. Page did not.</p><p>As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook's rival.</p><p>Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>In large letters were her stage directions: \"Slow, Pause, Determined.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York Times</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520073453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRK-8X81-DY19-C35G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5022\"/><timeReceived>10:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Facebook went on the attack.</p><p>While Zuckerberg conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros.</p><p>It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>This account of how Zuckerberg and Sandberg navigated Facebook's cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people.</p><p>They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members.</p><p>Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorised to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Zuckerberg and Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>\"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\" the statement said. \"While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\"</p><p>Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed.</p><p>Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook's conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability.</p><p>Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a years-long struggle over the future of Facebook's data-hungry business model.</p><p>\"We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\" Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.</p><p>Zuckerberg, 34, and Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm, while Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook's priorities.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 per cent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>His answer each time: a resounding \"No.\"</p><p>Three years ago, Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary success.</p><p>Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, Lean In, in 2013.</p><p>Like other technology executives, Zuckerberg and Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good.</p><p>Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected.\"</p><p>But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform.</p><p>When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them.</p><p>Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher.</p><p>Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>Then Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on Muslims entering the United States.</p><p>Trump's call to arms ??? widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans ??? was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation.</p><p>He asked Sandberg and other executives if Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.</p><p>The question was unusual. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Sandberg's domain.</p><p>In 2010, Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook's chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p>Some at Facebook viewed Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform.</p><p>But Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of global policy.</p><p>Sandberg also turned to the Washington office ??? particularly to Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if the post, or Trump's account, violated Facebook's rules.</p><p>Kaplan argued that Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He also said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>\"Don't poke the bear,\" Kaplan warned.</p><p>In the final months of Trump's presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Stamos.</p><p>Stamos' team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees.</p><p>Months later, as Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations.</p><p>At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook.</p><p>In December 2016, after Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Trump, Stamos ??? alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings ??? met with Zuckerberg, Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p>Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>Still, Sandberg and Zuckerberg decided to expand on Stamos' work, creating a group called Project P, for \"propaganda,\" to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions.</p><p>By January 2017, the group knew that Stamos' original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>But Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by US intelligence agencies that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Trump.</p><p>If Facebook implicated Russia further, Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>Sandberg sided with Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Zuckerberg ??? who spent much of 2017 on a national \"listening tour,\" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota ??? did not participate in the conversations about the public paper.</p><p>When it was published that April, the word \"Russia\" never appeared.</p><p>Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner.</p><p>Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.</p><p>But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance.</p><p>By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \"five-alarm fire,\" said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on September 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p>After Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific.</p><p>She and Zuckerberg also asked Stamos and Stretch to brief the board's audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>Stretch and Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>The disclosures set off Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react.</p><p>He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference.</p><p>He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.</p><p>When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Bowles pelted questions at Facebook's founder and second-in-command.</p><p>Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologised. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 ??? a relatively tiny sum ??? on approximately 3000 ads.</p><p>Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission, The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference.</p><p>Republicans, already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative views, accused Facebook of fuelling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Trump and Russia.</p><p>Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Trump's win partly on Facebook's tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress.</p><p>Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>The same month, Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites ??? a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>\"It's time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians and paid for in Rubles during the last election,\" Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>Sandberg also reached out to Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Klobuchar's 2015 memoir, and the senator's chief of staff had previously worked at Sandberg's charitable foundation.</p><p>But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Sandberg complained about Klobuchar's attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation.</p><p>But she dialled down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>A spokesman for Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook's lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \"Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\" he said.</p><p>In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company.</p><p>Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialised in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations ??? an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>In March, The Times and The Observer/Guardian prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Zuckerberg and Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>\"We're not going to traffic in your personal life,\" Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \"Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.\" (Cook's criticisms infuriated Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple's.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \"We Get It,\" meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>Then Facebook went on the offensive. Kaplan prevailed on Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company's US lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians' use of Facebook.</p><p>The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Virginia. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients' enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p>Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Cook's criticism upset Facebook.</p><p>If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \"muddy the waters,\" Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, California, bar last month.</p><p>In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \"Here Together,\" to apologize to its users.</p><p>Days before Zuckerberg's appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>But Zuckerberg's goodwill tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company's communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing.</p><p>But they worried he had come off as robotic ??? a suspicion confirmed by Facebook's pollsters.</p><p>Zuckerberg's political instincts were no more well-tuned.</p><p>During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Representative Greg Walden, who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p>Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook's leader, Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>Some colleagues believed that Sandberg ??? whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company ??? was protecting her own brand at Facebook's expense.</p><p>At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>So Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its workforce than to those of powerful committee leaders.</p><p>Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook's previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers ??? partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers ??? executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>In July, organisers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organisers held aloft signs depicting Sandberg and Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organisation, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p>That afternoon, the ADL issued a warning from its Twitter account.</p><p>\"Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\" the organisation wrote. \"Protest Facebook ??? or anyone ??? all you want, but pick a different image.\" The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \"extreme anti-Israel groups.\"</p><p>An ADL spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \"Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\" Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticised Facebook, including when Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p>He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \"menace\" with \"neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\"</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Soros' family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organisation, as well as a progressive group founded by Soros' son. The research documents also highlighted those groups' unrelated criticisms of Trump. (Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.)</p><p>In at least one instance, the company also relied on Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>In July, as Facebook's troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Schumer confronted Warner, by then Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>Back off, he told Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Schumer's intervention. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Schumer's efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>Schumer declined to comment on the conversation. A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Schumer had not wanted Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook's Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>But Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee ??? a pivotal encounter for her embattled company ??? and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>Inside the room, they laboured to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialised in training corporate executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labelled \"Google.\" Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive.</p><p>Dorsey showed up. Page did not.</p><p>As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook's rival.</p><p>Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>In large letters were her stage directions: \"Slow, Pause, Determined.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York Times</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520073453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRC-GCK1-DY19-C46P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5021\"/><timeReceived>12:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Facebook went on the attack.</p><p>While Zuckerberg conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros.</p><p>It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>This account of how Zuckerberg and Sandberg navigated Facebook's cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people.</p><p>They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members.</p><p>Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorised to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Zuckerberg and Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>\"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\" the statement said. \"While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\"</p><p>Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed.</p><p>Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook's conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability.</p><p>Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a years-long struggle over the future of Facebook's data-hungry business model.</p><p>\"We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\" Elliot Schrage, former vice-president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.</p><p>Zuckerberg, 34, and Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm, while Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook's priorities.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 per cent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>His answer each time: a resounding \"No.\"</p><p>Three years ago, Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary success.</p><p>Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, Lean In, in 2013.</p><p>Like other technology executives, Zuckerberg and Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good.</p><p>Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected.\"</p><p>But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform.</p><p>When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them.</p><p>Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher.</p><p>Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>Then Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on Muslims entering the United States.</p><p>Trump's call to arms ??? widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans ??? was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation.</p><p>He asked Sandberg and other executives if Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.</p><p>The question was unusual. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Sandberg's domain.</p><p>In 2010, Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook's chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p>Some at Facebook viewed Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform.</p><p>But Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of global policy.</p><p>Sandberg also turned to the Washington office ??? particularly to Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if the post, or Trump's account, violated Facebook's rules.</p><p>Kaplan argued that Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He also said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>\"Don't poke the bear,\" Kaplan warned.</p><p>In the final months of Trump's presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Stamos.</p><p>Stamos' team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees.</p><p>Months later, as Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations.</p><p>At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinise the extent of Russian activity on Facebook.</p><p>In December 2016, after Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Trump, Stamos ??? alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings ??? met with Zuckerberg, Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p>Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>Still, Sandberg and Zuckerberg decided to expand on Stamos' work, creating a group called Project P, for \"propaganda,\" to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions.</p><p>By January 2017, the group knew that Stamos' original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>But Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by US intelligence agencies that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Trump.</p><p>If Facebook implicated Russia further, Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>Sandberg sided with Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Zuckerberg ??? who spent much of 2017 on a national \"listening tour,\" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota ??? did not participate in the conversations about the public paper.</p><p>When it was published that April, the word \"Russia\" never appeared.</p><p>Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner.</p><p>Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.</p><p>But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance.</p><p>By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \"five-alarm fire,\" said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on September 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p>After Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific.</p><p>She and Zuckerberg also asked Stamos and Stretch to brief the board's audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>Stretch and Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>The disclosures set off Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react.</p><p>He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference.</p><p>He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.</p><p>When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Bowles pelted questions at Facebook's founder and second-in-command.</p><p>Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologised. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 ??? a relatively tiny sum ??? on approximately 3000 ads.</p><p>Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission, The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference.</p><p>Republicans, already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative views, accused Facebook of fuelling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Trump and Russia.</p><p>Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Trump's win partly on Facebook's tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress.</p><p>Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>The same month, Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites ??? a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>\"It's time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians and paid for in Rubles during the last election,\" Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>Sandberg also reached out to Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Klobuchar's 2015 memoir, and the senator's chief of staff had previously worked at Sandberg's charitable foundation.</p><p>But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Sandberg complained about Klobuchar's attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation.</p><p>But she dialled down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>A spokesman for Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook's lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \"Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\" he said.</p><p>In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company.</p><p>Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialised in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations ??? an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favour of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>In March, The Times and The Observer/Guardian prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Zuckerberg and Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>\"We're not going to traffic in your personal life,\" Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \"Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.\" (Cook's criticisms infuriated Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple's.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \"We Get It,\" meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>Then Facebook went on the offensive. Kaplan prevailed on Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company's US lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians' use of Facebook.</p><p>The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Virginia. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients' enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p>Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Cook's criticism upset Facebook.</p><p>If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \"muddy the waters,\" Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, California, bar last month.</p><p>In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \"Here Together,\" to apologise to its users.</p><p>Days before Zuckerberg's appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>But Zuckerberg's goodwill tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company's communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing.</p><p>But they worried he had come off as robotic ??? a suspicion confirmed by Facebook's pollsters.</p><p>Zuckerberg's political instincts were no more well-tuned.</p><p>During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Representative Greg Walden, who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p>Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook's leader, Walden realised, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>Some colleagues believed that Sandberg ??? whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company ??? was protecting her own brand at Facebook's expense.</p><p>At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>So Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its workforce than to those of powerful committee leaders.</p><p>Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook's previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers ??? partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers ??? executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>In July, organisers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organisers held aloft signs depicting Sandberg and Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organisation, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p>That afternoon, the ADL issued a warning from its Twitter account.</p><p>\"Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\" the organisation wrote. \"Protest Facebook ??? or anyone ??? all you want, but pick a different image.\" The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \"extreme anti-Israel groups.\"</p><p>An ADL spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \"Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\" Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticised Facebook, including when Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p>He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \"menace\" with \"neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\"</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Soros' family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organisation, as well as a progressive group founded by Soros' son. The research documents also highlighted those groups' unrelated criticisms of Trump. (Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.)</p><p>In at least one instance, the company also relied on Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>In July, as Facebook's troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Schumer confronted Warner, by then Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>Back off, he told Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Schumer's intervention. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Schumer's efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>Schumer declined to comment on the conversation. A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Schumer had not wanted Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook's Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>But Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee ??? a pivotal encounter for her embattled company ??? and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>Inside the room, they laboured to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialised in training corporate executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Burr, who was determined to avoid a circus-like atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labelled \"Google.\" Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive.</p><p>Dorsey showed up. Page did not.</p><p>As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook's rival.</p><p>Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>In large letters were her stage directions: \"Slow, Pause, Determined.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York Times</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520073453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRG-XVX1-DY19-C1X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5022\"/><timeReceived>10:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Congressional and federal investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the company. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But it wasn't the looming disaster at <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos's briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''You threw us under the bus!'' she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.</p><p>  The clash that day would set off a reckoning -- for Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.</p><p>  [Here's how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>failed to police how its partners handled user data.]</p><p>  But as evidence accumulated that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.</p><p>  When <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.</p><p>  And when that failed -- as the company's stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash -- <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>went on the attack.</p><p>  While Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>  In Washington, allies of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>  This account of how Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg navigated <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>declined to make Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>  ''This has been a tough time at <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,'' the statement said. ''While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.''</p><p>  Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>data-hungry business model.</p><p>  [Despite a turbulent two years, here's why almost no one in tech thinks <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>should step down from the company he built.]</p><p>  ''We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,'' Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>said in an interview.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>34, and Ms. Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm, while Mr. Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>priorities. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who controls the social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>  His answer each time: a resounding ''No.''</p><p>  'Don't Poke the Bear'</p><p>  Three years ago, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who founded <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, ''Lean In,'' in 2013.</p><p>  Like other technology executives, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: ''Our mission is to make the world more open and connected.''</p><p>  But as <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>  Then Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>calling for a ''total and complete shutdown'' on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump's call to arms -- widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans -- was shared more than 15,000 times on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>terms of service.</p><p>  The question was unusual. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg's domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.</p><p>  Some at <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>viewed Mr. Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform. But Ms. Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Mr. Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Ms. Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of global policy management. Ms. Sandberg also turned to the Washington office -- particularly to Mr. Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>  In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump's account, violated <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>rules.</p><p>  Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He also said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>  ''Don't poke the bear,'' Mr. Kaplan warned.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.</p><p>  Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump's language had not violated <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>rules and that the candidate's views had public value. ''We were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,'' he said in an interview.</p><p>  In the end, Mr. Trump's statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump's new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.</p><p>  But inside <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>new troubles were brewing.</p><p>  Minimizing Russia's Role</p><p>  In the final months of Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.</p><p>  Mr. Stamos's team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>  Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>  Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>In December 2016, after Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos -- alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings -- met with Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Ms. Sandberg and other top <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>leaders.</p><p>  Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>  Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>decided to expand on Mr. Stamos's work, creating a group called Project P, for ''propaganda,'' to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos's original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>  But Mr. Kaplan and other <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.</p><p>  If <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>  Ms. Sandberg sided with Mr. Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>-- who spent much of 2017 on a national ''listening tour,'' feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota -- did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was  published that April, the word ''Russia'' never appeared.</p><p>  Ms. Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a ''five-alarm fire,'' said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p>  After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board's audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>  Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>  The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>directors were only now being told.</p><p>  When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>  Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 -- a relatively tiny sum -- on approximately 3,000 ads.</p><p>  Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission, The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>  A Political Playbook</p><p>  The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans, already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative views, accused <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>of fueling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Mr. Trump and Russia. Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Mr. Trump's win partly on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>  After stalling for weeks, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>  The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites -- a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>  ''It's time for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,'' Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hired Mr. Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's Washington response, routinely reviewing <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>  Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar's 2015 memoir, and the senator's chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg's charitable foundation.</p><p>  But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar's attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>repeatedly that fall on her own <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>  A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. ''<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,'' he said.</p><p>  In October 2017, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations -- an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>  Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to ''have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.</p><p>  When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to ''make sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.''</p><p>  Opposition Research</p><p>  In March, The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian prepared to publish a joint investigation into how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>with evidence that copies of improperly acquired <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>  They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>  ''We're not going to traffic in your personal life,'' Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. ''Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.'' (Mr. Cook's criticisms infuriated Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones -- arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple's.)</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called ''We Get It,'' meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>  Then <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company's American lobbying efforts. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>  On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians' use of <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients' enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.</p><p>  Mr. Miller acknowledged that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Apple do not directly compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook's criticism upset <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  If the privacy issue comes up, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is happy to ''muddy the waters,'' Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.</p><p>  In public, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was more conciliatory. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled ''Here Together,'' to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>appearance in Congress in April, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>  But Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company's communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic -- a suspicion confirmed by <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>pollsters.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>Democrats had been.</p><p>  Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>  Personal Appeals in Washington</p><p>  Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems. But inside <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>  Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg -- whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company -- was protecting her own brand at <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>  So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>  Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee's Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.</p><p>  She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was eager to head off further trouble.</p><p>  The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about ''corporate citizenship in the digital age'' and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>  While <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.</p><p>  Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg's presence -- companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings -- persuaded others that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers -- partnerships <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had failed to disclose to lawmakers -- executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>  In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>  Deflecting Criticism</p><p>  By then, some of the harshest criticism of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>  In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>  Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.</p><p>  That afternoon, the A.D.L. issued a warning from its Twitter account.</p><p>  ''Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,'' the organization wrote. ''Protest <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>-- or anyone -- all you want, but pick a different image.'' The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to what the publication calls ''extreme anti-Israel groups.''</p><p>  An A.D.L. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. ''Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,'' Ms. Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticized <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>including when Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>movement.</p><p>  He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google, describing them as a monopolist ''menace'' with ''neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.''</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros's family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros's son. (An official at Mr. Soros's Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>and had made no grants to support campaigns against <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person>)</p><p>Definers also circulated research about other critics of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  In at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr. Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>  Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>  In July, as <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>  Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employee briefed on Mr. Schumer's intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer's efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>  A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>  The War Room</p><p>  One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>  But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee -- a pivotal encounter for her embattled company -- and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>  Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>  In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled ''Google.'' <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive.</p><p>  Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.</p><p>  As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>rival.</p><p>  Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>  In large letters were her stage directions: ''Slow, Pause, Determined.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg, </nameText></person>top officials of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>told senators this year that the company was making changes.

When the rulings were released[1], neither those seeking the records nor Trump got all of what they wanted. In a 7-2 ruling, the justices held that New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance had a valid subpoena[2], disallowing Trump's claim of total immunity. At the same time, they said the President and his lawyers could challenge the subpoenas on other grounds in the lower courts.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cy-vance.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cy-vance.jpg</url> The Supreme Court held that New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance has a valid subpoena for Donald Trump's financial records. The other case, decided by another 7-2 ruling, reversed lower court verdicts and blocked three House committees[3] from receiving the records, saying the lower courts did not give separation of powers between the branches of government proper deference. The House is free to re-litigate, but the chance of having the tax records before November is next to zero. Any ruling that would have allowed the tax records to be released would have dominated a news cycle, but the lack of public responses from within the delegation showed neither side gained a clear advantage. Democratic leaders said 'no one is above the law,' but little else. <url normalizedValue=\"http://perspecta.com/Florida?The\">http://perspecta.com/Florida?The</url> chance of New York prosecutors eventually getting the records is now enhanced, but with Trump's team of lawyers able to make new arguments, they may be able to run out the clock through his term. Despite this, the President was furious, launching into a stream of tweets. 'Courts in the past have given 'broad deference.' BUT NOT ME!' was one of them[4]. Another made a comparison, speaking of 'PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT[5]' carried out against him and 'SPYING on my campaign and NOTHING HAPPENS.' Perhaps one of the factors enraging the President was seeing his two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, siding with Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal justices that included Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 'In our judicial system, 'the public has a right to every man's evidence.' Since the earliest days of the Republic, 'every man' has included the President of the United States,' Roberts wrote in the New York case. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito were the two dissenters, but for other reasons. Even they did not buy into the absolute immunity claim. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tgh.org/In\">https://www.tgh.org/In</url> the Congressional committee case, Roberts wrote that there are avenues for Congress to seek such records, but they are not automatically entitled to them just because they want them. 'Without limits on its subpoena powers, Congress could 'exert an imperious control' over the Executive Branch and aggrandize itself at the President's expense, just as the Framers feared,' Roberts wrote. 'And a limitless subpoena power would transform the 'established practice' of the political branches.' With the term now ended, speculation on retirements now picks up. Rumors have swirled around Thomas or maybe Alito leaving the bench. The health of Ginsberg, who recently turned 87, is a constant concern. If there is a vacancy, the process of Trump nominating a successor and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even considering holding confirmation hearings would be a political war for the ages, even dwarfing the confirmation circus surrounding Kavanagh. That name, and the name of Merrick Garland[6], would again rock Capitol Hill as the November elections approached. Purging regulations Republicans often rally around efforts to reduce government regulations and this week provided another opportunity. Sen. Rick Scott joined with seven GOP colleagues to introduce the Unnecessary Agency Regulations Reduction Act[7] to 'reduce burdensome regulations and create more efficiency.' 'Throughout my time as Governor of Florida, we cut more than 5,200 burdensome regulations to get government out of the way so businesses could succeed,' Scott said in a news release announcing the bill. 'Our focus on reducing taxes and cutting regulations meant more than 1.7 million new jobs were created in our state. The Unnecessary Regulations Reduction Act helps bring Florida's success to Washington by creating more efficiency in the federal government.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rick-scott-says-the-bill-of-rights-trumps-all-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rick-scott-says-the-bill-of-rights-trumps-all-1.jpg</url> Rick Scott is leading the effort to purge unnecessary regulation. Image via AP. The legislation creates a process to eliminate multiple regulations and requires the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to submit a list of outdated, duplicative or burdensome agency regulations to modify, consolidate or repeal on an annual basis. The list of recommendations would be included in the President's Unified Agenda[8]. The list will then be transmitted to the relevant congressional committees to review and the final list of recommendations will be introduced as a joint resolution, which is eligible for expedited consideration in Congress. 'We have to do everything we can to protect taxpayer dollars and rein in wasteful spending, and eliminating unnecessary regulations is an easy way to do that,' Scott added. The bill's co-sponsors are Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. PPP loans scrutinized A few weeks ago, Sen. Marco Rubio foretold the day when the Small Business Administration (SBA) would release data on who received Paycheck Protection Program[9] (PPP) loans. That day came this week as the agency provided information[10] on recipients receiving over $150,000 that include what businesses received and the number of jobs saved. 'Today, the administration has provided much-needed transparency to the American people on the Paycheck Protection Program,' said Rubio, who chairs the Small Business Committee. 'We know PPP has been a historic lifeline for more than 4.8 million small businesses. It is clear that financial damage from the pandemic will continue to impact small businesses even as the economy reopens.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marcorubio-8.28.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marcorubio-8.28.jpg</url> Marco Rubio is praising 'transparency' in the PPP loan program. But the list draws more questions than answers. Numerous stories dotted the media about businesses owned by prominent individuals lawfully receiving loans, with other recipients drawing questions. Those recipients came from both parties[11]. Car dealerships owned by Sarasota Republican Vern Buchanan received $7 million, while the senior home care company co-owned by Fort Walton Beach Republican Matt Gaetz received between $350,000 and 1 million. The accounting firm employing the Republican Party of Florida Chair Joe Gruters received between $150,000 and $300,000. Each met the primary requirement of being a small business and keeping employees on the payroll. Other recipients are drawing questions[12]. The Florida Democratic Party Building Fund received between $350,000 and $1 million to secure the jobs of 100 employees, but Republicans are looking into a challenge because party-building funds are supposedly ineligible. At the same time, the Black Republican Caucus of Florida received a loan between $150,000 to $350,000 despite not reporting any contributions or expenditures in 2020. Some are touting the impact the loans had on their districts. For example, Palm City Republican Brian Mast pointed to 65,726 jobs saved, 16,500+ loans received totaling $542 million in economic support for Florida's 18th Congressional District. He said it is 'making a real difference[13] in our community.' Grilling 'Big Tech' Subcommittee meetings are normally routine affairs that do not generate a lot of news. That is not likely to be the case when the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee[14] holds a hearing July 27 with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google Tim Cook from Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google will testify as part of an ongoing investigation into compliance with antitrust laws by digital platforms. Rep. Matt Gaetz cannot wait.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Gaetz-unveils-bill-to-deport-all-illegal-immigrants-during.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Gaetz-unveils-bill-to-deport-all-illegal-immigrants-during.jpg</url> Matt Gaetz is waiting to take a shot at 'Big Tech.' Gaetz, a member of the subcommittee, believes these companies and others are harming American entrepreneurs and enriching themselves by their tactics. 'There are circumstances and experiences that we have uncovered in our investigation where people submit their products and then Amazon finds a way to steal the IP, replicate the tech, and then provide the product at a lower cost, harming the innovator who is often American and benefiting a manufacturer willing to cheat, often in China,' Gaetz said this week on his podcast[15]. Another issue Gaetz seeks to address is 'the extent to which entities like Google and Facebook, in particular, curate the information that they want and enhance it, and then suppress the information that is not consistent with their political beliefs.' He is focused on politics and antitrust, noting the bipartisan investigation is seeking to determine how much partisan politics plays among the activities of the major platforms. '(T)he laws that we have do give us tools to go in and modify conduct and modify the consumer experience,' he said. 'The question will be whether or not we have the bipartisan will to execute on those existing laws. It will be a historic hearing in the Congress. I'll be there and I can't wait to fight for consumers and to fight for freedom online.' Also questioning the witnesses will be the delegation's other members of the subcommittee, Sarasota Republican Greg Steube and Orlando Democrat Val Demings. Sanctioning China As Hong Kong steadily slips under the total domain of China, there is little the U.S. can do to change that dynamic. Congress has used its limited influence by approving new Hong Kong- related sanctions. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act[16], of which Rep. Ted Yoho is an original co-sponsor, was passed unanimously in both the House and Senate. It is now on the President's desk waiting to be signed into law. Yoho basically told Trump to hurry up.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP-Hong-Kong.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP-Hong-Kong.jpeg</url> Ted Yoho is calling for Hong Kong autonomy. But there seems to be little the U.S. can do. Image via AP. 'As the #CCP[17] tightens its grip on the people of #HongKong[18], the world must hold them accountable, Yoho tweeted[19]. 'It is time to sign the Hong Kong Autonomy Act into law and #[20]StandWithHongKong[21].' The legislation would impose sanctions on banks that do business with Chinese officials involved in the crackdown of pro-democracy protesters in Hong-Kong. The President would be authorized to impose property-blocking sanctions on identified individuals or entities, as well as visa-blocking sanctions on a named individual. 'The Hong Kong we see today is unrecognizable from before, where 'One Country, Two Systems' has been forcibly molded into 'One Country, One System,' Yoho tweeted[22] upon the bill's passage. Cuba, speaking on behalf of 53 countries at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council, defended China's new law[23] against the citizens of Hong Kong, saying 'every country has the right to safeguard its national security through legislation, and commend relevant steps taken for this purpose.' Yoho, the ranking member of the subcommittee overseeing Asia and the Pacific, was also an original co-sponsor of the Human Rights and Democracy Act[24] that was signed into law last year. The bill supported the protesters in Hong Kong. China exploiting COVID House moderates have introduced legislation designed to protect the U.S. from actual or potential manipulation of the coronavirus by China. The legislation[25], with Rep. Stephanie Murphy serving as one of two original co-sponsors, requires the U.S. government to identify, analyze, and combat efforts by the Chinese government to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Bipartisan concerns in Congress about Chinese government policies have only increased once COVID-19 emerged in China and spread to virtually every country in the world, Murphy said in a news release. 'Since the start of this pandemic, we have witnessed a pattern of alarming behavior from the Chinese government in a range of areas.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GETTY-stephanie-murphy-031820.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GETTY-stephanie-murphy-031820.jpg</url> Stephanie Murphy serves as one of the original co-sponsors of the bill to protect the U.S. from Chinese manipulation of coronavirus. Image via Getty. The bill requires the Director of National Intelligence \u2014 in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense, State and Homeland Security \u2014 to prepare an assessment within 90 days of enactment of the different ways in which the Chinese government has exploited or could exploit the pandemic. Murphy and her colleagues note COVID-19 originated in China and seek intelligence on how the Chinese sought to take advantage of the situation to advance China's interests and to undermine the interests of the United States, its allies, and the rules-based international order. The bill is sponsored by Oklahoma Democrat Kendra Horn with New York Democrat Max Rose joining Murphy as prime co-sponsor. All are members of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition[26], which has endorsed the bill. 'This bill would provide U.S. policymakers with an intelligence community assessment of the different ways the Chinese government may be seeking to exploit the pandemic,' Murphy, a Blue Dog Coalition co-chair, added. 'Armed with this information, we can hold the Chinese government accountable and protect American interests.' Also co-sponsoring the legislation is the delegation's other Blue Dog member, Rep. Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg. Restocking remdesivir This week, Crist led delegation Democrats in penning a letter[27] to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar underlining the urgency of the COVID-19 epidemic. The letter said that hospitalizations in Florida are 'trending precariously higher' and noted that the Florida Department of Health has informed pharmacies that it has temporarily exhausted its supply of remdesivir, a drug used by hospitals to shorten the duration of COVID-19.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/azar-alex.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/azar-alex.jpg</url> Charlie Crist is submitting a request to HHS Sec. Alex Azar to replenish Florida's supply of remdesivir. 'According to health professionals we are hearing from, people will die without replenished stock of treatment,' the letter reads. 'Recently, the State of Florida requested additional, emergency supplies of remdesivir from HHS, and we strongly urge you to expedite consideration of this request.' The letter also said that Florida is implementing a new distribution model for the drug that will go into effect July 13, and it called for Azar to provide specific details so Floridians can be confident that they will have access to treatment. 'A clear and transparent process is in the best interest of patients,' it said. 'With time of the essence, we appreciate your immediate consideration of these urgent matters.' The following day, a new supply of remdesivir arrived, prompting a word of thanks. 'Grateful to @CDCDirector[28] Redfield, @SeemaCMS[29], and Dr. Deborah Birx for swiftly answering FL Democratic delegation's call for an emergency distribution of lifesaving COVID-19 treatment remdesivir,' Crist tweeted. Doubling down on hope Rep. Kathy Castor is bringing federal aid to people who sorely need it. Castor announced Thursday that a Tampa-based organization \u2014 the Tampa Bay Academy of Hope \u2014 will receive a $4 million federal grant through the Department of Labor's Pathway Home[30] program. The grant is meant to assist in the transition of justice-oriented adults back to the workplace, and the Tampa Bay Academy of Hope[31] was one of 20 recipients nationwide. 'We are a community that says we are here to help you do better on your pathway ahead,' Castor said. 'The Tampa Bay Academy of Hope continues to expand and establish a track record of success thanks to our partnership and federal support that this year will provide a big boost in investment for its job skills development and support services offered for returning citizens.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna</url> -ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/castor-Tom-WilliamsCQ-Roll-CallNewscom.jpg Kathy Castor is coming through with federal aid for people who need it most. Image via CQ/Roll Call.;; The Academy has received similar grants of $1.5 million over the course of the last five years, but it hopes to use the increased funding to more than double its footprint. The Tampa Bay Academy of Hope currently serves 188 citizens in Hillsborough County, and it believes it can reach 563 people if it moves into neighboring Pasco County. The Academy has worked directly with youth in schools or young adults in prisons, but during the pandemic, it has moved to online jobs training and live coaching to maintain its level of services. 'We offer support to grow all the way around, but sustainable employment is the ultimate goal,' said Titania Lamb, executive director of Tampa Bay Academy of Hope. Stopping pandemic pill-popping A spike in opioid deaths has Sarasota Republican Vern Buchanan pursuing new federal funding to face the issue. He sounded alarms when the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office reported 29 fatalities over the first six months of 2020; there were 13 over the same time span 2019. In Manatee, once Florida's epicenter for opioid deaths, fatalities also climbed from 46 in the first half of 2019 to 49 this year. 'The spike in drug overdoses in our region during the coronavirus pandemic is tragic and alarming,' Buchanan said. 'We have to get treatment to those in need both in Southwest Florida and across the country. As we continue to combat the coronavirus we need to make sure we are addressing other health impacts exacerbated by this pandemic.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-5.49.17-PM.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-5.49.17-PM.png</url> An increase in opioid deaths prompts Vern Buchanan to seek additional funding for the issue Buchanan's office said there seems to be a direct line to isolation and depression around COVID-19 isolation and a spike in drug abuse. Lockdowns have also resulted in many treatment centers in the region closing down or scaling back. As Congress debates another coronavirus relief bill, Buchanan said mental health funding must be part of the mix. Nationwide, overdoses have climbed each month of the pandemic \u2014 18% in March, 29% in April and 42% in May \u2014 according to the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program. 'The opioid crisis has destroyed too many families and lives,' he said. 'We cannot forget about this crisis even during the coronavirus pandemic.' So long, WHO? This week, Trump followed through on a promise when he announced he was beginning the process to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO)[32]. While the President has some support within his party, others disagreed with the move. The WHO has faced criticism for failing to provide clear and consistent advice and been accused of 'siding with China.' Sarasota Republican Greg Steube is among those supporting Trump's action for those reasons.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Steube.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Steube.jpg</url> Greg Steube says adios to the World Health Organization. 'The WHO prioritized the Communist Chinese government and failed to protect the world from this pandemic,' he tweeted[33] earlier this week. 'It is right for President Donald Trump to stop sending billions of American taxpayer dollars to this corrupt organization.' Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is making a mistake. 'Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,' Alexander said in a statement. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden pledged to reverse Trump's action if he wins in November. Skirting SCOTUS ruling Besides the Trump tax return cases, other highly-anticipated decisions emerged this week. In one case, the ruled religious-based employers objecting to providing contraceptive health coverage[34] through the Affordable Care Act, are now not required to do so. The 7-2 ruling in the case where the original plaintiffs were the Little Sisters of the Poor, upheld expansions by the Trump administration that added exemptions for other employers using 'moral beliefs.' The administration's rules brought about the suit that finally ended this week, much to the delight of most Republicans and the pro-life movement. Many Democrats in Congress were upset with the ruling, including some that seek to thwart Trump and skirt the court's ruling. Rep. Lois Frankel joined three of her colleagues to file the Protect Access to Birth Control Act[35] within minutes of the court decision. The legislation seeks the repeal of the Trump administration rules before they can take effect.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lois-frankel.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lois-frankel.jpg</url> Lois Frankel is looking to skirt a Supreme Court decision with legislation to protect access to birth control. 'We aren't going to sit back and allow this court, or this administration, to put the health and well-being of millions of Americans at risk,' the lawmakers said. 'We are going to continue to fight against these dangerous rules in any way we can.' Alito wrote the opinion[36] for the majority, which included the conservative bloc of four justices plus Roberts. Also concurring with the opinion were liberal justices Breyer and Kagan. Panama City Republican Neal Dunn was among those praising the ruling, calling it 'not just a win for religious liberty, but also for life.' Weston Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Democratic Rep. Al Lawson of Tallahassee strongly disagreed. Lawson said 'SCOTUS got it wrong[37],' while Wasserman Schultz had harsh words for the ruling and the plaintiffs. 'Allowing employers to opt-out of the ACA birth control mandate is not an expression of religious liberty, but an act of discrimination,' she tweeted[38]. 'Reproductive health is health care.' Withholding building funds The effort to force changes of military bases named after prominent confederates continues; this time through the use of financial disincentives. The latest effort calls for withholding military construction funds[39] from those installations that have failed to have at least begun a renaming process. Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the subcommittee overseeing military construction funding, said the proposed 2021 appropriations for construction, veterans affairs and related items include the demand for name changes as well as other key provisions. 'Our brave service members should not have to live and train on bases named for traitors to the cause of creating a more perfect union,' the Weston Democrat said. 'Betraying the United States is not an act that should be honored, and it's beyond time for change at those military bases that do that with their namesake.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz.jpg</url> Debbie Wasserman Schultz is continuing the push to rename military bases, by withholding construction funds. The bill also provides $250.9 billion in both discretionary and mandatory funding, an increase of $15.2 billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. Funding for veterans programs includes $10.3 billion in mental health care services, including $313 million in suicide prevention outreach; $1.9 billion for homeless assistance programs; $661 million for gender-specific care for women; and $504 million for opioid abuse prevention. Wasserman Schultz and her committee are in agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has also called for the bases to be renamed. 'Along with other Democrats and Republicans who favor these changes, I will use all the tools in our legislative toolbox to rectify these misguided historical monikers,' she added. Trump has pledged a veto of any legislation requiring base name changes. Wilson antagonist sentenced One year ago, a federal defense contractor threatened the life[40] through a telephone message of Miami Gardens Democrat Frederica Wilson over her sponsorship for a bill calling for vaccinating school children. This week, the perpetrator learned his fate[41]. Darryl Albert Varnum admitted to U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett that he was intoxicated when he phoned in the death threat last year and says that he is ashamed of the impulsive act. He described his actions to Bennett as 'the worst mistake of my life.' Bennett sentenced Varnum to six months of home detention and an additional two months of court supervision. The sentencing guidelines called for a maximum of six months in prison.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wilson-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wilson-1.jpg</url> A man who threatened Frederica Wilson last year over a vaccination bill admits he was intoxicated at the time and was sentenced to six months of home detention. 'It was just so vile and so scary,' Wilson said. 'I was petrified.' Varnum also apologized to Wilson during the sentencing, but she was not on the video conference to hear it. Wilson said she was unaware of the hearing until a reporter called her asking for comment. 'I'm just wondering why,' she said. 'That's a law that I am supposed to be notified.' This is not the first time that Wilson has had a run-in with menacing calls and social media messages. In 2017, there was a disagreement with Trump[42] after Wilson blasted him for what she described as an insensitive phone call to the widow of a soldier killed in Niger. That prompted numerous calls and correspondence to Wilson from angry Trump supporters. 'That was a very scary time for me also,' she said. ICE changes rules Another controversy involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) involving foreign students is now raging. A new rule[43] tells nonimmigrant foreign students at institutions conducting classes exclusively online in the fall that they will need to transfer or leave the country[44]. The Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP), run by ICE, has granted exemptions due to the COVID-19 virus. The program announced this week that with only limited exceptions, those exemptions will not be renewed and nonimmigrant foreign students must transfer to institutions conducting at least some classes on campus.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shalala.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shalala.jpg</url> Donna Shalala is blasting a Donald Trump administration rule that threatens foreign students with expulsion from the country. Image via Getty. 'This policy is xenophobic and outrageous,' tweeted[45] Coral Gables Democrat Donna Shalala. 'This policy will have a dire effect across the entire U.S. higher education system and all students \u2014 regardless of their immigration status \u2014 will suffer.' Those deciding to stay in contravention of the new rule could face serious consequences. In the order, SEVP said students could face 'immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.' On this day July 10, 2013 \u2014 House Republicans are bucking Senate moderates and President George W. Bush over the Senate's immigration reform bill. President George W. Bush and Sen. Rubio, who co-sponsored the bill are on opposite sides of the GOP conservatives, who oppose 'amnesty' for those here illegally. Republicans say they do not trust President Barack Obama to secure the southern border should they agree to other measures dealing with legal and illegal immigration. Rubio has come under intraparty criticism for his role in developing the legislation. July 10, 2018 \u2014 One day after Trump nominated D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, both sides were gearing up for what is expected to be an intense confirmation battle in the Senate. Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, a member of the Judiciary Committee who will hold the confirmation hearing, predicted a 'rough, tough, down-in-the-dirt, ear-pulling, nose-biting fight.' Kavanaugh is replacing the retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's so-called swing vote. Before his career on the bench, Kavanaugh served as a lawyer; among his clients were the family of Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez, who was eventually taken from those relatives by federal forces with guns drawn April 22, 2000, and returned to his father in Cuba.

When the rulings were released[1], neither those seeking the records nor Trump got all of what they wanted. In a 7-2 ruling, the justices held that New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance had a valid subpoena[2], disallowing Trump's claim of total immunity. At the same time, they said the President and his lawyers could challenge the subpoenas on other grounds in the lower courts.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cy-vance.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cy-vance.jpg</url> The Supreme Court held that New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance has a valid subpoena for Donald Trump's financial records. The other case, decided by another 7-2 ruling, reversed lower court verdicts and blocked three House committees[3] from receiving the records, saying the lower courts did not give separation of powers between the branches of government proper deference. The House is free to re-litigate, but the chance of having the tax records before November is next to zero. Any ruling that would have allowed the tax records to be released would have dominated a news cycle, but the lack of public responses from within the delegation showed neither side gained a clear advantage. Democratic leaders said 'no one is above the law,' but little else. <url normalizedValue=\"http://perspecta.com/Florida?The\">http://perspecta.com/Florida?The</url> chance of New York prosecutors eventually getting the records is now enhanced, but with Trump's team of lawyers able to make new arguments, they may be able to run out the clock through his term. Despite this, the President was furious, launching into a stream of tweets. 'Courts in the past have given 'broad deference.' BUT NOT ME!' was one of them[4]. Another made a comparison, speaking of 'PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT[5]' carried out against him and 'SPYING on my campaign and NOTHING HAPPENS.' Perhaps one of the factors enraging the President was seeing his two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, siding with Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal justices that included Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 'In our judicial system, 'the public has a right to every man's evidence.' Since the earliest days of the Republic, 'every man' has included the President of the United States,' Roberts wrote in the New York case. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito were the two dissenters, but for other reasons. Even they did not buy into the absolute immunity claim. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tgh.org/In\">https://www.tgh.org/In</url> the Congressional committee case, Roberts wrote that there are avenues for Congress to seek such records, but they are not automatically entitled to them just because they want them. 'Without limits on its subpoena powers, Congress could 'exert an imperious control' over the Executive Branch and aggrandize itself at the President's expense, just as the Framers feared,' Roberts wrote. 'And a limitless subpoena power would transform the 'established practice' of the political branches.' With the term now ended, speculation on retirements now picks up. Rumors have swirled around Thomas or maybe Alito leaving the bench. The health of Ginsberg, who recently turned 87, is a constant concern. If there is a vacancy, the process of Trump nominating a successor and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even considering holding confirmation hearings would be a political war for the ages, even dwarfing the confirmation circus surrounding Kavanagh. That name, and the name of Merrick Garland[6], would again rock Capitol Hill as the November elections approached. Purging regulations Republicans often rally around efforts to reduce government regulations and this week provided another opportunity. Sen. Rick Scott joined with seven GOP colleagues to introduce the Unnecessary Agency Regulations Reduction Act[7] to 'reduce burdensome regulations and create more efficiency.' 'Throughout my time as Governor of Florida, we cut more than 5,200 burdensome regulations to get government out of the way so businesses could succeed,' Scott said in a news release announcing the bill. 'Our focus on reducing taxes and cutting regulations meant more than 1.7 million new jobs were created in our state. The Unnecessary Regulations Reduction Act helps bring Florida's success to Washington by creating more efficiency in the federal government.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rick-scott-says-the-bill-of-rights-trumps-all-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rick-scott-says-the-bill-of-rights-trumps-all-1.jpg</url> Rick Scott is leading the effort to purge unnecessary regulation. Image via AP. The legislation creates a process to eliminate multiple regulations and requires the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to submit a list of outdated, duplicative or burdensome agency regulations to modify, consolidate or repeal on an annual basis. The list of recommendations would be included in the President's Unified Agenda[8]. The list will then be transmitted to the relevant congressional committees to review and the final list of recommendations will be introduced as a joint resolution, which is eligible for expedited consideration in Congress. 'We have to do everything we can to protect taxpayer dollars and rein in wasteful spending, and eliminating unnecessary regulations is an easy way to do that,' Scott added. The bill's co-sponsors are Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. PPP loans scrutinized A few weeks ago, Sen. Marco Rubio foretold the day when the Small Business Administration (SBA) would release data on who received Paycheck Protection Program[9] (PPP) loans. That day came this week as the agency provided information[10] on recipients receiving over $150,000 that include what businesses received and the number of jobs saved. 'Today, the administration has provided much-needed transparency to the American people on the Paycheck Protection Program,' said Rubio, who chairs the Small Business Committee. 'We know PPP has been a historic lifeline for more than 4.8 million small businesses. It is clear that financial damage from the pandemic will continue to impact small businesses even as the economy reopens.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marcorubio-8.28.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marcorubio-8.28.jpg</url> Marco Rubio is praising 'transparency' in the PPP loan program. But the list draws more questions than answers. Numerous stories dotted the media about businesses owned by prominent individuals lawfully receiving loans, with other recipients drawing questions. Those recipients came from both parties[11]. Car dealerships owned by Sarasota Republican Vern Buchanan received $7 million, while the senior home care company co-owned by Fort Walton Beach Republican Matt Gaetz received between $350,000 and 1 million. The accounting firm employing the Republican Party of Florida Chair Joe Gruters received between $150,000 and $300,000. Each met the primary requirement of being a small business and keeping employees on the payroll. Other recipients are drawing questions[12]. The Florida Democratic Party Building Fund received between $350,000 and $1 million to secure the jobs of 100 employees, but Republicans are looking into a challenge because party-building funds are supposedly ineligible. At the same time, the Black Republican Caucus of Florida received a loan between $150,000 to $350,000 despite not reporting any contributions or expenditures in 2020. Some are touting the impact the loans had on their districts. For example, Palm City Republican Brian Mast pointed to 65,726 jobs saved, 16,500+ loans received totaling $542 million in economic support for Florida's 18th Congressional District. He said it is 'making a real difference[13] in our community.' Grilling 'Big Tech' Subcommittee meetings are normally routine affairs that do not generate a lot of news. That is not likely to be the case when the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee[14] holds a hearing July 27 with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google Tim Cook from Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google will testify as part of an ongoing investigation into compliance with antitrust laws by digital platforms. Rep. Matt Gaetz cannot wait.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Gaetz-unveils-bill-to-deport-all-illegal-immigrants-during.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Gaetz-unveils-bill-to-deport-all-illegal-immigrants-during.jpg</url> Matt Gaetz is waiting to take a shot at 'Big Tech.' Gaetz, a member of the subcommittee, believes these companies and others are harming American entrepreneurs and enriching themselves by their tactics. 'There are circumstances and experiences that we have uncovered in our investigation where people submit their products and then Amazon finds a way to steal the IP, replicate the tech, and then provide the product at a lower cost, harming the innovator who is often American and benefiting a manufacturer willing to cheat, often in China,' Gaetz said this week on his podcast[15]. Another issue Gaetz seeks to address is 'the extent to which entities like Google and Facebook, in particular, curate the information that they want and enhance it, and then suppress the information that is not consistent with their political beliefs.' He is focused on politics and antitrust, noting the bipartisan investigation is seeking to determine how much partisan politics plays among the activities of the major platforms. '(T)he laws that we have do give us tools to go in and modify conduct and modify the consumer experience,' he said. 'The question will be whether or not we have the bipartisan will to execute on those existing laws. It will be a historic hearing in the Congress. I'll be there and I can't wait to fight for consumers and to fight for freedom online.' Also questioning the witnesses will be the delegation's other members of the subcommittee, Sarasota Republican Greg Steube and Orlando Democrat Val Demings. Sanctioning China As Hong Kong steadily slips under the total domain of China, there is little the U.S. can do to change that dynamic. Congress has used its limited influence by approving new Hong Kong- related sanctions. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act[16], of which Rep. Ted Yoho is an original co-sponsor, was passed unanimously in both the House and Senate. It is now on the President's desk waiting to be signed into law. Yoho basically told Trump to hurry up.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP-Hong-Kong.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP-Hong-Kong.jpeg</url> Ted Yoho is calling for Hong Kong autonomy. But there seems to be little the U.S. can do. Image via AP. 'As the #CCP[17] tightens its grip on the people of #HongKong[18], the world must hold them accountable, Yoho tweeted[19]. 'It is time to sign the Hong Kong Autonomy Act into law and #[20]StandWithHongKong[21].' The legislation would impose sanctions on banks that do business with Chinese officials involved in the crackdown of pro-democracy protesters in Hong-Kong. The President would be authorized to impose property-blocking sanctions on identified individuals or entities, as well as visa-blocking sanctions on a named individual. 'The Hong Kong we see today is unrecognizable from before, where 'One Country, Two Systems' has been forcibly molded into 'One Country, One System,' Yoho tweeted[22] upon the bill's passage. Cuba, speaking on behalf of 53 countries at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council, defended China's new law[23] against the citizens of Hong Kong, saying 'every country has the right to safeguard its national security through legislation, and commend relevant steps taken for this purpose.' Yoho, the ranking member of the subcommittee overseeing Asia and the Pacific, was also an original co-sponsor of the Human Rights and Democracy Act[24] that was signed into law last year. The bill supported the protesters in Hong Kong. China exploiting COVID House moderates have introduced legislation designed to protect the U.S. from actual or potential manipulation of the coronavirus by China. The legislation[25], with Rep. Stephanie Murphy serving as one of two original co-sponsors, requires the U.S. government to identify, analyze, and combat efforts by the Chinese government to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Bipartisan concerns in Congress about Chinese government policies have only increased once COVID-19 emerged in China and spread to virtually every country in the world, Murphy said in a news release. 'Since the start of this pandemic, we have witnessed a pattern of alarming behavior from the Chinese government in a range of areas.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GETTY-stephanie-murphy-031820.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GETTY-stephanie-murphy-031820.jpg</url> Stephanie Murphy serves as one of the original co-sponsors of the bill to protect the U.S. from Chinese manipulation of coronavirus. Image via Getty. The bill requires the Director of National Intelligence   in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense, State and Homeland Security   to prepare an assessment within 90 days of enactment of the different ways in which the Chinese government has exploited or could exploit the pandemic. Murphy and her colleagues note COVID-19 originated in China and seek intelligence on how the Chinese sought to take advantage of the situation to advance China's interests and to undermine the interests of the United States, its allies, and the rules-based international order. The bill is sponsored by Oklahoma Democrat Kendra Horn with New York Democrat Max Rose joining Murphy as prime co-sponsor. All are members of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition[26], which has endorsed the bill. 'This bill would provide U.S. policymakers with an intelligence community assessment of the different ways the Chinese government may be seeking to exploit the pandemic,' Murphy, a Blue Dog Coalition co-chair, added. 'Armed with this information, we can hold the Chinese government accountable and protect American interests.' Also co-sponsoring the legislation is the delegation's other Blue Dog member, Rep. Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg. Restocking remdesivir This week, Crist led delegation Democrats in penning a letter[27] to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar underlining the urgency of the COVID-19 epidemic. The letter said that hospitalizations in Florida are 'trending precariously higher' and noted that the Florida Department of Health has informed pharmacies that it has temporarily exhausted its supply of remdesivir, a drug used by hospitals to shorten the duration of COVID-19.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/azar-alex.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/azar-alex.jpg</url> Charlie Crist is submitting a request to HHS Sec. Alex Azar to replenish Florida's supply of remdesivir. 'According to health professionals we are hearing from, people will die without replenished stock of treatment,' the letter reads. 'Recently, the State of Florida requested additional, emergency supplies of remdesivir from HHS, and we strongly urge you to expedite consideration of this request.' The letter also said that Florida is implementing a new distribution model for the drug that will go into effect July 13, and it called for Azar to provide specific details so Floridians can be confident that they will have access to treatment. 'A clear and transparent process is in the best interest of patients,' it said. 'With time of the essence, we appreciate your immediate consideration of these urgent matters.' The following day, a new supply of remdesivir arrived, prompting a word of thanks. 'Grateful to @CDCDirector[28] Redfield, @SeemaCMS[29], and Dr. Deborah Birx for swiftly answering FL Democratic delegation's call for an emergency distribution of lifesaving COVID-19 treatment remdesivir,' Crist tweeted. Doubling down on hope Rep. Kathy Castor is bringing federal aid to people who sorely need it. Castor announced Thursday that a Tampa-based organization   the Tampa Bay Academy of Hope   will receive a $4 million federal grant through the Department of Labor's Pathway Home[30] program. The grant is meant to assist in the transition of justice-oriented adults back to the workplace, and the Tampa Bay Academy of Hope[31] was one of 20 recipients nationwide. 'We are a community that says we are here to help you do better on your pathway ahead,' Castor said. 'The Tampa Bay Academy of Hope continues to expand and establish a track record of success thanks to our partnership and federal support that this year will provide a big boost in investment for its job skills development and support services offered for returning citizens.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/castor-Tom-WilliamsCQ-Roll-CallNewscom.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/castor-Tom-WilliamsCQ-Roll-CallNewscom.jpg</url> Kathy Castor is coming through with federal aid for people who need it most. Image via CQ/Roll Call.;; The Academy has received similar grants of $1.5 million over the course of the last five years, but it hopes to use the increased funding to more than double its footprint. The Tampa Bay Academy of Hope currently serves 188 citizens in Hillsborough County, and it believes it can reach 563 people if it moves into neighboring Pasco County. The Academy has worked directly with youth in schools or young adults in prisons, but during the pandemic, it has moved to online jobs training and live coaching to maintain its level of services. 'We offer support to grow all the way around, but sustainable employment is the ultimate goal,' said Titania Lamb, executive director of Tampa Bay Academy of Hope. Stopping pandemic pill-popping A spike in opioid deaths has Sarasota Republican Vern Buchanan pursuing new federal funding to face the issue. He sounded alarms when the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office reported 29 fatalities over the first six months of 2020; there were 13 over the same time span 2019. In Manatee, once Florida's epicenter for opioid deaths, fatalities also climbed from 46 in the first half of 2019 to 49 this year. 'The spike in drug overdoses in our region during the coronavirus pandemic is tragic and alarming,' Buchanan said. 'We have to get treatment to those in need both in Southwest Florida and across the country. As we continue to combat the coronavirus we need to make sure we are addressing other health impacts exacerbated by this pandemic.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-5.49.17-PM.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-5.49.17-PM.png</url> An increase in opioid deaths prompts Vern Buchanan to seek additional funding for the issue Buchanan's office said there seems to be a direct line to isolation and depression around COVID-19 isolation and a spike in drug abuse. Lockdowns have also resulted in many treatment centers in the region closing down or scaling back. As Congress debates another coronavirus relief bill, Buchanan said mental health funding must be part of the mix. Nationwide, overdoses have climbed each month of the pandemic   18% in March, 29% in April and 42% in May   according to the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program. 'The opioid crisis has destroyed too many families and lives,' he said. 'We cannot forget about this crisis even during the coronavirus pandemic.' So long, WHO? This week, Trump followed through on a promise when he announced he was beginning the process to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO)[32]. While the President has some support within his party, others disagreed with the move. The WHO has faced criticism for failing to provide clear and consistent advice and been accused of 'siding with China.' Sarasota Republican Greg Steube is among those supporting Trump's action for those reasons.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Steube.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Steube.jpg</url> Greg Steube says adios to the World Health Organization. 'The WHO prioritized the Communist Chinese government and failed to protect the world from this pandemic,' he tweeted[33] earlier this week. 'It is right for President Donald Trump to stop sending billions of American taxpayer dollars to this corrupt organization.' Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is making a mistake. 'Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,' Alexander said in a statement. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden pledged to reverse Trump's action if he wins in November. Skirting SCOTUS ruling Besides the Trump tax return cases, other highly-anticipated decisions emerged this week. In one case, the ruled religious-based employers objecting to providing contraceptive health coverage[34] through the Affordable Care Act, are now not required to do so. The 7-2 ruling in the case where the original plaintiffs were the Little Sisters of the Poor, upheld expansions by the Trump administration that added exemptions for other employers using 'moral beliefs.' The administration's rules brought about the suit that finally ended this week, much to the delight of most Republicans and the pro-life movement. Many Democrats in Congress were upset with the ruling, including some that seek to thwart Trump and skirt the court's ruling. Rep. Lois Frankel joined three of her colleagues to file the Protect Access to Birth Control Act[35] within minutes of the court decision. The legislation seeks the repeal of the Trump administration rules before they can take effect.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lois-frankel.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lois-frankel.jpg</url> Lois Frankel is looking to skirt a Supreme Court decision with legislation to protect access to birth control. 'We aren't going to sit back and allow this court, or this administration, to put the health and well-being of millions of Americans at risk,' the lawmakers said. 'We are going to continue to fight against these dangerous rules in any way we can.' Alito wrote the opinion[36] for the majority, which included the conservative bloc of four justices plus Roberts. Also concurring with the opinion were liberal justices Breyer and Kagan. Panama City Republican Neal Dunn was among those praising the ruling, calling it 'not just a win for religious liberty, but also for life.' Weston Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Democratic Rep. Al Lawson of Tallahassee strongly disagreed. Lawson said 'SCOTUS got it wrong[37],' while Wasserman Schultz had harsh words for the ruling and the plaintiffs. 'Allowing employers to opt-out of the ACA birth control mandate is not an expression of religious liberty, but an act of discrimination,' she tweeted[38]. 'Reproductive health is health care.' Withholding building funds The effort to force changes of military bases named after prominent confederates continues; this time through the use of financial disincentives. The latest effort calls for withholding military construction funds[39] from those installations that have failed to have at least begun a renaming process. Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the subcommittee overseeing military construction funding, said the proposed 2021 appropriations for construction, veterans affairs and related items include the demand for name changes as well as other key provisions. 'Our brave service members should not have to live and train on bases named for traitors to the cause of creating a more perfect union,' the Weston Democrat said. 'Betraying the United States is not an act that should be honored, and it's beyond time for change at those military bases that do that with their namesake.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz.jpg</url> Debbie Wasserman Schultz is continuing the push to rename military bases, by withholding construction funds. The bill also provides $250.9 billion in both discretionary and mandatory funding, an increase of $15.2 billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. Funding for veterans programs includes $10.3 billion in mental health care services, including $313 million in suicide prevention outreach; $1.9 billion for homeless assistance programs; $661 million for gender-specific care for women; and $504 million for opioid abuse prevention. Wasserman Schultz and her committee are in agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has also called for the bases to be renamed. 'Along with other Democrats and Republicans who favor these changes, I will use all the tools in our legislative toolbox to rectify these misguided historical monikers,' she added. Trump has pledged a veto of any legislation requiring base name changes. Wilson antagonist sentenced One year ago, a federal defense contractor threatened the life[40] through a telephone message of Miami Gardens Democrat Frederica Wilson over her sponsorship for a bill calling for vaccinating school children. This week, the perpetrator learned his fate[41]. Darryl Albert Varnum admitted to U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett that he was intoxicated when he phoned in the death threat last year and says that he is ashamed of the impulsive act. He described his actions to Bennett as 'the worst mistake of my life.' Bennett sentenced Varnum to six months of home detention and an additional two months of court supervision. The sentencing guidelines called for a maximum of six months in prison.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wilson-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wilson-1.jpg</url> A man who threatened Frederica Wilson last year over a vaccination bill admits he was intoxicated at the time and was sentenced to six months of home detention. 'It was just so vile and so scary,' Wilson said. 'I was petrified.' Varnum also apologized to Wilson during the sentencing, but she was not on the video conference to hear it. Wilson said she was unaware of the hearing until a reporter called her asking for comment. 'I'm just wondering why,' she said. 'That's a law that I am supposed to be notified.' This is not the first time that Wilson has had a run-in with menacing calls and social media messages. In 2017, there was a disagreement with Trump[42] after Wilson blasted him for what she described as an insensitive phone call to the widow of a soldier killed in Niger. That prompted numerous calls and correspondence to Wilson from angry Trump supporters. 'That was a very scary time for me also,' she said. ICE changes rules Another controversy involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) involving foreign students is now raging. A new rule[43] tells nonimmigrant foreign students at institutions conducting classes exclusively online in the fall that they will need to transfer or leave the country[44]. The Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP), run by ICE, has granted exemptions due to the COVID-19 virus. The program announced this week that with only limited exceptions, those exemptions will not be renewed and nonimmigrant foreign students must transfer to institutions conducting at least some classes on campus.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shalala.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shalala.jpg</url> Donna Shalala is blasting a Donald Trump administration rule that threatens foreign students with expulsion from the country. Image via Getty. 'This policy is xenophobic and outrageous,' tweeted[45] Coral Gables Democrat Donna Shalala. 'This policy will have a dire effect across the entire U.S. higher education system and all students   regardless of their immigration status   will suffer.' Those deciding to stay in contravention of the new rule could face serious consequences. In the order, SEVP said students could face 'immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.' On this day July 10, 2013   House Republicans are bucking Senate moderates and President George W. Bush over the Senate's immigration reform bill. President George W. Bush and Sen. Rubio, who co-sponsored the bill are on opposite sides of the GOP conservatives, who oppose 'amnesty' for those here illegally. Republicans say they do not trust President Barack Obama to secure the southern border should they agree to other measures dealing with legal and illegal immigration. Rubio has come under intraparty criticism for his role in developing the legislation. July 10, 2018   One day after Trump nominated D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, both sides were gearing up for what is expected to be an intense confirmation battle in the Senate. Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, a member of the Judiciary Committee who will hold the confirmation hearing, predicted a 'rough, tough, down-in-the-dirt, ear-pulling, nose-biting fight.' Kavanaugh is replacing the retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's so-called swing vote. Before his career on the bench, Kavanaugh served as a lawyer; among his clients were the family of Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez, who was eventually taken from those relatives by federal forces with guns drawn April 22, 2000, and returned to his father in Cuba.

The trip was organized and mostly paid for by the Global Antitrust Institute, a part of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Regulators spent the days in classes with the institute's staff, which included a senior federal judge and a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. The program was presented as continuing education for antitrust regulators -- a way to learn more about the economic underpinnings of competition law.</p><p>  But critics and past attendees of similar conferences run by the institute said the sessions were more about delivering a clear message to international officials that benefited the companies paying for the event: The best way to foster competition is to maintain a hands-off approach to antitrust law.</p><p>  The Global Antitrust Institute is bankrolled in large part by tech companies -- corporate donors like Google, Amazon and Qualcomm -- that are facing antitrust scrutiny from some of the regulators who attended its programs, according to hundreds of pages of emails and documents obtained through open records laws, interviews with four past conference participants, and observation of a conference last year in Huntington Beach.</p><p>  The documents included donation checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars from Google and Amazon, as well as a three-year, multimillion-dollar donation agreement from Qualcomm. Those checks were a key component of the institute's $2.1 million budget in the year that ended in June 2019.</p><p>  The emails illustrated how the institute's leaders, including Joshua Wright, who has longstanding ties to Google, have worked closely with tech companies to fend off antitrust criticism. And they showed how the institute cultivated and tapped relationships with top competition officials -- even, in an aggressive courtship, asking Brazil's top antitrust regulator to recruit the country's judges to attend its conferences with offers of business-class flights.</p><p>  ''This is not a significant expenditure for these companies. And the potential benefits, even making it moderately less likely to be on the losing end of an ambitious antitrust case is worth that price many times over,'' said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers University's law school.</p><p>  It's difficult to determine the impact of the institute. But in Brazil, a tribunal last year dismissed three separate investigations into Google, which controls 97 percent of the country's search traffic, for a lack of evidence.</p><p>  Regulatory scrutiny is, unquestionably, a global issue for tech companies. Until recently, Europe was the main threat of antitrust action. Google has lost three competition cases there since 2017. Amazon is now the target of an inquiry in Europe for abusing its dominance in online commerce to squeeze smaller rivals. Qualcomm has paid more than $1 billion in fines to Europe for its anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>  Now other countries are also starting to take a more aggressive approach. Australia and Brazil are investigating Google, while Amazon is also facing an antitrust probe in India.</p><p>  The companies are also facing investigations at home. After years of a hands-off approach to monopoly enforcement, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are under investigation from federal watchdogs, state attorneys general and Congress. The Justice Department is expected to bring a case against Google in the coming months in what would be one of the biggest antitrust actions in the United States since the 1990s.</p><p>  The chief executives of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will appear before lawmakers soon as part of a congressional antitrust investigation into their market powers.</p><p>  Mr. Wright, the institute's executive director, said its mission, curriculum and lectures were available online for the public to assess and that ''open-minded observers'' will see the quality of its instruction from legal academics and economists with experience enforcing antitrust laws and prosecuting cases.</p><p>  ''That combination of academic and practical experience is one reason enforcement agencies' officials from around the world consistently choose to send their staff to our programs,'' Mr. Wright said in a statement.</p><p>  Teaching Antitrust Restraint</p><p>  The long era of restraint in antitrust enforcement in the United States can be traced back, in part, to an ideology that tied economic analysis to legal cases. The view was that it's not enough for a company to dominate a market and crush competitors, there must be evidence of so-called consumer harm -- usually in the form of higher prices. That notion permeated through the American judicial system with the aid of economics seminars for federal judges funded by corporate donors.</p><p>  The Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges, which ran from 1976 to 1999, was organized by the Law and Economics Center -- now housed at George Mason University's law school. By 1990, about 40 percent of all sitting federal judges had attended one of these seminars, according to the program's director.</p><p>  Researchers found that judges who attended the seminars were more likely to approve mergers, rule against environmental protections and organized labor, and use economic language in rulings compared to judges who did not attend, according to an academic study looking at the effects of the program.</p><p>  The Global Antitrust Institute, which was established in 2014 as part of George Mason University's Law and Economics Center, has taken a page from the success of the federal judges program and adapted it for an international audience. It is also starting to offer an economics program for U.S. federal judges, with one scheduled for October in Napa, Calif.</p><p>  Mr. Wright said it had already trained more than 850 foreign judges and regulators. It has hosted a senior judge at Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, as well as the current and former superintendent of Brazil's top competition regulator as ''visiting scholars.''</p><p>  The institute does not disclose the source of its funding, but The New York Times obtained copies of the group's annual budgets and donation checks in document requests. It is funded almost entirely by companies and foundations affiliated with companies.</p><p>  Tech companies have been major backers of the institute for several years. In 2017, Google, for example, donated $200,000 to the group and it contributed an additional $300,000 in 2018.</p><p>  On its website, Google discloses a long list of organizations that receive money from its government affairs and public policy team. On that list is George Mason University's Law and Economics Center and the George Mason University Foundation, which is where donations to the Global Antitrust Institute are directed. Google does not mention the Global Antitrust Institute by name.</p><p>  ''We're committed to transparency about the academic organizations to whom we make grants. Such organizations aren't acting on our behalf, and we expect and require our grantees to disclose their funding,'' said Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman.</p><p>Amazon, whose dominant shopping site and cloud computing unit are the target of antitrust inquiries, has donated at least $225,000 to the group, according to copies of donation checks. Amazon also listed the George Mason University Foundation among ''trade associations, coalitions, nonprofits and social welfare organizations'' that received more than $10,000 in payments from the company. It did not mention the Global Antitrust Institute.</p><p>  In thanking Amazon last year, Mr. Wright told Pat Bajari, Amazon's chief economist and vice president, that its donation would support the institute's mission to provide competition enforcers and foreign judges with the ''economic foundation for rigorous antitrust analysis.''</p><p>  ''Like most large companies, we support a broad range of organizations doing research in areas connected to our business. That does not mean we always agree with their viewpoints or that we direct the work that they do,'' an Amazon spokesman, Jack Evans, said in a statement.</p><p>  Another company secretly committed to donating $2.9 million over three years until 2020. While the company's name was redacted in grant documents, one of the agreements directed questions about the donation to a manager who has worked at the chip maker Qualcomm for the last 14 years.</p><p>Qualcomm has spent years fighting regulators around the world and incurred billions of dollars of fines over accusations of anti-competitive practices.</p><p>  In 2017, after the F.T.C. filed an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm, Koren Wong-Ervin, a director at the institute at the time, emailed an executive at the company to express that a recent debate about the technology licensing terms at the heart of the case was one-sided and not favorable to Qualcomm.</p><p>  ''I'm considering a GAI panel on the hill to counter this one,'' Ms. Wong-Ervin wrote. The Qualcomm executive responded that she would appreciate that.</p><p>  Ms. Wong-Ervin, a former legal adviser to Mr. Wright at the F.T.C., left her position at the Global Antitrust Institute in September 2017 to become the director of antitrust policy and litigation at Qualcomm. Ms. Wong-Ervin, who left her position at Qualcomm this year, declined to comment. Clare Conley, a Qualcomm spokeswoman, also declined to comment.</p><p>  Though it's not clear how much, if any, impact the group's education programs have had on the decisions of international regulators or judges who attended, ''nobody would be paying for this stuff if they didn't think it had an effect,'' said Suresh Naidu, a professor of economics and public and international affairs at Columbia University and one of the authors of the academic study on the economics seminars for federal judges.</p><p>  Maintaining the Status Quo</p><p>  The theme of the Global Antitrust Institute's teaching is clear, said Marshall Steinbaum, an assistant professor at the University of Utah's economics department. He reviewed a reading list and curriculum of last year's conference in Huntington Beach and characterized the program as ''in line with the institute's long-term agenda of weakening antitrust laws.''</p><p>  Among the reading material is a paper by Hal Varian, who is now Google's chief economist and who argues that the usual economic hallmarks of monopoly power do not apply to tech companies because of the nature of digital products -- they're expensive to develop initially but can be resold again and again at little additional cost -- and therefore should not be used by antitrust enforcers to justify aggressive action.</p><p>  Tommaso Valletti, who served as the chief competition economist for the European Commission from 2016 to 2019, has attended one of the institute's events and knows the group's positions and teaching practices. He said the institute presented one-sided examples of competitive markets working correctly to reinforce the view that markets left on their own work well -- to the benefit of entrenched tech companies.</p><p>  ''They do not give a balanced perspective of economics and its application to antitrust,'' said Mr. Valletti, who now heads the economics and public policy department at Imperial College in London. ''They still portray a simplistic vision of markets, which I believe fits well their goals.''</p><p>  The Global Antitrust Institute's head, Mr. Wright, is a divisive figure within the world of antitrust law. He became the institute's executive director when he returned to George Mason University after serving as one of the five Federal Trade Commission members from 2013 to 2015.</p><p>  When Mr. Wright stepped down from the F.T.C., he joined Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati -- the law firm that represented Google in antitrust matters. He was a counselor at the firm until 2019 when he also served as the head of the antitrust institute.</p><p>  Mr. Wright is an advocate of the status quo in antitrust enforcement. As a contingent of economists and lawyers push for a new approach for dealing with monopolies in the face of Big Tech, Mr. Wright, who also has a doctorate in economics, has derisively designated the movement ''hipster antitrust'' in a 2018 paper.</p><p>  He is also known for his close ties to Google. During the F.T.C. nomination process in 2012, Mr. Wright was criticized for his paid work for the search giant and agreed to recuse himself from Google matters. Google had helped to fund several of his academic works including a 2011 paper: ''Google and the Limits of Antitrust: The Case Against the Case Against Google.''</p><p>  A week before he was sworn in, the agency announced that it had wrapped up an investigation into Google without taking any action. While he had not played a direct role in that decision, Mr. Wright's emails with Google reveal how closely they worked together.</p><p>  In a 2012 email, Adam Kovacevich, a former public policy director at Google, asked Mr. Wright whether he planned to attend an event in which Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah and vocal critic of Google, would be speaking. At the time, Mr. Lee seemed to be toning down his criticism of the company.</p><p>  Mr. Kovacevich, who left Google in 2019, suggested that it ''might be worth lobbing a question about his comments about Google.'' Mr. Wright replied ''Cool... absolutely. Heh - maybe get one of my antitrust students to ask.''</p><p>  Mr. Wright also worked closely with Google to deflect media criticism of the company. When a CNN reporter asked Mr. Wright in an email whether Google favoring its own content in search results violated antitrust laws, he defended the company in a lengthy reply. He forwarded his response to Google and added ''Just FYI.'' Mr. Kovacevich responded: ''Thanks, I encouraged him to get in touch.''</p><p>  In a 2011 email, Mr. Wright asked a legal assistant at Google about an outstanding invoice. When she said it had already paid $125,000, Mr. Wright said there should be ''another one or two.''</p><p>  A Brazilian Budget Squeeze</p><p>  The gap between the deep pockets of the institute's corporate donors and the overseas regulatory agencies is especially stark in a country like Brazil, where the annual budget for Brazil's antitrust regulator is about $15 million.</p><p>  Brazil's competition authority, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, better known as CADE, is clear about its financial constraints. So when the institute invited CADE officials to attend a conference in 2016, Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo, the agency's general superintendent, who oversees its antitrust investigations, said that they were eager to participate, but that it would be difficult to afford sending staff.</p><p>  ''I must let you know, however, that we are facing severe budgetary restraints and unless the expenses are covered, we cannot unfortunately assure we will be able to send a representative,'' said Mr. Cordeiro.</p><p>  The institute offered to pay for up to six CADE officials to attend the conference in Washington. Since then, other CADE staff have attended institute conferences in Oahu, Santa Monica and Tokyo. In each case, the institute has covered travel, hotel, transportation and most meals -- even allowing some officials to spend an extra night at a resort to recover from jet lag.</p><p>  Since 2015, 27 CADE officials have attended the group's conferences, according to the agency. Last year, the institute paid for 10 Brazilian judges to fly business class to attend a conference at a Four Seasons hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Mr. Cordeiro was also a visiting scholar at the institute, spending two months there in 2017.</p><p>  It's created a close working relationship. When CADE received an invitation for the Huntington Beach conference, the agency could barely contain its excitement.</p><p>  ''I just want to let you know that among all the other training opportunities that we offer along the year, the one from GAI is without a doubt the most appealing to our staff,'' wrote a CADE official in an April 2019 email.</p><p>  CADE has allowed the institute to handpick attendees. After 24 agency candidates applied for the six spots at the 2016 conference in Washington, the institute selected the six candidates it wanted. A year later, for a conference in Dubai, G.A.I. selected from a pool of eight CADE candidates for two attendees and two wait-list spots.</p><p>  When the institute was trying to recruit Brazilian judges for a conference in Lisbon last year, Douglas Ginsburg, who is a senior judge with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington and chairman of the institute's board of advisers, appealed to Mr. Cordeiro.</p><p>  ''It would be particularly good if you could recruit judges,'' Judge Ginsburg wrote in February. He added that a secretary for one judge had asked about whether the institute would pay for business class flights for others. A few days later, Mr. Cordeiro responded by saying he had recruited seven judges.</p><p>  In a written statement, Mr. Cordeiro said he was an academic as well as a public servant so it ''is natural to be consulted about possible parties interested to take part in debates of this nature'' and that there is nothing wrong with recommending ''other public authorities for a renowned international academic conference.'' He said the institute has paid for his flights and accommodations in the past, but he has never received any other form of financial support.</p><p>  Judge Ginsburg did not respond to emails seeking comment or a phone call.</p><p>  Separately, CADE said it was not aware of the institute's corporate donors and noted that its officials do not participate in training sponsored ''directly'' by private companies.</p><p>  ''CADE has strict rules regarding the performance of its employees and that participation in events of any nature does not influence the work carried out within the scope of the municipality,'' the agency wrote.</p><p>  In addition to the three separate investigations into Google dismissed by the tribunal last year, there are two open investigations into Google's handling of Android, its smartphone software, and Google's use of third-party content in Google News and Google Shopping.</p><p>  Elizabeth Farina, a former president of CADE from 2004 to 2008, said there needed to be transparency about the source of the money and accountability for the staff who take part. When asked whether she would have let her staff attend conferences like the ones offered by the Global Antitrust Institute, Ms. Farina, who is now the chief executive of a consultancy, said no.</p><p>  ''In general, I don't think it's a good idea,'' she said.</p><p>  Leticia Casado contributed reporting in Bras\u00edlia.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: The Global Antitrust Institute is a part of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.

Two big Competition and Markets Authority decisions of the past week \u2014 first to wave through <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ee743b2-02ba-4996-9716-b34e2e676282\">Amazon\u2019s investment in Deliveroo</url> and then       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d193cd4-9108-4e28-be60-3f309b2ef5d5\">Takeaway.com\u2019s takeover of Just Eat</url>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 have CMA chair and ex-MP Andrew Tyrie\u2019s fingerprints all over them. </p><p>Both were controversial cases for the trust buster to take on. Under previous iterations of the competition watchdog, the deals would probably never have been called in. </p><p>The CMA\u2019s recently-found desire to be the biggest, baddest regulator in the fightback against the dominance and spread of big tech was no doubt the main reason why Deliveroo\u2019s funding round got stuck in a year-long regulatory review process. The grounds for blocking it looked flimsy. Would Amazon, which stopped delivering takeaways in 2018, have a sudden change of heart if its deal with Deliveroo was blocked and launch a fierce new competitor? Could Deliveroo, with its sideline in corner shop grocery deliveries, constitute a potential competitor to Amazon Fresh? Really?</p><p>But once the CMA had made that case for calling in Deliveroo, it was hard-pressed to waive through the Just Eat takeover, a same-sector deal where the acquirer, Takeaway.com, had also recently quit the market. </p><p>Covid-19 gets the CMA off the hook. Phew. It would be a bold but deaf regulator that made trouble for the businesses that have enabled restaurants to keep cooking and home-cooks in lockdown to take a night off. Easy to get dewy-eyed and dub them essential to keeping the home fires burning. By giving the Deliveroo deal the (provisional) green light on the grounds that it would fold if not, the watchdog avoided being spatchcocked on the merits of its arguments. And once Deliveroo\u2019s deal was through, it was hard to hold out on Takeaway\u2019s Just Eat tie-up. </p><p>In clearing both, the CMA proves to the government that it will not make political problems over points of principle. That does not mean there are not problems with the Deliveroo decision fudge, though. </p><p>The CMA has previously been loath to approve deals on the grounds of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c296d9e-e654-486a-9e40-f8f39ea191e0\"> \u201cfailing firm\u201d defence used by Deliveroo</url>. Plenty of companies laid low by Covid-19 will argue that if Deliveroo clears that hurdle, they should be allowed to tie-up with rivals too. The CMA can\u2019t let them win that argument and keep its tough guy image. The watchdog must balance its political heart with its legal brain if it is to be credible and consistent. Here, the heart has ruled the head.</p><p>De Beers draws warmth from Anglo</p><p>The diamond industry is on ice, from beginning to middle to end. The market for diamonds \u2014 also known as \u201cice\u201d because their dazzle is cold and they draw heat from warm objects \u2014 has been hit hard by coronavirus. De Beers, which with Alrosa of Russia unearths more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s sparklers, has certainly drawn heat from its owner, Anglo American. On Thursday, it lowered production guidance for the year by a fifth.</p><p>Last month De Beers canned its regular sale of diamonds in Botswana because buyers from Israel, India and China could not travel. It is unlikely travel will unfreeze in time for the next auction in a month or so.</p><p>The market is suffering from top to bottom. Consumers and merchants from Antwerp to China are in lockdown or emerging from it. So too are the cutters in India, who buff up about 90 per cent of all mined gems. Most producers, whether in Southern Africa or Canada, have been forced to put mines on care and maintenance. The longer the lockdowns last, the harder and more expensive it will be for them to ramp production back up. </p><p>The market was already fragile. Supply has been abundant.

We're all just trying to figure out the right way forward.\"</p><p>Lowe noted there are existing examples of what can happen, in lieu of statutory limitations, when it comes to how new technology is deployed and where those tools sometimes intersect with and breach the boundaries of personal privacy rights.</p><p>Last year it was revealed that Utah authorities had allowed facial recognition technology to be used without judicial warrants to conduct dragnet scans of a driver's license database that holds the photos of some 2.5 million residents, including minors.</p><p>An attempt to codify some restrictions on the use of facial recognition tools in Utah had a hearing before a legislative interim committee last November, but came up short as both lawmakers and local civil rights advocates deemed the effort didn't go far enough to protect Utahns.</p><p>Connor Boyack, president of Utah-based libertarian public advocacy group Libertas Institute, said the failure of both the follow-up effort on facial recognition in the 2020 general session, as well as the run at new DNA database protections, were due at least in part to resistance from law enforcement agencies. He also expressed his optimism that the issues would be revisited.</p><p>\"Privacy-focused bills this session faced significant though unsurprising pushback from law enforcement agencies who resisted any restraint being imposed on their ability to use new technologies to fight crime,\" Boyack said. \"We are disappointed in the short-term setback but very confident that these proposals will be refined throughout the year and that privacy protections will soon be in place to keep an Orwellian Utah government in check.\"</p><p>Widely reported technology failures in the Iowa Democratic primary caucus in February presented further evidence to one Utah lawmaker that the state should move slowly and deliberately toward any future change to a statewide online voting system.</p><p>To that end, Rep. Mike Mc- Kell, R-Spanish Fork, sponsored a proposal to spend some 20 months on a study to determine what, if any, digital voting system is secure enough to trust with running Utah elections.</p><p>That proposal,\u00a0HB292, got unanimous support from a House committee and strong bipartisan support from the full body but failed to make it out of the Senate Rules Committee for further consideration.</p><p>A bill aiming to create new rules for unaccompanied minors catching rides in autonomous vehicles for hire ran into a similar fate.</p><p>The proposal, HB414, from House Minority Caucus Manager Karen Kwan, D-Murray, would have required a parental waiver to allow Utah children ages 8-16 to jump into an automated Uber or Lyft without an adult as well as stipulate rules about fastening seat belts, having video documentation of the ride and required an onboard emergency communication system. No such service is yet available in Utah.</p><p>After running into issues in an initial committee hearing, Kwan made tweaks that earned the proposal unanimous committee approval and an overwhelmingly supportive floor vote, but moved no further.</p><p>One bright spot among tech-focused proposals was passage of new rules to allow for autonomous delivery robots on Utah's sidewalks and roadways.</p><p>Fruit Heights Republican Rep. Stewart Barlow's proposal,\u00a0HB277, establishes some base rules for use of delivery robots, including allowing for operation on sidewalks and at the edges of roadways, limiting speeds to 10 mph in areas shared by pedestrians and 20 mph on roads, and requiring operators to carry a minimum of $100,000 in liability insurance should autonomous operations experience a glitch.</p><p>Numerous companies are developing the vehicles, which are typically battery-powered and feature onboard sensor technology like video cameras, radar and Lidar (a laser-based detection system) coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence software to operate without human intervention.\u00a0</p><p>The new personal delivery vehicle rules follow other recent rule changes adopted by legislators that have helped open doors for the use of emerging autonomous vehicle technology. Utah lawmakers have previously signed off on\u00a0new allowances for test operations of autonomous passenger vehicles\u00a0as well as the testing of\u00a0software that coordinates platooning of freight trucks.</p><p>Barlow's proposal establishes statewide rules for delivery bots but also allows for local governments to adopt their own rules, letting them \"reasonably regulate the operation of personal delivery devices on a highway or pedestrian area,\" according to the bill language.</p><p>email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-49592566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF2-X051-JBRG-X1XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 15, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjYyRTk3QUVFRjk4NDVGMkI0REI0NDA4NTUzRDY5NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk0RkJCOUQ5NEFCNDE2N0EzRUE0QzU2RUFBOEEzRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Evidence</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>DNA</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDY1M0RBQ0NBMDNGNDU3NUFEMjVDQUQ1NUI5NzUyM0Y7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0RBNTc0MjA0QTAwNERDNEJGQjhCQkIxMjVGNzQ3NDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000520</classCode><className>DNA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000184</classCode><className>BIOMETRICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

We're not talking small change: The payments totaled $4.3 billion between 2003 and 2006.</p><p>That's actually not what landed Dell in hot water. Instead, Dell was charged with defrauding its investors by pretending that those payments were operating income. The maneuver artificially inflated Dell's balance sheet and helped it beat Wall Street's earnings estimates for four years.</p><p>But Intel's naughty behavior continues to be the subject of a separate Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigation, parts of which were used in the SEC's case against Dell. That probe appears to be nearing an end: The FTC this week extended its deadline to settle with Intelover a years-long antitrust suit. The deadline, which was scheduled for Thursday, was extended for two weeks as the FTC considers Intel's proposed settlement deal.</p><p>Intelhas already been slapped with penalties for using its dominant market position to bully chip customers into exclusively buying its products. The European Union conducted its own Intelprobe that culminated in a record $1.45 billion fine, levied in May 2009. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is also investigating Intelfor antitrust violations.</p><p>In November, Intelinked an peace treaty with AMD. The world's largest chipmaker paid its rival $1.25 billion and agreed to abide by \"a set of business practice provisions.\" In return, AMD dropped all three of its pending lawsuits against Intel.</p><p>\"[Intel] doesn't have an obligation to help us; they do have an obligation not to do things that are intended to hurt us,\" Dirk Meyer, AMD's chief executive, said when the settlement was announced.</p><p>Dell's hidden kickbacks</p><p>For Dell, the money train really took off in 2003, when Intelsharply increased its payola. The SEC noted that the rise coincided with AMD's April 2003 release of its new Opteron processor -- which many analysts believed to be technologically superior to Intel's competing Xeon processor.</p><p>According to the EU investigation's findings, Dell wasn't the only computer maker that Intelpaid to stay away from AMD. Intelalso gave rebates or direct payments to Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Acer, and NEC.</p><p>What made Dell's case stand out is how the computer maker reported that income to its investors. Dell never disclosed that it was receiving those payments, and when Intel's incentives stopped coming in May 2006, Dell's quarterly operating profit dropped by 36%. Three-quarters of that decline was directly attributable to the disappearance of Intel's payments, according to the SEC.</p><p>But Dell lied to investors, telling them that the severe drop was due to the company \"pricing too aggressively on slowing demand\" and to component costs falling less than expected, the SEC said.</p><p>The deception went straight to the top. Dell founder Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins were each fined $4 million for acting complictly in the fraud. The SEC also fined several other high-ranking executives. Among them, only Michael Dell remains with the company in a top position.</p><p>When the government first began investigating Dell in August 2005, Dell hired outside investigators to conduct an internal review of the company's accounting activities. That probe lasted a year and involved nearly 400 lawyers and forensic accountants examining 5 million documents. In the end, they concluded that Dell's financial controls were weak and that senior executives had manipulated accounts to meet quarterly performance targets.</p><p>In January 2007, while the internal investigation was still ongoing, Rollins was forced out and replaced by Mr. Dell, who had been serving as chairman of the board at the time. Dell adjusted its financial results from between 2003 and the first fiscal quarter of 2007.</p><p>Dell's $100 million settlement gets it off the hook with the SEC. Despite the SEC's finding that Michael Dell was involved in the fraud, the company's board continues to stand behind him and said he will retain his position as CEO.</p><p>But Dell has other legal battles ahead. Unrelated to the Intelpayments, a Web hosting company called Advanced Internet Technologies has sued Dell for selling faulty computers that the computer company allegedly knew would fail. The case is set to go to trial in October.</p><p>Other big tech companies are also in the government's crosshairs.</p><p>The FTC is reportedly looking into Apple for blocking Google's ad network from its iPhone applications. Google is facing its own Department of Justice investigation -- the DOJ is determining whether Google's settlement with authors and publishers over Google Books went too far. That deal allows Google to sell digital copies of out-of-print books that are still copyrighted.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous antitrust suit against a tech company was the U.S. government's decade-long crusade against Microsoft.</p><p>The government came close to breaking the company up, but eventually settled in 2001 for a much less drastic set of changes that included ongoing monitoring by a regulatory watchdog. The European Union took a harsher stance, and in 2008 fined Microsoft $1.2 billion for pricing out rivals and refusing to comply with the terms of the court's previous antitrust decision.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20100723dell_intel1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:8011-0S20-Y927-F1G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><timeReceived>4:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>July 23, 2010 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

Some dont want to put all their data and applications into the hands of a single public cloud providers in case something goes wrong with the service, some want to run particular workloads on the cloud infrastructure that runs them best, or some dont want to put their test/dev or production environments on the same cloud. Many organizations can point to applications they would rather keep behind their firewalls.</p><p>Whatever the reason, organizations are definitely adopting a multicloud strategy, which given their disparate needs and the emerging workloads that involve artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data analytics, virtual and augmented reality or any other number of modern technologies, makes sense. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others are making it easier for businesses to leverage their clouds and run such compute-intensive workloads. Now tech vendors are working to find ways to make it easier for organizations to move their workloads between public clouds and between public clouds and on-premises environments. Containers and Kubernetes have helped ease the challenges, but more needs to be done.</p><p>According to Dell EMC, an important step is creating an operating environment that is consistent across public and private clouds, noting the growing trend among enterprises to move workloads and data from one environment to another.</p><p>Were seeing a large shift of applications that were born in the cloud starting to be repatriated back, Sam Grocott, senior vice president of marketing for Dell EMC Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), said during an online press conference before the kickoff to VMworld 2018 this week in Las Vegas. Customers really need to plan not only for a multicloud world but a world where workloads are going to be dynamic, going on- and off-prem seamlessly and change over time.</p><p>Enterprises need a consistent operating model that includes not only hardware and software but also services, whether its accelerating the development and certification of products faster and the ability to test with a multiple cloud provider before you deploy your application. And then there are regulatory requirements and data sovereignty requirements. The most important benefit of having a consistent operating environment is that theyre able to evaluate the application that is right for each cloud and them move it back and forth without having to change the operating environment.</p><p>When Dell bought storage giant EMC (and therefore most of VMware) nearly three years ago for $67 billion, the vision by Michael Dell and others with the vendor was of a massive company that was able to leverage the myriad businesses under the same umbrella to give customers more complete offerings in a wide range of areas, including the cloud. Dell EMC has followed that path, combining its compute, storage and networking offerings with technologies from other Dell Technologies companies like Virtustream and Pivotal to build out a cloud platform strategy that stretches from the public cloud into core datacenters.</p><p>In the same vein at VMworld show this week, Dell EMC is tightening it relationship with VMware to roll out a range of new and enhanced cloud offerings. On the infrastructure and platform front, including the VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solutions that were developed in conjunction with VMware. The solution will now support new releases of VMware software within 30 days of their announcement and VMware Validated Designs (VVD) for VxRail include offerings for stretched clusters and multi-site deployments. In addition, Dell EMC is unveiling its Network Fabric Design Center to enable customers to optimize the networking in their hyperconverged infrastructure solutions.</p><p>Dell EMC is introducing a new VxRail solution, the VxRail G560, a 2U offering that includes 1.75 times the number of processing cores than its predecessors, with two times the processing power and four times the memory.</p><p>The companys VxRack SDDC (software-defined datacenter), a pre-integrated HCI offering based on Intel-based PowerEdge servers, is designed to help customers quickly set up a VMware Cloud Foundation environment, will more closely align with VxRail options, including the storage-dense S Series.</p><p>Dell EMC is now making its Cloud Snapshot Manager backup and recovery product for public clouds available on Azure to go along with VMware and AWS, and is bulking up the latest version of its Data Domain Virtual Edition with support for the KVM hypervisor along with VMware and Hyper-V and expanded capacity from 60 TB to 96 TB. Regarding the CloudIQ product for monitoring and addressing the health of storage products, Dell EMC is now expanding support for five Dell EMC storage platforms, including PowerMax, VMax and ExtremeIO, more tightly integrating the product with VMware offerings and offering a mobile app for Apple and Android smartphone users.</p><p>The company is looking to expand the reach of its Elastic Cloud Storage object storage offering into the midsize enterprise market by enabling customers to start as small as 60 TB, about an 80 percent reduction in storage capacity from what is offered now, according to Grocott.</p><p>Dell EMC is in a highly competitive environment when it comes to support for multicloud deployments, but according to Grocott, the alignment of Dell EMC with other Dell Technologies company is an asset.</p><p>We have a unified view across VMware, Dell and the other members of the Dell Technologies family where were really looking at and studying when [customers] move to multicloud, he said. The multicloud is on various dimensions. Its obvious that not all of their eggs are going to be in one basket. It can be in an on-prem cloud, it can be in a service provider cloud, it can be in a public cloud; its typically not going to be in one. It also speaks to the multiple types of clouds that were going to see customers deploy, so there isnt just one way to do multiple clouds from an infrastructure standpoint or from an application standpoint. Thats why were really looking at VMware and Pivotal to deliver [products] that can be turnkey and integrated and appliances that can have that connective tissue into those multiple clouds. Or there some that really like to build their own and leverage their own infrastructure and enable that to speak to multiple clouds without having that be a turnkey appliance. The key differentiator we see going forward above all that is that consistent operating model experience. Thats where we can differentiate us from any of the competition out there. Its a connected experience, so that the learning curve is near zero. 2018 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-124586644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4T-GG91-JDJN-617Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1192\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001V67</classCode><className>EMC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009U17</classCode><className>VMWARE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DLV5</classCode><className>HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC3572 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC3571 ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC3663 RADIO &amp;

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Wednesday, May 20th. Your top stories right now, it is 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America is getting back to business today. Today, all 50 states are seeing at least a partial reopening this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, the search for a vaccine continues. Moderna is under pressure this morning after a report surfaced yesterday questioning the data on its vaccine from earlier this week. The stock this morning is down 5.5 percent. We will speak with the CEO of Moderna this morning live. Stephane Bancel will join me in 30 minutes time to answer critics and give us the very latest on the road ahead for its potential vaccine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retail back in the spotlight this morning. Two companies that have remained opened during this pandemic reporting quarterly earnings this mornings.</p><p>Lowe's soaring pre-market after seeing same store sales rise significantly and an 80 percent jump in online purchases. Lowe's shares are up 7 percent right now.</p><p>Target also had a double beat on earnings and revenue, reporting a digital comp sale soar 141 percent. Profits were down, though, as coronavirus costs offset the gains from the boost in sales. Target shares are up about half a percent.</p><p>Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a rally at the start of trading. The Dow futures up 277 points right now, better than 1 percent. The S&amp;P 500 up 32 points and the Nasdaq higher by almost 100, better than 1 percent there as well.</p><p>This after concerns over the Moderna vaccine trial led to a late day selloff yesterday. In fact, at 4:00 on Wall Street, the market was down across the board. Dow Industrials gave up 390 points. The Nasdaq down 49, and the S&amp;P down 30 points. This market is reacting to any news on vaccines.</p><p>Delta Air Lines adding flights as the country reopens this morning. Coming up in just moments from now, Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, is here. Find out when he expects to see domestic and international travel bounce back and what measures he's been taking to keep passengers safe.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning have a firmer tone. Searching for some direction in Europe, though. The FT 100 is up 7.5 points, the CAC quarante is negative. It's down 18 points in Paris. And the DAX index in Germany is up by 31 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher overnight. China holding its benchmark lending rate unchanged, leaving its one year loan prime rate at 3.85 percent. There is a lot of expectation that we will see a lot more stimulus coming out of China.</p><p>Travel amid coronavirus. Airlines one of the industries hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, but some airlines saying that the worst could be over, this week reporting slower ticket cancellations and an uptick in bookings on some routes. Analysts have said that air travel will be slow in returning back to normal, of course, and that flights will likely remain below 75 percent capacity into next year.</p><p>Joining me right now in this exclusive interview this morning is the CEO of Delta Airlines, Ed Bastian.</p><p>And, Ed, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>ED BASTIAN, CEO, DELTA AIR LINES: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How would you characterize where we are right now, Ed? Do you feel like you've seen the worst at this point or it's hard to know?</p><p>BASTIAN: I do think we've seen the worst. Mid-April, while everyone was under stay at home orders and international restrictions were up in terms of travel for every country around the world, we really were at the bottom. We were down to probably about 5 percent of our revenue base that was still traveling primarily in the U.S. You compare that to today, we're up to 10 percent. So the optimistic me says we've doubled in the last four to six weeks as we've started to reopen our economy, still very much on the domestic side as compared to international. But, still, we've got a long ways to go. We were at about 90 percent down on a year over year basis, but making slow and steady improvements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, liquidity has been such an important story for you in terms of being able to raise what you have.</p><p>Yesterday on the program I spoke with the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, Steve Wynn was here, and he was really zeroing in on the airlines and how important it is to have that traffic.</p><p>Here's what he said about the first steps in terms of reopening the Las Vegas Strip. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Summer quickly approaching, travelers are going to be eager to jump in the resort pools. They're going to want to go to the casinos. They're going to want to go to the restaurants. What are the plans right now?</p><p>STEVE WYNN, FORMER CEO, WYNN RESORTS: For Las Vegas, the first hurdle is the airlines. They -- we've got to make sure that the service that has supported those 160,000 rooms on The Strip, that the airport is up-to- speed, otherwise people will only be able to drive from California. So assuming that we get lift from the airlines.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is so important, Ed, because the airlines are really the answer, the solution for so many other industries, obviously Vegas and the hospital industry.</p><p>What routes are you planning in terms of -- are you expecting more business? What do you have to say about what he said in terms of the airlines?</p><p>BASTIAN: Well, I agree with what Steve said, we need to get our economy reopened. One of the challenges we have in the airline space is that no one flies on an airplane just to fly on an airplane. They need to have some place to go. So they need to have the resorts open, the casinos open, the hotels, the restaurants. People need to know what to expect when they get to their destination.</p><p>What I'm hearing from travelers constantly that -- particularly those that are out traveling, and we still have, you know, a meaningful number of people who are traveling, is that they are very impressed with our cleaning standards, with the quality of service that we're providing. They don't have some place to go when they get there so they need to understand what's -- what's going to be on the other side of their trip. They need businesses to be reopened. They need those casinos to be in place.</p><p>So we're working as a travel ecosystem. I spoke last week, in fact, at the U.S. Travel Association board meeting about that very case, and we're all in this together, as we all said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've said that you want to keep planes no more than 60 percent full to promote social distancing. New reports that the company will add more flights to keep up with that demand and you could resume service on some routes.</p><p>What can you tell us about that and about your cash burn right now, Ed? The analysts, of course, are talking about the liquidity position and you seem to be having the -- the -- enough liquidity, but where are you in terms of that and your -- and how much money the company burns?</p><p>BASTIAN: Our team has done a great job of reducing cost. When your revenues are down as low as they are, you really need to focus on getting your costs out of the system. For the current quarter that we're in, our second quarter, our costs are going to down in total more than 50 percent on a year over year basis. That's over $5 billion for Delta. We've done a great job of raising capital through the private markets. We expect to end the June quarter, June 30th, with a cash balance of about $14 billion.</p><p>So we're prepared for a long, difficult winter ahead. There's no question. It's going to be very slow in coming back. But over the next 12 to 18 months I'm confident travel is going to return and we're going to see our economy opened up primarily because of the mobility that we're going to enable through the airline industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean the president -- when I spoke with the president last week in that exclusive interview said that, look, we're not sure about international travel, but people will start moving within the country fairly soon. Certainly he was expecting that.</p><p>What do you say about international travel, Ed? Is that sort of the last thing that you might expect to reopen at this point? Is that a 2021 affair, do you think?</p><p>BASTIAN: I think international travel largely is a 2021. We do operate continued routes, you know, into Europe, into Asia, into Latin America where we can. Primarily, though, we're flying because of cargo. You know, we're bringing medical supplies in. We're bringing essential supplies back to the country. But we are starting to take customers on those trips as well.</p><p>I'd say the one market that we're seeing the most success on is Korea and we are going to be instituting starting next month a seven day service to Seoul in China. I think the Koreans have done an excellent job of giving us a peek as to what the future looks like in our industry.</p><p>On the domestic side, it's still continued slow, but, you know, we're making good progress. Today our load factor on Delta is somewhere around 35 to 40 percent full, primarily because we've taken many flights out of the system, but we're still operating 1,000.</p><p>I was on a plane yesterday. My plane was 50 percent full. And what I said is that once we get close to 60 percent on an individual route, that's -- that will be the trigger for us to add more planes into the system. So, for the month of June, we're adding about 200 flights into the system and then in July probably another 200 to 300.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That -- that is just terrific. I love to hear that. That really makes you feel like we're -- we're slowly but surely getting back there.</p><p>How do the planes look at this point, Ed? What should we expect? What can travelers expect when they get on-board? Is the middle seat empty? Or how are you doing social distancing? What about the crew, are they wearing masks? Tell us a little about that, the practical situation.</p><p>BASTIAN: Well, I welcome you onboard one of our planes again soon, Maria, so you can see for yourself, but the planes are in great shape. The 60 percent load factor cap is enabling customers to create as much space as they can. It's a very different experience than, you know, what people were accustomed to historically. All of our crew are wearing masks. We require our customers to require masks, to wear those masks. We've got electric spraying going on in front of every single flight we take. We spray down the interiors.</p><p>One of the things that people aren't aware of is that quality of our filtration systems on-board our planes. We use high quality, HEPA filters, which is the industry standard across all industry, where we recirculate the air, the entire air in the cabin, every two to four minutes. It's the same filtration systems used in hospital operating rooms. And we bring fresh air into the cabin. Over 50 percent of the airflow that comes into the cabin is fresh in every two to four minutes and it's proven to eliminate over 99.999 percent of what viruses or anything -- any particles in the air.</p><p>So it's a very clean experience. Customers that speak to me and talk to me say we're really impressed with what you're doing in terms of the quality of the experience, but we need some place to go. We need businesses to start to reopen so those business travelers have a client to go and visit (ph). We need the theme parks and the casinos to start to open slowly, as Disney is starting to and made some announcements this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BASTIAN: So we're kind of walking our business back and we're going to need to walk through the entire travel system together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So a stark prediction from Boeing. The CEO, David Calhoun, speaking out, saying that he sees the Covid-19 pandemic leading to a major U.S. air carrier going out of business. The prediction was criticized by many airline industry leaders. Delta recently announced that it would be retiring its fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft.</p><p>Your reaction to Calhoun's prediction? We know that it's a tough period out there with traffic down 90 plus percent, Ed.</p><p>BASTIAN: I don't see that happening in the U.S. You know, internationally, we are seeing some airlines going out of business. But in the U.S., I give primary credit to the president, the administration, leaders on The Hill. They were able to pass the CARES Act and within the airline industry we had the payroll support program. So, as an industry, we received $25 billion to keep our employees in place for the next six months through the end of September 30th.</p><p>And the reason we wanted to do that is we needed to see what the other side of this pandemic looked like before we took any drastic actions with respect to eliminating jobs or dramatically impairing our ability to respond when the economy's ready to reopen. So our government, there's no government in the world that's been as responsive, I'm proud to say, and it's kept all of the major airlines in business.</p><p>It's going to be a tough sled (ph). I think in the -- over the next couple of years you may see different restructuring activities occurring. But, no, I don't -- I don't agree with Dave's assessment at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, you're right in terms of the comment, but, you know, when you hear it from the CEO of Boeing, who's a major -- you know, the major supplier, you sit up and listen.</p><p>In terms of the government, those warrants to acquire give the Treasury roughly 1 percent of Delta shares through warrants, obviously. Have you heard from government officials in terms of how you might, you know, operate the business differently? Are they having an opinion in terms of how you allocate capital, et cetera? Because, you know, when we had Steven Mnuchin on the other day he said the airlines, we're looking at them as national security.</p><p>BASTIAN: Yes. You know, Secretary Mnuchin's been a -- been a good friend to the industry. I've spent a lot of time getting to know him well over the last couple of months.</p><p>But, no, the government's intent all along has been to be a passive investor, primarily to make certain that the taxpayers are receiving some value back for the important investment they made in keeping our employees in place.</p><p>The $25 billion didn't as much go to the airlines, it was going directly to keep our employees, to pay the payroll of our employees for the next six months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a tough period out there in all industries and they want to make sure employees are not feeling stressed.</p><p>You're keeping the crews safe. What kind of expense is this for you, Ed? I mean Delta's requiring face masks for customers and flight attendant, but one airline going one step further. Have you seen what Qatar Airways is doing, Ed? Flight attendants are going to be wearing disposable hazmat suits on flights to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>Would you consider having your crew wear these hazmat suits, Ed, or is this one step beyond?</p><p>BASTIAN: I think that's a step beyond, Maria. You know, we want our customers to feel safe. Candidly, I think the -- if our crews are wearing hazmat suits, it would scare our customers. They'd wonder why they're not wearing hazmat suits in return.</p><p>Our cabins are incredibly clean. There's been no documented evidence of Covid spreading anywhere on an airplane. You know, with all the distance requirements, the space we're providing, the extra cleaning, the cabin environment is incredibly clean and sanitized and the filtration systems are working.</p><p>So, as I said, the customers that are traveling are rating us very, very high on cleanliness and what the real challenge they're facing is they don't have some place to go and travel to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BASTIAN: They all want to travel. People miss travel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BASTIAN: People miss interacting and the human spirit. I -- you know, I'm glad that we can do this through electronic means to talk to you this morning, but I'd much rather be sitting in the studio with you having that conversation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Me too. Same here, Ed.</p><p>BASTIAN: So we're going to get back out there. We're going to continue to re-inspire confidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. We are rooting you on, Ed. Thank you so much.</p><p>Ed Bastia is the CEO of Delta Airlines.</p><p>We've got the CEO of Moderna right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New questions for the Obama administration this morning about who knew what and when. A new portion of former National Security Adviser Susan Rice's declassified e-mail was revealed yesterday. Rice writes this, from a national security perspective, Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information. President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn. Rice says, Comey replied, potentially.</p><p>Joseph Pinion, she sent this e-mail to herself on Inauguration Day. Your reaction to the fact that we're just reading about this now. Shouldn't this have been one of the e-mails that -- at one of the portions of the e-mails reviewed a long time ago, that it's potentially exculpatory evidence, isn't it?</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I mean, look, this is just another line of -- another instance of a long line of obfuscation by the Obama administration. I mean I know Democrats like to pretend that the worst thing Barack Obama ever did was wear a tan suit into the Oval Office. I assure you, there was much worse.</p><p>And so, I mean, these are the same people that lied about fast and the furious, they covered up Benghazi. I mean Susan Rice herself with that infamous meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac of the airport.</p><p>So, again, you -- every iteration we have here is more and more evidence of an administration that was complicit in trying to thwart the efforts of Donald J. Trump to become president of the United States. And if you continue that, to see the malfeasance that occurred at the FBI, from an FBI attorney literally -- basically cooking up false evidence, to use that as the basis to get a FISA warrant, to now the alleged frame job here we have of Michael Flynn, every time we look at these issues, it's more Democrats behaving badly than pretending that there's nothing to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a lot of entrapment going on.</p><p>We will learn more when John Durham comes out with the results of his criminal investigation in the next couple of months.</p><p>Coming up, FaceBook's capacity. The social media giant's new office rules. Wait till you see what they're telling employees. We're taking a look when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson will stop selling talcum baby powder in the United States and Canada. This after declining demand, as well as thousands of lawsuits over its safety, including some very expensive jury verdicts.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Judge, this has been going on a long time with regard to the Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder and the debate about its safety. Tell us about it.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: You know, baby powder is really J &amp; J's legacy product, which they've been manufacturing and selling in the United States continuously since 1894. So they faced a humongous number of lawsuits alleging that the talc in the powder caused cancer. And, guess what, the overwhelming majority of juries found that it did not. But those that found that it did cause cancer hit J &amp; J so heavily to the tune of $5 billion that it just decided to throw up its hands, and after 130 years of selling this product in the U.S., is not going to do it -- and Canada, is not going to do it any longer.</p><p>It appears that they are selling a newer product that has a different absorbent in it other than talc and it appears that they may be selling their product in other countries that are not as litigious as here.</p><p>But the point I want to make is, J &amp; J was terrified by a few verdicts here, even though the overwhelming majority of jurors and juries sided with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, that's amazing to me. The fact that the overwhelming result would have been a positive for them, but just the threat of anybody else coming in and saying, no, no, no, that's not -- and I'm going to sue you has them stopping the sale of it. And something that was their legacy product. It's a pretty big story.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. Correct. It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I don't know what their thinking was. I believe that they're self-insured. $5 billion is going to hit anybody hard, no matter how wealthy you are. But their lawyers actually did a good job. They only lost a handful of cases and won the overwhelming majority.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>All right, Judge, thanks very much.</p><p>Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us.</p><p>We'll talk more about that, Judge. It's great to see you today. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Coming up, the CEO of Moderna is here. Stephane Bancel joins me to answer critics on the vaccine trial results from earlier this week. We will take a look at the prospects for a vaccine coming up from Moderna.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, May 20th. Your top stories right now just before 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are pointing to a rally at the start of trading this morning. Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the start of trading of 247 points on the Dow, better than 1 percent. The Nasdaq is up 90 points and the S&amp;P was up -- is up this morning about 30 points.</p><p>This after concerns yesterday over Moderna's vaccine data. That led to a late day selloff for the broader averages. As you see, the Dow Industrials at the close yesterday was down 390 points. Moderna also traded lower and the company's CEO is going to be joining me in a moment to talk about the potential vaccine from Moderna.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are searching for some firm direction this morning. We've got the FT 100 up 9.25 points, but the CAC quarante in Paris is down 25 and the DAX index in Germany is up 13.5.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher. China holding its benchmark lending rate unchanged, leaving its one year loan prime rate at 3.85 percent. We are expecting further stimulus coming out of China.</p><p>Two big technology companies reportedly announcing some major changes when employees return to work.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Going to be hearing a lot of this, I think, Maria.</p><p>Good morning again.</p><p>\"Bloomberg\" says the number of FaceBook employees are going to be capped at 25 percent when they are allowed back into the office in early July. Employees will also have their temperatures checked, work on multiple shifts and wear face masks when they are not social distancing.</p><p>Google will also limit capacity. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet, telling a tech podcast, capacity is going to be between 20 and 30 percent by the end of 2020. A separate report says that workers who need to return to the office can start next month.</p><p>Toy maker Mattel expanding its new line of toys honoring workers on the front lines of Covid-19. The Thank You Heroes collection now includes Uno cards, building sets and Match box cars. The collectibles adding to the heroes action figures, but that features medical workers and delivery drivers. All proceeds are going to go to help those affected by the virus. There is a year-to-date chart of Mattel. A little bit of pressure on that chart over the last year.</p><p>And here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Belmont Stakes set for June 20th without fans and it will lead off the Triple Crown series.</p><p>YouTube pursues TV advertisers with new program. YouTube Select is going to let brands by ads through the smart TV app and they're trying to retain basically ad revenue. Companies have been slashing budgets.</p><p>And this one, tourists and high end shoppers slowly returning to Rodeo Drive. The famous street, Maria, has opened for curbside pickup for now.</p><p>And those are your headlines.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, curbside pickup on Rodeo Drive.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Got to love it.</p><p>Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are zeroing in on a vaccine this morning of Moderna's race for a vaccine is now raising some questions. Scientists are saying Moderna did not disclose sufficient critical data to assessing its Covid-19 vaccine. The biotech company reporting very positive results earlier this week from an early human trial which showed that people given its potential vaccine generated antibodies to this virus.</p><p>And joining me right now to talk more about all of this is the CEO of Moderna, Stephane Bancel.</p><p>And, Stephane, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>STEPHANE BANCEL, CEO, MODERNA: Good morning. Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I know that you've invested so much in this over the last 10 years, so I'm going to get to that. But let's talk about first the most recent concerns and two vaccine experts interviewed by Stat News report that the company has yet to publish your studies in scientific journals, they also pointed out that the company disclosed results from only eight of the 45 participants, meaning that the majority of outcomes remain unknown.</p><p>What can you tell us?</p><p>BANCEL: Yes. So we, on Monday morning, shared interim positive phase one data. So as the press released (INAUDIBLE) it's interim (ph) data. It want basically, Maria, a cut (ph) of the data as of Thursday.</p><p>I want to remind that these studies being run by NIAID, the division of the NIH, that is led by Dr. Anthony Fauci. And they run the study. And they analyzed all of blood samples.</p><p>What we showed indeed is that the low dose and middle dose, we have all (INAUDIBLE) up to that data cut of last Thursday that showed antibody at or above the level of convalescent serum. And we shared that of the first eight of those, we had neutralizing antibodies, meaning antibodies that will bind and neutralize the virus. We have only eight of those because it takes a much longer time to analyze the neutralization assay (ph). And that was the data we had as of Thursday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stephane, will you be publishing in scientific journals this information on the first human trial?</p><p>BANCEL: Yes, obviously. And one of our reasons that we only shared top-line data and not the full data set is to preserve the ability very soon for NIAID to be able to publish the data in a peer-reviewed medical journal. And that's what they intend to do and that is what we have also done as a company in the past. So we're not changing our policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is an important point that you make because another concern that was talked about yesterday was that the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has not said anything about this information, even though it was partnering with Moderna. But, yesterday, the vice president tweeted this out. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted this out on Monday saying, in our call with governors today, Dr. Fauci shared exciting news from biotech company Moderna. The first potential coronavirus vaccine has shown promising results in a clinical trial. Forty-five participants received two doses of the vaccine and all 45 produced antibodies.</p><p>So you did get the weigh-in from Dr. Fauci, although that was one of the concerns that we hadn't heard from him yesterday.</p><p>BANCEL: Yes, indeed. We were happy to see that tweet on the Internet. Again, I go back to what I said before, which is, those are interim data. They are early, obviously. It's a small data set. All the things we said on Monday, that is in the press release. But they are encouraging data. This is what Dr. Fauci seems to have said at the governors meeting. Obviously, I was not there. And that's why we are encouraged and we are moving as fast as we can.</p><p>We know there's a lot of suffering. People are dying. For the last four months, our teams, partnering with the NIH, and working hand in hand with the FDA, they've been remarkable in terms of their quick response. We have been able to go from the sequence of a virus to interim phase one data. The FDA has given us a few days ago now the green light to go into phase two. And we are in final planning to start a phase three with thousands of subjects as early as July.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I think this is why you had the buy-in from Fauci and from the government early because the scale that Moderna has built up in the last 10 years, getting the IP in place, using software, using hardware, I want to talk about your technology, that the government can come to you and say, well, we need a billion doses and we need you to manufacture this because you worked with them for the last 10 years.</p><p>Can you talk to us a little about the investment that you've put into this before these headlines of the last week? Over a 10-year period.</p><p>BANCEL: Of course. So the company is -- is nine years old. We have invested literally billions of dollars from investors to build the science correctly. We've published extensively over the years. We've partnered with Merck four times. We've partnered with AstraZeneca three times. We also partnered with the Department of Defense, with (INAUDIBLE), with the Gates Foundation and so we've partnered for a Zika vaccine that is in the clinic. We shared (INAUDIBLE) positive interim phase one data that's also very encouraging on the Zika product. And with Dr. Fauci's team, we've been working for almost two years now on a different kind of viruses and vaccines. And the reason we are able to move so fast with them is that one of the vaccine we have worked together again is the MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, that, as you might recall, happened in the Middle East a few years ago. And it was also a coronavirus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BANCEL: And so all that work we have been doing with the NIAID division of Dr. Fauci was very helpful because we could just, on the sequence, (INAUDIBLE) sequence of a virus once published online by the Chinese authorities. We could use that information to design very quickly a vaccine and we not only reported those interim, positive phase one data, we also reported on Monday that we showed in an animal model full protection where basically you vaccinate the animal and then you give them a high dose of a virus and in that learned we could demonstrate we had very, very reduced level of virus in their lungs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>So then what do you think of this latest stat report then?</p><p>BANCEL: I just think that, again, they said things that we said the same thing, which is why it is quite surprising. We say on Monday this is an interim phase one study and it was a small number of subjects. Neutralizing antibody, eight subjects. It's in our subtitle of our press release. They say that the data was not published. As we said, this is top-line data. It will be published very soon. We're talking weeks, not months. And they say that they reached out to NIAID and that no comment. Again, I don't know who they tried to talk to -- to NIAID. The only thing I know is what the vice president has tweeted about the comments that seems --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>BANCEL: That Dr. Fauci made to the governors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a very -- very good point. You don't know who they spoke to. We've already heard from the vice president.</p><p>Stephane, tell me your level of confidence on phase two and phase three.</p><p>BANCEL: So we have a platform. We've have a vaccine. This is not our first vaccine. This is our tenth vaccine in clinical studies. We have, as I said, partnered with BARDA on Zika. So we've -- the government. We have partnered with Merck on the (INAUDIBLE) respiratory virus called RSV, for which there is no vaccine approved today. And so we have those very close now to 2,000 healthy people with our different vaccines around the world.</p><p>The FDA has seen all our data over the years. And we believe that our platform has this very interesting feature that (INAUDIBLE), which is basically a genetic molecule that we inject in human's arm, like a typical vaccine, and your body is going to read the instructions we give you to make one protein of a virus to educate your immune system.</p><p>And what is very interesting about our technology, we -- it makes us cautiously optimistic about the phase two and the phase three but we want to be cautious because it's science and it's complicated.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BANCEL: But I am cautiously optimistic because of all the data I have seen over the last four years, in all of those vaccines, and you see a very small variation between different humans that get the vaccine. And that's very encouraging as we go from thousands of peoples, the past two is going to be 600 subjects, and the phase three, where we have not finalized the total size with the FDA, is going to be many thousands of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it sounds like you're optimistic about phase two. You did a - - you did a big money raise this week, more than $1 billion, $1.5 billion or so. How will that money be used and tell us about your R&amp;D. You've got other things in the pipeline that you've been working on. How do you allocate the capital from the money raised this week and what -- how does that impact the other drugs in the pipeline right now, Stephane?</p><p>BANCEL: Yes. So the money we raised this week, as we said in our S-4 that we filed with the SEC, is to be used to build the manufacturing capacity to be ready if the vaccine gets approved, which, of course, we are hoping for because of all the suffering that's happening around the world.</p><p>What we're trying (INAUDIBLE), Maria, is the following. If we wait to invest in manufacturing capacity when we have potentially and hopefully FDA approval for a vaccine, we will not be ready to supply the United States or other countries with a vaccine that would have been approved, and that would be, of course, awful from a public health standpoint. And so what we are doing with this capital that was raised Monday night is we're going to buy new equipment, we're going to buy raw materials, we're going to hire more employees that we have to train because it's, as you know, very regulated industry. We have to be very careful and follow protocols so that we make the products correctly to ensure safety of people that will eventually potentially get this vaccine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stephane, let me ask you about your manufacturing capability because you've got the Norwood facility in Boston, which is a beautiful facility. A lot of technology there. I want to ask you about robotics and what you've done in terms of software and technology to move this forward. But also I want to get your take on outside of the United States. We know that you've got the manufacturing capability in the United States. What about ex-U.S.? Are you going to build that on yourself? Are you going to take on a partner for ex-U.S.?</p><p>BANCEL: Yes, so indeed, in (INAUDIBLE) sense, we have build the state of the art facility that is fully integrated, meaning we make cure (ph) materials, we make (INAUDIBLE), we put lipid, i.e. cholesterol and fat are on the (INAUDIBLE) to deliver it once you get injected. And we put it in vials. It's a fully integrated plant, fully digital. You know, in the industry (ph) you need to do batch recall where everything is highly documented to ensure quality and safety of a product. And this is done using computers actually to remove human mistakes. And that's for the U.S.</p><p>This facility, as we've said in the past, is able to roughly produce at full capacity with process scale-up and going 24/7 around 100 million dose. If you assume a 50 microgram dose for this vaccine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BANCEL: So that's a lot of those (INAUDIBLE) for most vaccines. But in the case of a global pandemic, it is obviously not enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BANCEL: So what we announced two weeks ago is a very strategic long-term partnership with Lonza (ph), one of the biggest and largest Swiss companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BANCEL: And they are allowing us through their infrastructure and their factories to potentially build manufacturing capacity to deliver up to 1 billion doses, again, at the 50 microgram dose.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is amazing. A billion doses, amazing.</p><p>Real quick, do you think you'll have a vaccine by year-end, Stephane? I know you've got the phase two trial in July. Year-end vaccine or next year?</p><p>BANCEL: So phase two is going to start any day. We got the green light from the FDA. Phase three will start in July. It is possible, assuming the best case scenario, and there are many risks that could derail us, obviously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BANCEL: But we could potentially be in a position to file to the FDA toward the end of the year or early next year. Again, this is best case scenario.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that is the music to our ears.</p><p>Stephane Bancel, thank you so much for joining me this morning. We'll be watching the developments.</p><p>Great to see you, sir.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, contact tracing is considered key to stopping the spread of coronavirus, but states are launching contact tracing apps to help keep residents safe. They're having a tough time.</p><p>Joining me right now is the cyber guy, Kurt Knutsson, to explain why.</p><p>And, Kurt, this dovetails into a privacy conversation, doesn't it?</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY: Man, it sure does.</p><p>Good morning, Maria.</p><p>You know, of all the tools in the contact tracer's arsenal to help identify and prevent the spread of Covid-19 infections, technology has got the most potential. Well, that's if tech gets it right. All you have to do is ask any health official actively involved in preventing further spread.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. SARAH VAN ORMAN, CHIEF HEALTH OFFICER, USC: The usefulness of the contact tracing app is what's happening is as people move about their day, all the time information is being stored and they're actually connecting to other people who might have the contact tracing app. If that person then goes into the app and says, hey, I have Covid, it will then be able to pull up that information and send an anonymous message to those people that may have had contact with that phone during the infectious period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KNUTSSON: And here's the deal, Maria. You know, it sounds simple enough, but this is not what USC's head of health, Dr. Sarah van Orman, nor the rest of the country is really seeing with this. In fact, we're seeing a lot of glitches instead. The biggest of which is a big tech trouble of Bluetooth accuracy in the location. Sometimes the phone might be three feet, six feet, it can't really tell if it's 10 feet away from another phone so that accuracy is questionable. Then comes the idea that there are reports out there that already people who have this enabled come very close to one another and it never registers the phones. There's a lot to work out there.</p><p>Number two is the fact that people simply are not interested in the states that have this of downloading this app. So that's the second problem. And maybe it's because of the privacy issues. If you take a look at the states first with contact tracing apps, really the state that pops out here, you've got Rhode Island, South Dakota, North Dakota and Utah. And Utah asking, if you look at their app and download, it's called Healthy Together. Well, good try at this, but, man, it's knocking on privacy door here. They want your name, e-mail address.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know. Yes.</p><p>KNUTSSON: They want complete access to your contacts in your phone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KNUTSSON: And location, Bluetooth data and it goes on and on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>KNUTSSON: But don't say good-bye to it yet. We're just at the beginning of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Kurt, we'll be watching. A lot of things to discuss there.</p><p>Kurt Knutsson.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Time for \"The Morning Buzz.\"</p><p>First up, the hundred million dollar podcast. Joe Rogan inking an exclusive and expensive deal with Spotify to air his show by the end of the year.</p><p>Dagen, you're a loyal listener here. You're the first one that brought up Joe Rogan on this program. Are you going to use Spotify now or are you going to need to subscribe?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: No, I have Spotify's app. And the show will continue to be free on Spotify. So it will still be on other platforms starting September the 1st when it begins airing on Spotify. By the end of the year, it will be exclusive to Spotify, including full video versions of the show.</p><p>I suspect this deal is worth more than $100 million. It feels like when Howard Stern moved to satellite radio. But more and more I get phone calls from friends and even relatives asking me, I don't get this Joe Rogan podcast. It's disorganized and rambling and it just -- they don't get to the point and I -- I don't have three hours of my day. And I said, well, you need to maybe smoke some weed so you're on the same wave length.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the Elon musk podcast certainly introduced Joe Rogan to a lot of people who were not following it before that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That -- yes, Elon Musk</p><p>MCDOWELL: It -- so Musk has been on more than once. And sometimes he gets a really good guest, but sometimes it's just like two bros just shooting the you know what and just rambling and it's not funny, it's not really anything. So sometimes I listen to it. Sometimes not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, good for Joe Rogan to get a deal with Spotify.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's take a break.</p><p>When we come back, we are talking politics and business with former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. He is here live.</p><p>Also, how would you like to be the CEO of a company with the hottest product on the market. The CEO of Clorox is here, Benno Dorer, on United Airlines clean plus initiative and those Clorox wipes, all next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020052002cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY9-S531-JB20-G0WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6977\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 20, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

The DOJ indicated they would 'be on high alert for collusive practices,' particularly with respect to the sale of these products to governmental entities.1The DOJ warning follows in the footsteps of increased regulatory scrutiny over technology companies and online platforms in recent months. Big tech firms face active investigations from multiple government agencies\u2014and the regulators are looking at the past, as well as at the present.2 The Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') even established a task force aimed specifically at anticompetitive conduct in technology and online platform markets,3 but has yet to issue any real guidance in the space. </p><p>Congress is also in on the action, with Senators urging regulators to act. As recently as March 10, 2020, the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee heard testimony from Yelp about its concerns that Google favors its own products in searches to customers' detriment. A lot has changed since the FTC concluded its 2013 investigation of whether Google's search results ranking practices were biased in favor of its own content with no finding of misconduct.4Consumers and regulators alike are directing unprecedented attention to technology firms and online shopping platforms.While the major focus appears to be on the four major big tech firms at the moment, attention is likely to spread as consumers turn to other retailers to stock up. All companies that sell products in great demand at the moment due to COVID-19\u2014regardless of their size and market power\u2014would be well-advised to take a look at their pricing algorithms (especially any price optimization tools), supply chains, and any information sharing mechanisms to ensure that they are antitrust compliant. Counsel should familiarize themselves with the various inputs of any pricing algorithms to ensure each is supported by a legitimate business purpose and confirm what, if any, information related to pricing is shared outside of the company. It may be a good time to remind employees of antitrust do's and don'ts as companies struggle to keep up with demand and price products appropriately during this unique and stressful time.--- 1 The full press release is available here[1]. 2 TC to Examine Past Acquisitions by Large Technology Companies (February 11, 2020)[2]; Justice Department Reviewing the Practices of Market-Leading Online Platforms (July 23, 2019)[3]. 3 FTC's Bureau of Competition Launces Task Force to Monitor Technology Markets (February 26, 2019)[4]. 4 Statement of the Federal Trade Commission Regarding Google's Search Practices, In the Matter of Google Inc., FTC File Number 111-0163 (January 3, 2013)[5].

With only six months left of the current legislative session, and after a year of work on their bipartisan investigation, the Subcommittee must act quickly to ensure that the investigation -- and any subsequent reports -- can be written with full consideration given to all relevant materials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The groups argue that Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple have significant power over the country's commerce, discourse, and communities -- power that is likely to increase over the course of the pandemic. To allow these corporations to refuse to hand over critical documents or have their leaders ignore calls to answer questions from the nation's elected legislative body would be to cement the perception -- and perhaps even the reality -- that these corporations operate outside of the jurisdiction of Congress and regulators, and outside the rule of law.</p><p>\"We applaud the Subcommittee for the measures they've taken to this point to uncover critical information about how these dominant platforms impact our economy and democracy,\" said Sarah Miller and David Segal, Co-Chairs of Freedom From Facebook &amp; Google. \"But as the investigations progress, the unwillingness of these corporations to be forthcoming, and misleading testimony by an Amazon employee before the Subcommittee, warrant a heightened degree of seriousness and speed. Congress needs to know how these corporations operate so that it can legislate, and that won't happen without timely action from the Subcommittee.\"</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos has already demonstrated his contempt for elected officials by dismissing their direct requests and sending his subordinates to mislead Congress on his behalf. As the richest man in the world, Bezos might think he is above any accountability. His arrogance is in a league of its own, but it's representative of an industry whose executives believe themselves to be above scrutiny from the American public. It's up to the House Judiciary Committee to prove them wrong. Rather than holding our breath and hoping that Bezos finally discovers his sense of public duty, the Committee should finish what they started and use their subpoena power to compel Bezos to testify,\" said Maurice BP-Weeks, Co-Executive Director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, an Athena member group.</p><p>* * *</p><p>To: The Honorable David Cicilline, Chairman, House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, U.S. House of Representatives</p><p>The Honorable Jerrold Nadler, Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, U.S. House of Representatives</p><p>The Honorable F.

Your oversight hearings and any subsequent report will be critical tools for understanding how, where, and whether to act to protect Americans from monopolies in the digital age.</p><p>We encourage you to use all necessary tools - including subpoenas if necessary - to compel the production of vital information from these large and important institutions. Moreover, we believe that the CEOs and decision-makers of these corporations should testify and participate in this vital fact-finding mission, and that you should use any necessary measure to secure their cooperation.</p><p>The Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law is the heir to a great tradition of oversight over questions of corporate control. Chairman Emanuel Celler used it in a series of hearings in the 1950s and 1960s to understand problems across our economy, in everything from the production of war material to the supply of newsprint.</p><p>Your investigations into the technology sector are part of this tradition, and we applaud the work that you have done so far and the bipartisan manner in which you have done it.

Le pr\u00e9sident de l'Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des communications \u00e9lectroniques et des postes (Arcep), connu pour sa d\u00e9fense acharn\u00e9e de la concurrence dans le secteur des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, est une voix \u00ab\u00a0qui compte\u00a0\u00bb lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9battre des cons\u00e9quences de l'irruption du num\u00e9rique dans la vie des citoyens. Critique des positions monopolistiques des Gafam, d\u00e9fricheur de sujets encore peu audibles - \u00e0 l'image de la neutralit\u00e9 des plateformes -, S\u00e9bastien Soriano fut l'un des invit\u00e9s du <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legrandbarouf.fr /\">Grand Barouf num\u00e9rique</url>, organis\u00e9 \u00e0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/lille\">Lille</url>les\u00a020\u00a0et\u00a021\u00a0mars derniers. </p><p>Convi\u00e9 \u00e0 disserter sur \u00ab\u00a0Comment gouverner \u00e0 l'heure des Gafam\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb, il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 nos questions \u00e0 la suite d'un d\u00e9bat qui l'aura notamment vu ferrailler avec Benjamin Bayart, cofondateur de la Quadrature du Net et partisan d'une stricte r\u00e9gulation des Gafam par l'autorit\u00e9 politique.  Le Point\u00a0: Dans un discours prononc\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment lors du festival South by Southwest, vous avez tenu des propos critiques \u00e0 l'encontre des grandes plateformes, et mis en avant des solutions pr\u00e9cises - \u00e0 l'image d'un d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement dit \u00ab\u00a0doux\u00a0\u00bb des Gafam. En parall\u00e8le, vous avez insist\u00e9 sur le r\u00f4le des individus et des communaut\u00e9s plus que sur celui de la puissance publique dans la r\u00e9gulation de ces m\u00eames Gafam. Est-ce un aveu de modestie, de faiblesse\u00a0?   S\u00e9bastien Soriano\u00a0: Je pense qu'il est temps de sortir de l'opposition binaire entre \u00ab\u00a0laissons faire le march\u00e9 autor\u00e9gulateur\u00a0\u00bb, et \u00ab\u00a0c'est l'\u00c9tat qui d\u00e9cide\u00a0\u00bb. J'insiste l\u00e0-dessus\u00a0: aujourd'hui, nous avons un probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9tat d'esprit, \u00e0 la fois chez le l\u00e9gislateur et chez le r\u00e9gulateur. On raisonne dans une logique de l'ancien monde, avec une vision du pouvoir r\u00e9sidant soit dans les mains des entreprises, soit de l'\u00c9tat. Il faut casser cette opposition. Les solutions apport\u00e9es par l'\u00c9tat doivent donner plus de pouvoir et de responsabilit\u00e9s aux communaut\u00e9s et aux individus. L'important est d'inciter ces derniers \u00e0 se structurer afin de peser sur le devenir du num\u00e9rique.  Mais les citoyens peuvent-ils peser face \u00e0 la puissance \u00e9conomique et politique des grandes plateformes\u00a0?   Aujourd'hui, l'asym\u00e9trie est effectivement forte entre, d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 des multinationales aux leviers financiers colossaux, et de l'autre l'individu. Ces plateformes ont une capacit\u00e9 d'action et de contr\u00f4le qui d\u00e9passe sans doute tout ce qui a pu exister dans l'histoire de l'humanit\u00e9. La Compagnie britannique des Indes orientales ne contr\u00f4lait pas autant de sph\u00e8res de la vie des individus \u00e0 son \u00e9poque. Ce d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre est d'autant plus marqu\u00e9 que le principal ressort d'ajustement sur lequel nous avions pari\u00e9, qui est la concurrence, ne fonctionne plus.  Pourquoi cela\u00a0?   Car dans notre esprit, nous vivons encore \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du paradigme schump\u00e9t\u00e9rien. J'y ai personnellement contribu\u00e9 lorsque je travaillais \u00e0 l'Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence il y a une dizaine d'ann\u00e9es, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des premiers avis rendus sur <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/google\">Google</url>. L'un d'eux pr\u00e9conisait de ne pas r\u00e9guler Google, car l'entreprise finirait par \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e par un autre service - \u00e0 l'image de ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/myspace\">MySpace</url>et <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/yahoo\">Yahoo</url>. Nous pensions encore que la th\u00e9orie des cycles d'innovation s'appliquait, que l'acteur majeur allait \u00eatre balay\u00e9. Dix ans apr\u00e8s, force est de constater que cela n'arrive pas, notamment \u00e0 cause de ce que l'on appelle la\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0loi de Metcalfe\u00a0\u00bb, li\u00e9e aux effets de r\u00e9seau.  Pouvez-vous nous expliquer ce que sont ces effets de r\u00e9seau\u00a0?   Ces effets de r\u00e9seau ont \u00e0 voir avec la protection dont vous disposez lorsque le nombre d'utilisateurs de votre service cro\u00eet. Cette accumulation d'utilisateurs vous permet d'\u00eatre plus efficace, plus attractif. Un exemple\u00a0classique\u00a0: lorsque tous vos amis et proches s'inscrivent \u00e0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/facebook\">Facebook</url>, vous allez en faire de m\u00eame. Ces effets peuvent d\u00e9jouer les m\u00e9canismes classiques de concurrence.  Il faut bien comprendre que la concurrence est un m\u00e9canisme autocorrectif fabuleux\u00a0: c'est la crainte de celle-ci qui pousse les acteurs \u00e9conomiques \u00e0 proposer des services de qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 un prix modeste, et \u00e0 investir de mani\u00e8re forte. En tant que r\u00e9gulateur des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, je mesure tous les jours la puissance de cet instrument, qui nous a permis de baisser les prix et de favoriser l'investissement en France. La concurrence est un instrument qui discipline les grandes firmes. Lorsqu'on la perd, c'est l'\u00e9difice qui s'\u00e9croule. Le discours sur la \u00ab\u00a0main invisible\u00a0\u00bb du march\u00e9 s'effondre.  Dans l'histoire, des lois anti-trust ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vot\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es lorsque la concurrence \u00e9tait fauss\u00e9e par des entreprises monopolistiques, \u00e0 l'image de la Standard Oil. Nous trouvons-nous dans une situation similaire aujourd'hui\u00a0? Est-ce \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 politique d'entrer dans la m\u00eal\u00e9e\u00a0?  Absolument, car les outils de r\u00e9gulation dont nous disposons aujourd'hui sont dat\u00e9s. Le droit de la concurrence a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit au sein d'une \u00e9conomie fordiste, dans le cadre d'une expansion mondiale pilot\u00e9e par l'Occident. Il a permis \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie europ\u00e9enne d'\u00eatre comp\u00e9titive \u00e0 l'export, et aux m\u00e9nages de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de prix attractifs. Le monde dans lequel nous rentrons - Pierre Veltz, dans un ouvrage assez lumineux, le nomme La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 hyper-industrielle - se caract\u00e9rise par des m\u00e9caniques de concentration dans diff\u00e9rents p\u00f4les mondiaux - concentration des talents, des donn\u00e9es, des brevets, des centres de recherches, des capacit\u00e9s industrielles. Dans ce fonctionnement-l\u00e0, nous ne pouvons plus raisonner avec des m\u00e9canismes de droit de la concurrence classiques.  Dans la doctrine \u00e9conomique contemporaine, inspir\u00e9e par la pens\u00e9e de l'\u00e9cole de Chicago, le primat est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'on appelle \u00ab\u00a0le surplus du consommateur\u00a0\u00bb, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 court terme, qui s'appr\u00e9cie par la faiblesse des prix. Probl\u00e8me\u00a0: aujourd'hui, les Big Tech proposent des services bien souvent gratuits\u00a0! Si l'on suit un raisonnement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation actuelle du droit de la concurrence, on devrait dire\u00a0:\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0C'est bien, c'est gratuit, on n'y touche pas.\u00a0\u00bb C'est une limite forte de la doctrine actuelle, et il est plus que jamais n\u00e9cessaire de l'amender. Cela peut se faire de plusieurs mani\u00e8res, non exclusives\u00a0: d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, une r\u00e9flexion th\u00e9orique, en lien avec des travaux universitaires. De l'autre, via la mise en place de nouveaux m\u00e9canismes l\u00e9gaux, qui permettront aux autorit\u00e9s d'\u00eatre proactives.  Aujourd'hui, au niveau europ\u00e9en, nous en sommes quand m\u00eame \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me proc\u00e9dure contre Google. Les standards de preuve sont extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9s, et les sujets envisag\u00e9s par le petit bout de la lorgnette. Cela nous emp\u00eache de structurer le march\u00e9. Je d\u00e9fends une r\u00e9gulation europ\u00e9enne pr\u00e9ventive permettant de fixer des r\u00e8gles du jeu sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 destination de quelques plateformes gigantesques, et qui ne concernerait pas l'ensemble des acteurs \u00e9conomiques - contrairement au R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es (RGPD), par exemple.  Quelle forme prendrait cette r\u00e9gulation\u00a0? Faut-il suivre les conseils de certains \u00e9conomistes, dont Jean Tirole, qui d\u00e9fendent un contr\u00f4le tr\u00e8s strict des acquisitions d'entreprises par ces grandes plateformes\u00a0?   Absolument. Ce dont vous parlez, c'est la probl\u00e9matique des\u00a0killer acquisitions. Il arrive que des acteurs majeurs de l'\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique rach\u00e8tent des start-up car celles-ci les menacent. Le rachat d'Instagram par Facebook, c'est \u00e7a - Facebook a eu peur de devenir le MySpace de l'affaire. Aujourd'hui, nous n'arrivons pas \u00e0 r\u00e9guler de tels rachats \u00e0 cause d'un probl\u00e8me de seuil. Le contr\u00f4le des fusions-acquisitions s'applique \u00e0 tout entreprise\u00a0: du boucher du coin jusqu'\u00e0 Google. Pour \u00e9viter les charges d\u00e9mesur\u00e9es, les acquisitions s'effectuant en dessous d'un certain chiffre d'affaires ne sont pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9es. Et dans certains cas, le chiffre d'affaires de start-up naissantes est tr\u00e8s faible\u00a0!  Face \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat de fait, deux opportunit\u00e9s s'offrent \u00e0 nous. Un\u00a0: changer les r\u00e8gles du jeu pour tout le monde. Le probl\u00e8me est que vous cr\u00e9ez une charge administrative sur toute l'\u00e9conomie. De plus, vous g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisez une incertitude juridique si le contr\u00f4le s'effectue ex post, apr\u00e8s l'acquisition. Ma proposition est donc de viser uniquement les \u00ab\u00a0plateformes structurantes\u00a0\u00bb, peu nombreuses, auxquelles on appliquerait des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9cifiques, notamment un contr\u00f4le des concentrations afin d'\u00e9viter les killer acquisitions. Il s'agirait d'appliquer la recommandation de Jean Tirole, qui est de renverser la charge de la preuve en pr\u00e9sumant que tout achat de start-up par une Big Tech est anticoncurrentiel sauf si celle-ci arrive \u00e0 prouver le contraire.  Alors que certains d\u00e9cideurs politiques europ\u00e9ens d\u00e9fendent une taxe Gafam \u00e0 la port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'Atlantique <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/monde/le-journal-de-trump/etats-unis-les-femmes-dans-les-starting-blocks-pour-la-presidentielle-de-2020--13-02-2019-2293113_3241.php\">Elizabeth Warren</url>appelle \u00e0 d\u00e9manteler les Big Tech. Le coeur de la lutte anti-Gafam se situe-t-il en Am\u00e9rique du Nord\u00a0?  Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, cette position concerne le camp d\u00e9mocrate, pas forc\u00e9ment majoritaire. Au sein de ce camp, il est vrai que les critiques sont tr\u00e8s fortes. Nombreuses sont les voix qui appellent \u00e0 un recours aux lois anti-trust - ce qui, dans les faits, ne n\u00e9cessite aucun changement l\u00e9gislatif. Pour autant, je dis\u00a0: attention, le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement n'est pas forc\u00e9ment la solution miracle. Lorsqu'on lit dans le d\u00e9tail les d\u00e9clarations des d\u00e9mocrates, on observe qu'ils appellent \u00e0 la d\u00e9construction d'op\u00e9rations de concentration d\u00e9j\u00e0 accept\u00e9es. Le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement de Google laisserait Google Search intact, AdWords intact - soit le g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de cash majeur de Google \u00e0 l'heure actuelle. Ces services ont des positions de march\u00e9 extr\u00eamement fortes, pour ne pas dire monopolistiques. Le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement permettrait d'amoindrir \u00ab\u00a0l'effet pieuvre\u00a0\u00bb de ces acteurs, pas de casser les monopoles en tant que tels.  L'effet pieuvre des grandes plateformes s'incarne, entre autres choses, dans la probl\u00e9matique de la \u00ab\u00a0neutralit\u00e9 des terminaux\u00a0\u00bb, que l'Arcep d\u00e9fend avec force. De quoi s'agit-il\u00a0?   Au sein de l'Arcep, nous militons en faveur de la concurrence et de l'investissement, afin que les r\u00e9seaux soient de bonne qualit\u00e9. L'Arcep d\u00e9fend \u00e9galement la neutralit\u00e9 totale de ces m\u00eames r\u00e9seaux. L'utilisateur est le seul ma\u00eetre \u00e0 bord d\u00e8s lors qu'il s'agit d'utiliser tel ou tel service, d'aller sur tel ou tel site. Mais au-del\u00e0 de la neutralit\u00e9 des r\u00e9seaux, les \u00ab\u00a0tuyaux\u00a0\u00bb, nous d\u00e9fendons la neutralit\u00e9 des terminaux - les \u00ab\u00a0robinets\u00a0\u00bb, c'est-\u00e0-dire nos smartphones, nos tablettes, nos assistants vocaux, et demain nos voitures connect\u00e9es. \u00c0 la suite d'une enqu\u00eate d'un an, nous avons constat\u00e9 que la situation au niveau de ces robinets \u00e9tait catastrophique.  Dans le cas d'un smartphone, les syst\u00e8mes d'exploitation - iOS ou Android, par exemple - limitent strictement les contenus et services auxquels vous pouvez acc\u00e9der. Un exemple, parmi tant d'autres\u00a0: il est impossible de supprimer certaines applications lorsque vous achetez un smartphone. Au final, l'utilisateur est enferm\u00e9 dans un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me. Notre intuition est que cette situation va empirer avec le d\u00e9veloppement de la commande vocale. Lorsque vous serez en voiture et direz \u00e0 votre assistant - Siri, Alexa, Google et j'en passe - de faire les courses pour vous, vous recevrez vos courses en temps et en heure. Probl\u00e8me\u00a0: jamais vous n'aurez choisi la marque des produits, les fournisseurs, le coursier, etc. Il ne s'agit pas de remplacer le pouvoir d'Apple par le pouvoir de l'Arcep\u00a0: nous d\u00e9sirons simplement laisser tous les choix \u00e0 l'utilisateur.    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEPOIN-18283685LPW</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LEPOIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSV-BV01-JCMD-P0SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">341843</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Point Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>LePoint.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"60570\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Mardi 2 Avril 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QC</classCode><className>R\u00c9GLEMENTATION DES T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Communications</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>ENTREPRISE MULTINATIONALE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>\u00c9CONOMIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G3S</classCode><className>R\u00c9GLEMENTATION &amp; POLITIQUE DES COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QC</classCode><className>R\u00c9GLEMENTATION DES T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Communications</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GX470</classCode><className>LILLE, FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS0008XLF</classCode><className>NORD, FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

He referred to\u00a0criticisms he first made in\u00a0a February<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0Age</emphasis> column,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theage.com.au/comment/catalyst-host-maryanne-demasi-in-the-business-of-advocacy-not-journalism-20160222-gn0tkd.html\">where he wrote</url>: </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Demasi's modus operandi is becoming all too familiar. Find a scary thesis that is bound to resonate with many ordinary Australians: people who take statins to lower the chances of cardiovascular disease; parents of young people who are being prescribed antidepressants; people who use mobile telephones a lot, and - a far bigger cohort - the parents of children who use Wi-Fi devices.  \"Find advocates in the scientific world who have plausible credentials --\u00a0plausible, at least to the layperson --\u00a0and who challenge the prevailing scientific orthodoxy: advocates who claim statins are not decreasing, and might even be increasing, the risk of mortality in many of those who are taking them; that antidepressants are inducing psychosis or suicidal tendencies in young people; that prolonged mobile telephone use is probably increasing the risk of brain tumours, and that all Wi-Fi devices might yet prove to be dangerous, especially to children.  \"Give those advocates the lion's share of the space on the ABC's most popular television science program, with the absolute minimum of sceptical challenge. Include token appearances by representatives of the scientific orthodoxy, while implying that various vested interests - big pharma, big telecom, big tech - have undue influence over the regulators.  \"Then, when defenders of the scientific orthodoxy cry 'foul', claim they are attempting to muzzle legitimate debate.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> Yesterday, Demasi\u00a0retweeted a Twitter account that said she needed \"whistleblower protection\", <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/https://twitter.com/MaryanneDemasi/status/750259028794548224\">adding a line</url> that the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Catalyst</emphasis> team had been instructed not to comment on the matter. In recent days, she has been tweeting regularly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/https://twitter.com/MaryanneDemasi/status/748473264993800192\">that</url>\u00a0\"mainstream media is hopelessly conflicted these days by their corporate puppet masters\".  Leading Australian cancer researcher Professor Bernard Stewart       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/https://www.crikey.com.au/2016/02/17/mobiles-might-not-give-you-brain-cancer-but-catalyst-gives-scientists-a-headache/\">told Crikey\u00a0earlier this year</url>\u00a0Demasi's wi-fi story\u00a0was \"biased, and little short of misleading and deceptive\". The program relied heavily on the views of Dr Devra Davis, an American cancer epidemiologist, to argue it was too soon to know the effects of wi-fi radiation on our brains, and that caution in its use was required.  The program was widely panned by the scientific community, but it has found a supportive audience. A response to the criticism on\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Catalyst</emphasis>'s website is followed by dozens of supportive comments thanking the program for opening their eyes.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4411611.htm\">Even Media Watch's report</url> slamming the story is followed by nearly 300 comments, most in support of Demasi's journalism.  But in its review into the validity of several complaints about the program, the audience and consumer affairs division broadly agreed with the experts. It found a number of ways in which one side of the argument was\u00a0given undue prominence to an unorthodox scientific perspective, without signposting to the audience the depth of opposition within the scientific community to the hypothesis. The scientific papers presented as evidence in the episode were not given their proper context. The cumulative effect of all of this, it said, breached the ABC's editorial standard on impartiality.  The division's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FINAL-REPORT-Catalyst-WiFried-Investigation.pdf\">31-page report into the matter</url> did not agree with all the complaints made about the episode. For example, on a complaint that the program would lead viewers to believe mobile phones were responsible for a rise in cancer rates in the United States, the investigation concluded that a claim that it \"may be a factor\" did not amount to a definitive statement that it was. On the use of a controversial image of a child with radiation superimposed over her\u00a0face, this came from a peer-reviewed scientific paper, and so it was not misleading or inappropriate to use it. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There was a scientific basis to this, the review ruled.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p> Nonetheless, \"there is no doubt the investigation of risks posed by widespread wireless devices is an important story, but we believe greater care should have been taken in presenting complex and multiple points of view,\" said ABC director of television Richard Finlayson in a statement.  The program is being removed from the ABC's website. This has happened before with Demasi's work -- a 2013 report on the cholesterol medication\u00a0known as statins was the subject of similar scientific backlash, and subsequently removed upon review. That report, which gave people reasons\u00a0to stop taking their heart medication, would lead to people dying as a result of the program, ABC health journalist Norman Swan said at the\u00a0time, echoing the concerns of public health groups. Another report by Demasi, produced after the statins program, looked at the use and misuse of antidepressants -- <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> understands\u00a0senior editors stopped it going to air.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">[<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/https://www.crikey.com.au/2013/10/31/media-and-a-scientific-leap-of-faith-a-catalyst-for-thought/\">Media and a scientific leap of faith: a Catalyst for thought</url>]</emphasis>  Holmes told<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Crikey</emphasis>\u00a0that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Catalyst</emphasis> has suffered from a lack of strong editorial oversight. The program does not have an executive producer, though series producer\u00a0Ingrid Arnott, the program's series producer, is the senior editor on the show..  \"There's no question in my mind that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Catalyst</emphasis> has traditionally given a lot of power to its reporters, who are all qualified scientists, and who are able to pull rank over those who aren't,\" Holmes said. \"Particularly in disputes about the merits of a particular paper, for example.\"  \"When I wrote about this [in a February column for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Age</emphasis>], I spoke to [ABC head of editorial policy] Alan Sunderland. His role is to apply the same editorial policies across the ABC. He told me this program went through the normal editorial controls. If that's the case, they're simply not strong enough, and they need to be beefed up.\"  If <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Catalyst</emphasis> is returned to a \"magazine-style\" program and the ABC no longer does investigative science journalism, Holmes said that would be a pity. \"I think there should always be a place for investigative scientific journalism that does query the status quo. But you've got to have editorial controls and the skills to do it.\"  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Catalyst</emphasis> is currently housed within the ABC's television division, which while subject to the same editorial polices, has looser structures around editorial controls (at the news and current affairs division, executive producers are culturally expected to query and have the power to change every aspect of what is going to go to air -- many TV programs, outside the ABC news division, share executive producers, who have many responsibilities). Meanwhile other ABC science programs, like the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Health Report</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Science Show</emphasis>, air on Radio National and are thus under the radio division.  The ABC's news and current affairs division is where most ABC journalists\u00a0get their training in how to do difficult journalism, says Holmes. And the fact that the ABC's science reporters are scattered among different divisions can complicate career paths and make collaboration harder.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K5N-WN31-F0NT-H4PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1497\"/><timeReceived>12:49:06 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>July 6, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX001113</classCode><className>MENTAL ILLNESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DL9P</classCode><className>TUMORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002102</classCode><className>NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS &amp; INJURIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001647</classCode><className>SUICIDE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000259</classCode><className>CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001845</classCode><className>WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000260</classCode><className>CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST0008XSI</classCode><className>ANTIDEPRESSANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001702</classCode><className>TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001704</classCode><className>TELEVISION PROGRAMMING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001694</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000269</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Yang did formerly support[1] breaking up the tech giant, according to ABC News. </p><p>But in the last couple of weeks, the candidate has flipped his stance on the issue.On July 19, Yang told The Hill that competition in the tech industry 'would not address some of the fundamental problems.' The candidate feels that breaking up the company is a '20th century approach to a 21st century problem.'Tech companies stick together. In this same time frame, it just so happens that Twitter CEO[2] Jack Dorsey and co-chairman[3] of Open AI[4] Sam Altman announced that they are getting behind Yang's campaign.Yang's background is closely affiliated with the Silicon Valley. The candidate spent over seven years building a nonprofit organization called[5] Venture for America whose purpose is to 'revitalize America.' Linkedin CEO[6] Jeff Weiner and Silicon Valley leader[7] Reid Hoffman have shown support for the organization.Google has recently been involved in many scandals, perhaps the biggest one being the University of Chicago medical scandal. The tech giant was sharing patient's check-in and discharge dates and times with the university. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA[8]) this is illegal. On June 26, leading plaintiff lawyer and founder of Edelson PC[9], Jay Edelson, told The New York Times[10] he believes this is \"the most significant health care data breach case in our nation's history.\"Yang's plan[11] seems like it will allow Google to repeat the pattern.

Yang did formerly support[1] breaking up the tech giant, according to ABC News. </p><p>But in the last couple of weeks, the candidate has flipped his stance on the issue.On July 19, Yang told The Hill that competition in the tech industry 'would not address some of the fundamental problems.' The candidate feels that breaking up the company is a '20th century approach to a 21st century problem.'Tech companies stick together. In this same time frame, it just so happens that Twitter CEO[2] Jack Dorsey and co-chairman[3] of Open AI[4] Sam Altman announced that they are getting behind Yang's campaign.Yang's background is closely affiliated with the Silicon Valley. The candidate spent over seven years building a nonprofit organization called[5] Venture for America whose purpose is to 'revitalize America.' Linkedin CEO[6] Jeff Weiner and Silicon Valley leader[7] Reid Hoffman have shown support for the organization.Google has recently been involved in many scandals, perhaps the biggest one being the University of Chicago medical scandal. The tech giant was sharing patient's check-in and discharge dates and times with the university. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA[8]) this is illegal. On June 26, leading plaintiff lawyer and founder of Edelson PC[9], Jay Edelson, told The New York Times[10] he believes this is \"the most significant health care data breach case in our nation's history.\"Yang's plan[11] seems like it will allow Google to repeat the pattern.

Once a ubiquitous talking point in Democratic politics, the words \"Wall Street\" were mentioned fewer than half a dozen times over the two nights of debate in Miami. Even Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders - two progressives famed for going after the financial system - made little mention of big banks from their positions at center stage. </p><p>Instead, the 20 candidates and moderators turned their attention to health care, climate change, immigration and economic inequality. More than a decade after the 2008 financial meltdown, the silent treatment toward the industry pointed to the waning power of post-crisis angst in U.S. politics. \"On a scale of one to 10 on importance, financial services and regulation are not in that 10,\" said Robert Wolf, former head of UBS Group's Americas Unit and founder of the strategy and investment firm 32 Advisors. \"We're very different from where we were five and 10 years ago.\" With the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act now almost fully implemented, there's the perception among some that the major regulation of Wall Street has already been done. \"Wholesale changes for the most part have taken place,\" said Wolf, who has donated to multiple Democrats running for the 2020 nomination. The most prominent mention of Wall Street came Thursday night from the Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, who said in his opening remarks that \"Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary, middle-class Americans built America.\" Under the regulators appointed by President Donald Trump, the banking industry has benefited from a slow but steady process to ease rules put in place after the crisis. Lenders have been performing well, with the six biggest in the U.S. posting a record profit last year exceeding $120 billion. \"It's a very tired argument to beat up on banks this many years after the crisis,\" said Charles Myers, who was vice chairman of Evercore Inc. before he started Signum Global Advisors, which does policy research for financial companies. Big tech and the pharmaceutical industry have become the new regulatory targets for Democrats, Myers said. And with the U.S. economy running relatively strong, and unemployment at 3.6 percent, railing against Wall Street banks may not be as effective for Democrats as it was when unemployment touched 10 percent in the depths of the crisis. Still, Democrats remain known as the anti-Wall Street party, and that legacy carries over in the platforms of the candidates. Sanders has proposed a securities transaction tax as a way to pay for his plan to eliminate student debt, one of the few Wall Street-related proposals to get air time during the debate. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has introduced a bill to step up the powers that state regulators wield over national banks. \"Just because they're not the latest flavor of the month, it doesn't mean that financial services doesn't have a target on its back,\" said Stephen Myrow, managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors in Washington. \"The hot button issues right now are things like health care, big tech and immigration. That doesn't mean that if a Democrat was to become president that financial services wouldn't get attacked.\" Thursday's debate tops for Democrats NBC says round two of the Democratic presidential debate was the party's most-watched ever. Based on Nielsen figures out Friday, the event including early front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders averaged 18.1 million viewers across NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo. That topped the previous Democratic debate audience high of 15.5 million for an October 2015 event, which included eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. Neither approached the audience for the first 2016 GOP primary debate, with newcomer Donald Trump driving curiosity. It drew nearly 24 million viewers on Fox News Channel.

Bernie Sanders take part in the second night of the Democratic debate Thursday.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street emerged almost entirely unscathed from the first Democratic presidential debate, with no questions to candidates and few comments on an industry that has long been a favorite target of liberals. Once a ubiquitous talking point in Democratic politics, the words  Wall Street  were mentioned fewer than half a dozen times over the two nights of debate in Miami. Even Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders  two progressives famed for going after the financial system   made little mention of big banks from their positions at center stage. </p><p>Instead, the 20 candidates and moderators turned their attention to health care, climate change, immigration and economic inequality. More than a decade after the 2008 financial meltdown, the silent treatment toward the industry pointed to the waning power of post-crisis angst in U.S. politics.  On ascale of one to 10 on importance, financial services and regulation are not in that 10,  said Robert Wolf, former head of UBS Group s Americas Unit and founder of the strategy and investment firm 32 Advisors.  We re very different from where we were five and 10 years ago.  With the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act now almost fully implemented, there s the perception among some that the major regulation of Wall Street has already been done.  Wholesale changes for the most part have taken place,  said Wolf, who has donated to multiple Democrats running for the 2020 nomination. The most prominent mention of Wall Street came Thursday night from the Democratic frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, who said in his opening remarks that  Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary, middle-class Americans built America.  Under the regulators appointed by President Donald Trump, the banking industry has benefited from a slow but steady process to ease rules put in place after the crisis. Lenders have been performing well, with the six biggest in the U.S. posting a record profit last year exceeding $120 billion.  It s a very tired argument to beat up on banks this many years after the crisis,  said Charles Myers, who was vice chairman of Evercore Inc. before he started Signum Global Advisors, which does policy research for financial companies. Big tech and the pharmaceutical industry have become the new regulatory targets for Democrats, Myers said. And with the U.S. economy running relatively strong, and unemployment at 3.6 percent, railing against Wall Street banks may not be as effective for Democrats as it was when unemployment touched 10 percent in the depths of the crisis. Still, Democrats remain known as the anti-Wall Street party, and that legacy carries over in the platforms of the candidates. Sanders has proposed a securities transaction tax as a way to pay for his plan to eliminate student debt, one of the few Wall Street-related proposals to get air time during the debate. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has introduced a bill to step up the powers that state regulators wield over national banks.  Just because they re not the latest flavor of the month, it doesn t mean that financial services doesn t have a target on its back,  said Stephen Myrow, managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors in Washington.  The hot button issues right now are things like health care, big tech and immigration. That doesn t mean that if a Democrat was to become president that financial services wouldn t get attacked.  ... Thursday s debate tops for Democrats NBC says round two of the Democratic presidential debate was the party s most-watched ever. Based on Nielsen figures out Friday, the event including early front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders averaged 18.1 million viewers across NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo. That topped the previous Democratic debate audience high of 15.5 million for an October 2015 event, which included eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. Neither approached the audience for the first 2016 GOP primary debate, with newcomer Donald Trump driving curiosity. It drew nearly 24 million viewers on Fox News Channel.

It's natural, it's healthy, to start to ask those questions of the former darlings of the Democratic Party.\"</p><p>The tech conversation kicked off with a question from the moderators about whether the candidates supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) proposal to \"break up Big Tech\" \u00af one of the first plans she offered after launching her bid this year.</p><p>Warren has set the tone for the Democratic debate on technology issues since she announced her proposal back in March, a plan that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and put the industry on high alert. But for months, candidates have hedged and side-stepped about where they come down on the issue, sporadically offering smaller-scale proposals to rein in Big Tech.</p><p>None of the other candidates, though, explicitly endorsed Warren's approach, which would impose tougher antitrust rules and require companies including Google and Facebook to spin off elements of their businesses.</p><p>\"I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up,\" former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) said. But he added, \"We will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that.\"</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also did not explicitly back Warren's calls for breaking up the companies, saying only that he would appoint officials who would \"take on these huge monopolies.\"</p><p>\"I think the conversation has evolved from a draconian view of breakup of tech to, 'What is the right regulation?' \" a tech industry insider told The Hill about the divisions on display. \"That's the conversation that we've been wanting to have and that we want to engage regulators and policymakers on.\"</p><p>Despite the lack of consensus, antitrust experts and tech critics said the debate highlighted the serious concerns among voters about corporate power, particularly with tech firms.</p><p>\"When you see an issue like this animate a presidential race, it's indicative of something that resonates with the public,\" said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \"There's a lot of momentum, and it's indicative of widespread concern about the power of tech monopolies and large corporations across the economy.\"</p><p>The candidates touched on a wide range of tech issues.</p><p>At the debate, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang called for treating data as personal property, O'Rourke said he believes social media companies should do more to combat extremist content online, while Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) hit Twitter over its policy offering more leniency to political speech.</p><p>Harris tangled with Warren over whether Twitter should ban Trump's account. Harris has pressed Twitter on the issue, arguing that Trump has used the social media platform to incite violence and spread baseless accusations. And at the debate she challenged Warren over the issue. Warren herself is pushing Facebook to crack down on disinformation but has declined to join Harris's efforts on Twitter.</p><p>In a memorable exchange, she told the California senator her focus was getting Trump out of the White House, not off Twitter. Warren said the U.S. could better deal with tech companies by beefing up and enforcing the antitrust laws on the books.</p><p>John Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust attorney who's now an assistant professor of law at the University of Memphis, said political watchers would need to go back over a century to find the last time antitrust issues played such a prominent role in a campaign.</p><p>\"You'd really have to go back to 1912, to the last great antitrust debates, to see any kind of parallel,\" Newman said. \"And at least back in the day, it was a harbinger of big things to come.\"</p><p>But industry voices downplayed the talk of reining in Big Tech.</p><p>Steve DelBianco, the president of tech trade group NetChoice, called the criticisms \"predictable.\"</p><p>\"It plays to their base to show that they're standing up to big companies and that they care about election security, privacy, violent and extreme content.\"</p><p>Warren and Yang also clashed over the impact of automation during the debate. Warren defended remarks that automation was a \"good story\" blaming bad policies for the loss of jobs.</p><p>But Yang fired back, telling Warren, \"I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they're smart. They see ... Main Street stores are closing, they see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald's, every grocery store, every CVS.\"</p><p>A number of Democratic candidates have unveiled proposals to address the so-called gig economy and how those companies treat workers.</p><p>The candidates were far more united on the issue of addressing election security, with the candidates uniformly calling for more steps to protect U.S. elections in the future.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) argued in favor of ensuring the security of the 2020 elections by making sure every state used backup paper ballots and passing the Honest Ads Act.</p><p>This legislation, which Klobuchar introduced earlier this year alongside Sens. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), would require social media platforms to disclose who paid for political ads on their sites, along with other steps to increase transparency of political advertisements.

It's natural, it's healthy, to start to ask those questions of the former darlings of the Democratic Party.\"</p><p>The tech conversation kicked off with a question from the moderators about whether the candidates supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) proposal to \"break up Big Tech\" \u00af one of the first plans she offered after launching her bid this year.</p><p>Warren has set the tone for the Democratic debate on technology issues since she announced her proposal back in March, a plan that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and put the industry on high alert. But for months, candidates have hedged and side-stepped about where they come down on the issue, sporadically offering smaller-scale proposals to rein in Big Tech.</p><p>None of the other candidates, though, explicitly endorsed Warren's approach, which would impose tougher antitrust rules and require companies including Google and Facebook to spin off elements of their businesses.</p><p>\"I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up,\" former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) said. But he added, \"We will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that.\"</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also did not explicitly back Warren's calls for breaking up the companies, saying only that he would appoint officials who would \"take on these huge monopolies.\"</p><p>\"I think the conversation has evolved from a draconian view of breakup of tech to, 'What is the right regulation?' \" a tech industry insider told The Hill about the divisions on display. \"That's the conversation that we've been wanting to have and that we want to engage regulators and policymakers on.\"</p><p>Despite the lack of consensus, antitrust experts and tech critics said the debate highlighted the serious concerns among voters about corporate power, particularly with tech firms.</p><p>\"When you see an issue like this animate a presidential race, it's indicative of something that resonates with the public,\" said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \"There's a lot of momentum, and it's indicative of widespread concern about the power of tech monopolies and large corporations across the economy.\"</p><p>The candidates touched on a wide range of tech issues.</p><p>At the debate, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang called for treating data as personal property, O'Rourke said he believes social media companies should do more to combat extremist content online, while Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) hit Twitter over its policy offering more leniency to political speech.</p><p>Harris tangled with Warren over whether Twitter should ban Trump's account. Harris has pressed Twitter on the issue, arguing that Trump has used the social media platform to incite violence and spread baseless accusations. And at the debate she challenged Warren over the issue. Warren herself is pushing Facebook to crack down on disinformation but has declined to join Harris's efforts on Twitter.</p><p>In a memorable exchange, she told the California senator her focus was getting Trump out of the White House, not off Twitter. Warren said the U.S. could better deal with tech companies by beefing up and enforcing the antitrust laws on the books.</p><p>John Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust attorney who's now an assistant professor of law at the University of Memphis, said political watchers would need to go back over a century to find the last time antitrust issues played such a prominent role in a campaign.</p><p>\"You'd really have to go back to 1912, to the last great antitrust debates, to see any kind of parallel,\" Newman said. \"And at least back in the day, it was a harbinger of big things to come.\"</p><p>But industry voices downplayed the talk of reining in Big Tech.</p><p>Steve DelBianco, the president of tech trade group NetChoice, called the criticisms \"predictable.\"</p><p>\"It plays to their base to show that they're standing up to big companies and that they care about election security, privacy, violent and extreme content.\"</p><p>Warren and Yang also clashed over the impact of automation during the debate. Warren defended remarks that automation was a \"good story\" blaming bad policies for the loss of jobs.</p><p>But Yang fired back, telling Warren, \"I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they're smart. They see ... Main Street stores are closing, they see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald's, every grocery store, every CVS.\"</p><p>A number of Democratic candidates have unveiled proposals to address the so-called gig economy and how those companies treat workers.</p><p>The candidates were far more united on the issue of addressing election security, with the candidates uniformly calling for more steps to protect U.S. elections in the future.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) argued in favor of ensuring the security of the 2020 elections by making sure every state used backup paper ballots and passing the Honest Ads Act.</p><p>This legislation, which Klobuchar introduced earlier this year alongside Sens. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), would require social media platforms to disclose who paid for political ads on their sites, along with other steps to increase transparency of political advertisements. But the bill has not moved in the Senate.</p><p>Yang saw election security as part of a broader problem.</p><p>He noted that Russia's election interference efforts were an \"illustration of 21st century threats,\" citing cybersecurity, military drones and artificial intelligence as issues confronting the U.S.</p><p>\"We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology,\" Yang said, vowing to close that gap if elected president.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y51-C821-JCB9-401T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1145\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

Bernie Sanders assailed the power of Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. Cory Booker vowed to appoint more judges and antitrust enforcers and even Joe Biden is preparing a trust-busting plan. Democratic presidential hopefuls are coming out in force against the rapid pace of corporate consolidation, a message to 2020 voters that gained volume during their first debates in Miami last week. </p><p>They're expanding their pledges to take on big tech, including Facebook and Alphabet, to other industries. Attacking big corporations is both a political message and a policy prescription. It's one way Democrats think they can address the concerns of voters who have fallen behind, even as the U.S. economy continues to expand. As Democrats gear up to try to take back the White House in 2020, they hope the anti-corporate tone taps into the populist passion that propelled Donald Trump in 2016. \"Whoever is elected on the Democratic side would be more aggressive on antitrust than we have seen in decades,\" said Jason Furman, a former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers who chairs a U.K. initiative on digital competition. So far, voters views are mixed, but it's a message that could take hold as frustration grows with large companies and concerns, including how personal data are being used. With that in mind, some of the party's top candidates are warning of a new robber-baron era, recalling the powerful oil and steel behemoths of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the first American antitrust laws were designed to tame. Their campaigns often cite studies showing that consolidation may be responsible for higher wealth inequality, slower productivity growth, fewer startups and stagnant wages. The candidates are putting together plans to target a wide range of industries including agribusiness, telecom and health care. Booker, for example, has offered legislation that places an indefinite moratorium on acquisitions in the food and agriculture sector and Amy Klobuchar sponsored an antitrust overhaul that would require merging companies to prove their consolidation wouldn't harm competition. The proposals mark a shift from previous administrations that had a lighter regulatory touch, allowing consolidation in almost every sector of the U.S. economy. More than three-quarters of U.S. industries over the last two decades have seen an increase in concentration, studies show. Markups - how much a company charges for a product above its own costs - have soared, another sign of rising market power. These findings are consistent with research showing a smaller number of firms across the U.S. economy capturing a greater share of sales, giving rise to so-called superstar companies. Democrats already started questioning this trend after winning the House majority last year. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the antitrust subcommittee chairman, is investigating concentration in the tech industry. The U.S., he has said, is in the midst of a \"monopoly moment\" that stifles competition. One of Cicilline's questions is why there hasn't been a \"serious antitrust investigation\" in 20 years. At the same time, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have carved up oversight of four tech giants, with the Justice Department taking responsibility for Alphabet's Google and Apple, while the FTC is investigating Facebook and Amazon.com. These inquiries could gather steam under a Democratic president, who sets the tone for antitrust enforcement through appointees to the Justice Department and the FTC. A Democratic White House would also likely deploy broader agency regulatory authority to check the power of dominant companies in many industries. That includes the Transportation Department on airlines, the Department of Health and Human Services on insurance and pharmaceutical companies, the Federal Communications Commission on telecom providers, and the Agriculture Department on agribusiness giants, according to Gene Kimmelman, chief counsel for competition policy in the Obama Justice Department, now chairman of Public Knowledge, an advocacy group. For example, the Agriculture Department's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration could restore a regulation the Reagan administration removed barring meat packers from having an interest in feed lots, reducing the packers' leverage in purchasing livestock.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SANTEX-MERLIN68621806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANTEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGW-FDW1-JC8S-D227-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

vast amounts of data on its users, from their birthdays to their hobbies and relationships. </p><p>The researchers urged policymakers to establish a new regulatory framework for what they termed \"Systemically Important Technological Institutions\", which would treat social media sites in a similar way to critical national infrastructure and public utilities.</p><p>This would require that it would be possible for the \"essential services\" provided by Facebook, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/31/like-value-big-tech-determined-do/\">such as acting as a place for discussion for billions of people</url>, to be \"maintained or transferred\" to another company.</p><p>New laws should be put in place to stop companies being able to arbitrarily auction out user data, and there should be stronger privacy protections for deceased users, preventing Facebook selling or mining their accounts for information, the researchers said. </p><p>Nikita Aggarwal, who co-authored the report, said: \"The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted the systemic importance of platforms such as Facebook to the exchange of information in today's society, providing vital access to public health advice and keeping communities connected through digital communication tools. </p><p>\"As such, there are compelling reasons to regulate these platforms as systemically important

They have experience of working on press freedom, fighting disinformation, copyright, and public regulation.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dear President, Frau Dr. Ursula von der Leyen,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your July nomination speech highlighted two related top priorities: Democracy, and Making Europe fit for the digital age, in the broader context of Europe's sovereignty. To uphold European values requires a sustainable, pluralistic and trustworthy media ecosystem. Democracy is fading and the European project is endangered by the lack of a real strategy for the media sector, so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We also welcome the Parliament's stronger endorsement on 27 November, taking into account your Mission Letters, and commitments by your colleagues closest to media issues: Executive VP Margrethe Vestager, VP Vera Jourov\u00e1, Commissioners Mariya Gabriel and Thierry Breton.</p><p>Democracy and media crises are clear enough: we should now focus on remedies - and their efficient implementation. All actors need an adjusted regulatory framework (alongside existing competition rules), building on prior processes.</p><p> One should accelerate parallel efforts, notably fighting disinformation, avoiding platforms' tax evasion and privacy breaches, plus broader actions like digitalisation, media literacy and innovation, and transparency on media ownership.\u00a0</p><p>We note your requested Digital Services Act. Several further strategies should be coordinated with it. This includes Vera Jourov\u00e1's Democracy Action Plan, and a European strategy for the media sector, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/opinion/beyond-fake-news-strategic-options-ahead-of-eu-elections/\">already called for by MEPs and stakeholders</url>, now announced in Thierry Breton's answers to the Parliament: '<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> [...] will </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">present\u00a0 an </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">action\u00a0 plan on the competitiveness and [...] pluralism of the audio-visual sector and the media'</emphasis>. </p><p>Building on your Commission's commitment to industrial policy, we suggest to have not just a Digital Services Act and legislative initiatives, but <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">one horizontal</emphasis> 'digital umbrella vision', plus <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">several vertical</emphasis> 'sector strategies', concerning media, AI (artificial intelligence), e-commerce, industry, etc. </p><p>Any sector's strategy may include a 'smart policy mix', notably: (co)-regulation - including interpretation of competition rules and legislative initiatives - education (of professionals and users), support to Innovation or R&amp;D or industrial projects.\u00a0</p><p>Before suggesting actions, let us leave aside the usual justifications for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">laissez-faire</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p>This includes scarecrows ('Ministry of the truth', or extreme versions of 'internet freedom' and 'level-playing field' allegedly overriding other principles). And also good ideas that are not realistic ('breaking up the giant platforms').\u00a0 We are in Europe, not America.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Faster co-regulation, not just self-regulation\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Regarding the fight against 'fake news', monthly reports underline known weaknesses of the platforms' <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=54454\">Code of practice</url>.

Its report recommended not just self-regulation, but co<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-</emphasis>regulation: setting standards below which public regulation would kick-in. </p><p>This was the key compromise sentence: '<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">As a second step, the Commission is invited to re-examine the matter in Spring 2019 and decide [...] whether further actions\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should be considered for the next European Commission term. This may cover options for additional fact-finding and/or policy initiatives, using any rele</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vant instrument, including competition instruments [...].\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>We are a few months late: now is the time to act. Not just regarding disinformation: co-regulation is relevant for many aspects of platforms' position and behaviour.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trust indicators: promoting quality, not censoring 'fake news'</emphasis></p><p>The chief issue is: how to make sure that good content crowds out the bad? In other words: how to dilute fake news and 'click bait', via greater visibility for genuine users and quality content? This is possible, given today's algorithms, if well 'fed' with the right 'signals'. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Item-by-item</emphasis> evaluation by fact-checkers is relevant but too slow. </p><p>One should assess <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sources, not negatively by </emphasis>censoring any, but <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">positively: </emphasis>highlighting the most credibl<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e </emphasis>ones. Algorithms are good at generating loads of relevant advertising, they can also promote relevant content quality. </p><p>Trust indicators are not a blunt black or white certification, but rather '50 shades of credibility'. Combined with respect for the copyright directive, this could indirectly boost the viewership and revenue of quality media.\u00a0</p><p>Trust Indicators are not new: they feature (in different ways) both in the work of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/media4eu/opinion/avoid-censorship-dilute-fake-with-quality-news/\">Expert Group on disinformation</url>, and in the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/code-practice-disinformation\">Code of Practice</url>. However, they are not really in place, in the sense of independent, outside input into platforms' algorithms. </p><p>Should platforms do all this: 'negotiate' content access, decide on visibility, steer user data, set advertising conditions? and then also assess content credibility? Of course not alone, and not just by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/27/facebook-only-dutch-factchecker-quits-over-political-ad-exemption\">picking themselves some subcontractors</url>.\u00a0</p><p>Some stakeholders even envision an open market for Trust Indicators. Users would be able to replace the default Indicator with their own choices. This would go with greater control over one's data, including portability at users' choice, for example from platforms to one's favourite media. For Mrs Vestager, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/vestager-calls-for-more-access-to-data-for-small-platforms/\">access to data is key for competition from smaller players.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Systemic platforms for democracy, like banks for the economy</emphasis></p><p>To avoid unnecessary red tape for all, the focus should be narrow. 'Systemic Publishing Platforms' (nickname <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SysPPees</emphasis>) is a new wording, building on previous concepts. Dominant in a number of markets, platforms are an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'essential facility</emphasis>', a 'must' gatekeeper for other actors and for users. This labelling can create obligations under competition case law, and speed-up adaptation of national laws and/or EU regulations.\u00a0</p><p>While media, telecoms operators and platforms disagree on many points, all would agree that SysPPees are neither journalist-driven nor mere 'pipes'. What we need is a 'third category', between infrastructure and professional journalism.\u00a0</p><p>Why use the word 'platform'? It is the one they choose, after initially calling themselves social <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">media</emphasis>. They are neither telecoms infrastructure (content regulated lightly), nor a journalistic media (heavily regulated broadcasting and semi-self-regulated press). After many controversies, that lack of liability for platforms is over.</p><p>Why 'publishing'? Inviting, hosting, selecting and promoting content is the essence of many platform services. Whatever the content (from article to messages and data), whatever the tools (journalists' or artificial intelligence), it is still publishing. Massive publishing requires IT, and this is not a reason to lower the standards, quite the contrary.</p><p>Why 'systemic'? One should be <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">technology</emphasis>-neutral, not size- and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">power</emphasis>-neutral. Executive Vice-President<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/copyright/news/vestager-takes-aim-at-biopower-of-tech-giants/\">Vestager talks about the 'biopower' of platforms</url>, implying that it should be supervised and regulated. SysPPees are critical to democracy, like media too - the fourth estate - and like banks for the economy. Unlike some systemic banks ten years ago, platforms don't need a bailout, far from it...</p><p>Building on competition concepts for digital regulation makes sense: this is the spirit of the recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/business-business-trading-practices\">Regulation on Platform-to-business trading practices</url>. This should be expanded to cover all SysPPees' services and will help the media recover some of its lifeblood: advertising revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Defining SysPPees allows differentiated legislation, and speed</emphasis></p><p>Defining the platforms better will both facilitate using existing rules, and allow differentiated legislation. Data privacy rules were initially aimed chiefly at platforms. They are legitimate but so onerous for SMEs and NGOs that many have recourse to... SysPPees and other services to manage users' data. Should a local association be subject to the same rules as Facebook? Of course not.\u00a0</p><p>Given the deep links between their entities (ownership, commercial, technical and data), two giants should be handled first, as groups: Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. Based on the same objective criteria updated dynamically,\u00a0 Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and a few others could be addressed later.</p><p>President von der Leyen, you have set a 100-day deadline for several legislative initiatives. This cannot work within the usual silo thinking, or it would lead to poor drafts sent to Council and Parliament, and inconclusive debates. </p><p>Beyond your agreed priorities, you need <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/opinion/cooperation-of-four-key-commissioners-needed-for-healthy-media-democracy/\">the right coordination between Commissioners</url>, plus a task force within the services. And then cooperation with Member States too. The momentum will increase with a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">strategy for Europe's media sector</emphasis>, plus a few concepts across initiatives, like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SysPPees </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Trust Indicators</emphasis>. Both users' choice and democracy in Europe will benefit.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">* </emphasis>Signatories:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MEPs &amp;

This article aims to discuss the relationship between democracy and the \"algorithmic turn\" - which the authors define as the \"central and strategic role of data processing and automated reasoning in electoral processes, governance and decision making.\" In doing so the authors help us understand how this phenomenon is influencing society - both positively and negatively - and what are the practical implications we see as a result.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KEYWORDS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Algorithms | Democracy | Elections | Governance</p><p>Democracy is at a turning point. On the one side, refreshing experiments in decentralisation and the horizontalisation of political processes are reinventing the boundaries of democracy, whether it be the rise of youth in formal politics in India and Mexico,1 the reclamation of community self-governance in urban spaces such as in the case of the networked Spanish municipalities,2 or the rise of a new DIY (Do it Yourself) citizen ethos.3 On the other, a range of developments - unanticipated electoral mandates that have stunned the pundits such as the US presidential election of 2016; an expanding trust deficit between state and citizen in many parts of the world4 and reduced faith in institutions of democracy;5 the quest for extra-institutional possibilities of leadership outside traditional venues of action such as government, unions, political parties etc;6 the polarisation of the public sphere, and a disconcerting collusion between the techno-capitalist class and the technocratic informational state - point to new challenges for democracy.7</p><p>With the invisible hand of technology increasingly revealing itself, citizenship itself is at a crossroads. Manipulated masterfully by data-driven tactics, citizens find themselves increasingly slotted into the respective sides of an ever growing and unforgiving ideology divide. However, with the ability to mobilise 140 characters and a handy hashtag, they have also managed to appropriate the digital landscape as a decisive frontier for all shades of civic engagement. From the #FeesMustFall movement student uprisings in South Africa8 to the protests against sexual violence against women and girls in India9 the online world seems to have secured its place as the stage for civic-public action.</p><p>This essay explores the role of the algorithmic turn - what we define here as the central and strategic role data processing and automated reasoning - basically, deployment of digital intelligence tactics - in electoral processes, governance and decision making - in relation to the democratic transition underway. We first discuss the ways in which digital intelligence is influencing and dictating voter behaviors and outcomes. Second, we look at the increasing role of data and algorithms in governance and policy decision processes and the implications for citizen rights. Lastly, we bring to fore some questions on the governance of such technological integration in democratic processes.10</p><p>1? Your vote, their tech! How Big Data and big tech are making and unmaking elections</p><p>From the somewhat simplistic studies of the early days of mass media technologies such as the role of radio, film and newspapers in war time11 to more recent work that has looked at the role of cell phones and Big Data12 in elections,13 technology's ability to diffuse key messages and propaganda by vested interests has been long acknowledged.</p><p>However, the tools and tactics of public sphere manipulation we are witnessing today are unprecedented. The unethical use of Big Data and machine learning14 to \"game\" the public sphere in pernicious ways marks a new point of departure. For example, through the intense level of surveillance of voters afforded through digital tools, Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows political influence to move from public campaigns to private sentiment,15 a shift that repositions electoral politics from a spectacle that is overt to a script that is covert.</p><p>Also, as the Internet has grown, so has misinformation. It is often claimed that we live in times of \"post-truth\". What this means is that as the virality, speed and reach of digital information increases, a mind-boggling multiplicity of narratives emerge that displace singular and authoritative grand narratives. The fact that we can choose which communities we want to be connected to means that the received wisdom of societies - the common knowledge and norms shared across communities - break down.16 In this flux, social and political sentiment of individuals and communities becomes vulnerable to manipulation and gaming.</p><p>In March 2018, as this piece was being written, the Guardian published the explosive news about how Cambridge Analytica, a once obscure data analytics firm, had - through harvesting Facebook users' data - engineered victories for the Brexit Leave campaign in the UK and the Donald Trump campaign in the United States' presidential elections.17 The expos\u00e9 reveals not merely the large scale of manipulation of users that the techno-paradigm makes possible, but the real implications of behavioural and psychographic profiling and targeting of voters on actual electoral outcomes. The firm's unscrupulous tactics included scraping (a form of automated data collection) and exploiting user data from Facebook without informed consent and offering monetary incentives for participating in quizzes that were cleverly disguised psychological probes.18 Further, this data was used to engage in polarized messaging and fake news dissemination.</p><p>Twitter assumed centre stage in the Mexican political theater in 2012. The failure of mainstream media to report on drug violence owing to threats from cartels had meant that Mexican citizens were already dependent on Twitter for news and updates. Campaigners for the parties in the general election, capatalised on this, spamming the network with thousands of bots19 that worked round the clock to promote particular new topics and make the trending topics list aligned with the interests of the campaigners, flooding the space with pointless \"flame wars\"20 that left no scope for deep engagement.21 What we see is that the technological structures of the day built into the media platforms widely used and abused in everyday politics directly have a bearing on how political processes and outcomes are shaped.</p><p>The 2017 French presidential elections showed just how extensive the use of bots can be. In May 2017, the Oxford Internet Institute conducted an analysis ofthe #MacronLeaks hashtag, which involved a data dump of the then presidential candidate's email correspondence. It found that 50 per cent of the Twitter content consisting of leaked documents and falsified reports was generated by only three percent of the total number ofTwitter accounts. These bot accounts were pushing out 1,500 unique tweets per hour garnering an average of 9,500 retweets. The study concluded that over 22.8 million Twitter users were exposed to this information every hour on election day in France.22</p><p>Older practices such as gerrymandering - the manipulation of the boundaries of an electoral constituency so as to bring political advantage for a particular party23 - have found new impetus in the predictive power of Big Data. Gerrymandering has been shown to contribute to increased political polarisation,24 with disproportionate impacts on the poor. Elected leaders in such polarised constituencies typically tend to avoid taking up issues about economic inequality.25 What may be inferred from the above discussion is that while data based electioneering can potentially bring new efficiencies and effectiveness to organising and campaigning, the fact that the technological platforms that define the public sphere today are controlled by the elite does not bear well for the system of electoral democracy as a whole. In theory, the digital intelligence extracted from data cuts down on human resource intensive work, allows for grassroots organisers to optimise their canvassing and can mitigate the distortions of big capital in elections by allowing candidates to reach their constituencies over social media, at literally no cost. However, if the Cambridge Analytica or the MacronLeaks episode shows us anything, it is that we are headed for a vastly different future, one in which voter behaviour is being manipulated towards particular outcomes that may reflect neither a democratic mandate nor informed choice.</p><p>These developments pose a crisis for the public sphere. Borrowing from Dewey, \"publics\" in a democracy are created through \"indirect, extensive, enduring and serious consequences of conjoint and interacting behavior\".26 Gamed by capital and technology, the very formation of publics is at risk today, with citizen interaction driven into information echo chambers that reinforce and amplify deep bias, resulting in a banality that prevents deliberation and posing particular risks, especially to already marginalised populations.</p><p>2? Algorithm see, algorithm do</p><p>While elections are flashpoints - newsworthy by their very nature - the everyday practices of democracy, routine and largely unremarkable, rarely grab the same kind of media attention. However, it is often the structures and practices of everyday citizenstate interaction that become critical in furthering the kind of institutional change that can ultimately contribute to make democracy transformative.</p><p>Undoubtedly, there are advantages and efficiencies that digitally mediated governance can afford, such as easier access to information and entitlements for the citizen, and greater transparency and responsiveness for state institutions. E-government arrangements can also help achieve the objectives of participatory governance. The rise of an online network of municipalities in Spain is an excellent example that demonstrates this.27 However, when state-citizen engagement goes online into digital modalities and governance architectures become digitalised, they do pose administrative and legislative challenges, with significant implications for citizen rights.28</p><p>Today, around the world technologies of calculation and regulation are being deployed to enact and regulate their subjects - citizens, migrants, consumers, students, colleagues and many more.29 Algorithms define the information to be acted upon, engage in \"social sorting\"30 and create autonomous repertoires of action and reaction. \"Algorithms 'govern' because they have the power to structure possibilities,\" notes Ananny.31 Napoli even argues that algorithms have come to take the place of institutions \"because of their power to structure behavior, influence preferences, guide consumption, produce content, signal quality, and sway commodification.\"32</p><p>The state itself can be read as an algorithmic assemblage, a complex web of technical actors, autonomous technologies and layers of data coming together to prevail over the ostensible fallibility and inefficiency of human intent. Data in this equation is not merely a source of knowledge, it becomes knowledge itself.33</p><p>Consider, for example, Singapore. First developed to detect bird flu outbreaks, the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning (RAHS) system in Singapore - which pools data from an exhaustive set of private and public databases - has become the primary decision making tool of the state - from immigration policy, economic forecasts, school curriculum to gauging the nation's \"mood\" using Facebook.34 This highly centralised, all encompassing system of surveillance does not find a comprehensive counter in citizen privacy frameworks.35 Chinese social media giant Baidu has partnered with the military on the China Brain project, to create a system of social credit and ranking for citizens based on their social media engagement36 which will mean that the social media activity of citizens can be monitored and surveilled through state sanction and have a direct impact upon their freedoms.</p><p>Notably, welfare decisions are increasingly turned over to data-driven decision making in India, Australia and the US, creating large-scale exclusions in a matter of a single click with punishing consequences for the poor and the marginalised.37 As Ananny notes, algorithms are \"embedded within the sociotechnical structures; they are shaped by communities of practice, embodied in standards, and most visible when they fail.\"38</p><p>Global data regimes, whether state led databases such as the RAHS, or privately held by platform corporations are the latest in a line of systems that citizens do not get to vote for, but which end up shaping the significant policies that affect their lives. Global data partnerships have thus seen the large-scale infiltration of data capitalists into hitherto public systems. As a result of this, public infrastructure becomes reconfigured into privately held data enclaves. This poses serious concerns for public good and citizen accountability.39 Critical sectors such as education have metamorphosed into covert sites of data mining by programmes. Examples include Google Apps for Education (GAFE)40 and Pearson's Learning Curve for large-scale modelling and predictive analytics,41 both of which pose new ethical challenges to institutional practices. This shift is also visible in health care, with ambitious \"smart medicine\" projects such as IBM's Watson.42</p><p>As data enabled decision making becomes normalised within public services and governance systems, it promotes a centralisation of authority and power. Facts are selectively mobilised to position political intent as techno-managerial objectivity, while local discretion and flexibility to deal with contextual claims of marginal citizens is eliminated.43 In India, for instance, machine-based decision making on entitlements on the basis of data sets that were incorrect, resulted in the large exclusions of people from welfare benefits. While hiccups in any system are to be anticipated, what made the issue untenable in this case was the fact that no recourse to technological failure or glitches were factored in, leaving citizens, many of them critically dependent on the schemes, disenfranchised on the basis of a completely automated decision, working on flawed data. Algorithmic welfare management, referring here to the practice of deploying technological and data based solutions to process and approve entitlements, uses the myth of the sanctity of data - positing it as a necessary and unfailing means to plug leakages and redeem democracy from undeserving citizens free riding on public resources.44</p><p>Sofar as the evidence goes, the algorithmic turn in democracy, the manifestations of which have been discussed in earlier sections, is embedded in the rise of global to local structures of authoritarian capitalism, geared to preserve a neo-liberal consensus even if local interests are at peril.45 Fragmenting societies insidiously, disenfranchising marginal citizens systematically, and generating political distractions relentlessly, the technological assemblages based on data and digital intelligence present immense and urgent challenges for the future of human societies.</p><p>The legitimacy of the algorithmic turn has been aided by a meta narrative of technomodernity that all nations must embrace. Cast as neutral tools of economic progress and social advancement, digital technologies have acquired an aura of ungovernability. Big tech corporations often present AI tools that learn and adapt rapidly as an autonomous force far too complex to be understood completely. However, in a rapidly unfolding datafied world, the integration of digital intelligence needs to be rooted in frameworks of accountability, where social intent guides the appropriation of technology</p><p>3? Watching the watchmen - need for new frameworks</p><p>In light of recent events and developments emanating from the Frankenstein Internet of today, digital corporations have come out with public statements about better standards and industry norms for privacy. Google has revealed a set of AI principles - that will ostensibly \"take into account a broad range of social and economic factors, and.. .proceed where (Google) believe(s) that the overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.\"46 The principles, coming as they are in response to public pressure and discontent of employees, may seem like a good first step, but whether the company is upholding its ethical commitment or not will be based on Google's own assessment.47 Platform companies such as Facebook48 have also committed to developing ethical standards and AI and design based solutions for countering the above discussed problems of runaway technology. Bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) are actively working to develop standards and guidelines for ethical AI.49 While this is a welcome move, the democratic project in this moment of flux needs an overhaul of institutional norms and cultures. Deliberating and debating the ethics that are adequate to the twenty first century techno-paradigm needs to be followed by non-negotiable and preeminent steps to translate ethical reflections into clear norms and institutional frameworks and oversight.</p><p>For one, the public sphere today is in immediate need of fortification against the disruptions of big capital and technology if we are to correct the derailment of democratic processes. Policies that can effectively govern misinformation and social engineering are needed to ensure that the spirit of deliberation and political engagement is preserved. Some countries such as Malaysia,50 Ireland51 and Germany52 have responded to this crisis with legislation that can counter the spread of fake news and platform misuse through punitive measures. Others such as the US are pushing for greater transparency on online political advertisements with proposed legislation such as The Honest Ads Act.53 The wave of proposed regulation and legislation is a welcome sign that countries have woken up to see the writing on the wall. However, the fine line where platform vigilance can easily turn into institutional censorship will be the slippery slope one needs to watch out for.</p><p>There is thus, a slow but growing consensus that solutions are needed, in ways that enrich citizens' social capital rather than infringe on their rights. Critical thinking and discerning consumption of meaningful content, in a technoscape full of falsehoods remains an important challenge and policies that advocate critical media and digital literacy in schools and institutions in this context will be a positive move.54</p><p>Policymaking must move from being reactive to actively future-proofing democracy against the autocratic tendencies and function creep of datafication and algorithmic governance. In the absence of clearly articulated norms and policies, algorithmic assemblages, being integrated rapidly into governance frameworks today, risk becoming stand-ins for policy.</p><p>Algorithms are limited when it comes to exhibiting nuance, negotiating trade-offs, or exercising the necessary discretion when needed.55 This lack of flexibility completely evacuates citizen rights to meaningful representation and participation. As an important building block of democracy in the digital age, digital intelligence needs to be imagined, calibrated, tested and recalibrated recursively through the prism of citizen rights within institutional frameworks of transparency and accountability.</p><p>We therefore need sound and well developed \"technological due process\"56 that can ensure fairness and preserve the domain of participatory rule making. The right to peer into the algorithmic black box, demand explanations and challenge automated decision making are critical to realise the right to be heard in the context of digitalised governance. The Right to Explanation in the EU General Data Protection &amp; Regulation57 and the City of New York's decision to put in place a task force to examine \"automated decision systems\" in public administration are some positive moves in this direction.58 Furthermore, algorithmic accountability needs to be complemented with strong data protection frameworks that protect citizen rights, allow them control over their data and prevent unethical and unscrupulous data driven techniques and profiteering. Policies must strike the right balance between the concern for individual privacy-personal data and considerations of data as a collective good-having public value. This means some dimensions of data and digital intelligence are treated like public resources and subject to appropriate public oversight. This is non-negotiable if data driven governance is to truly reflect democratic intent, foster inclusive development and guarantee citizen rights.</p><p>Ultimately, it is human intent that determines the democratic design or lack thereof in any given technology.59 Digital intelligence and algorithmic assemblages can surveil, disenfranchise or discriminate, not because of objective metrics, but because they have not been subject to the necessary institutional oversight that underpins the realisation of socio-cultural ideals in contemporary democracies.

John McCain </nameText></person>for stepping up to co-sponsor the Honest Ads Act, which would force Facebook, Googleand other online companies to play by the same rules as older media, and disclose who's paying for political advertising. </p><p>  The bill's Democratic sponsors, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Mark Warner (Va.), are motivated by fury in their party over Russian meddling in an election that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>lost. But in reality, this is about far more than stopping foreign interference in US politics. </p><p>  Back when today's disclosure rules were written in 2002, Internet ads weren't a factor. Now they are: Indeed, Trump campaign guru <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway </nameText></person>cites the Clinton team's ineptness with them as a key to the outcome. </p><p>  More than $1 billion-with-a-b went for digital political ads last year, and the figure is sure to soar in the future. It would be insane not to demand transparency going forward. </p><p>  Online firms may claim it's particularly hard for them to enforce or execute disclosure - but that's their problem. They reap endless benefits from their no questions asked as long as you've got the cash approach; too bad if it doesn't serve them well here. </p><p>Facebook has actually claimed that figuring out whether an ad is commercial or political is just too challenging. Write some algorithms, folks. Or hire some more live bodies if the robots just can't hack it.  </p><p>  Protecting democracy is more important than a Silicon Valley business model. </p><p>  Big Tech knows it can't continue to fly under the radar here - but its lobbyists are at work looking to minimize the impact of new laws.

It plainly needs to move past its 2006 ruling that these involve \"a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.\" </p><p>  But Congress should act, too - and other Republicans should join McCain in insisting on it.

These companies have gotten into the middle of absolutely everything about our lives at every level, from the way we look at our own family photos to the way we learn anything about our world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, liberals cite strong evidence that these same companies have been manipulated by dark forces \u2014 particularly Russian information warfare units \u2014 to destabilize the United States by promoting a nutty brand of politics that happened to be aligned at the time with conservatives.</p><p>James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, recently stated that he believes Russian-backed operations mounted within our own tech platforms \"threw\" our last presidential election and might make future elections suspect, because we're doing nothing about it. This only adds to the well-established consensus from intelligence agencies that Russia has been using our own Internet companies against us.</p><p>What if critics from the left and the right are both correct? Maybe there is something unsustainably creepy about having a handful of the world's largest corporations right in the middle of all communication between everyone, no matter how intimate, especially when the business plan of these companies depends on manipulating human behavior.</p><p>It's important to understand the nature of the problem. The effects of social media manipulation are slight at any given time. But slight changes applied consistently and carefully can have big effects. An initially minute compound interest can turn into a big reward for a patient investor. In the same way, slight but predictable changes to the behavior of a population can be gained through adaptive algorithmic adjustments to social media experiences.</p><p>The problem is weirdly devilish. It attacks the very mechanisms that ought to protect us. The damage is reminiscent of the way AIDS undoes the immune systems that would normally battle disease. Once elections are made suspect, for instance, then politicians have little choice but to cling to the results that brought them to office. If a politician says, \"I might not have been legitimately elected,\" then that politician is undone, and chaos ensues. There is no way out.</p><p>Former executives and engineers of conscience \u2014 from companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 have admitted and apologized for deliberately creating addictive and manipulative designs. Everything is out in the open, and yet the threat has a design that prevents us from responding. We feel helpless and just sit there, watching our world become fake and dark.</p><p>It's not just politics. The onset of new media use on smartphones coincided with a rise in teen suicide of almost a third. This is a stunning level of carnage. Usually, parents would not take no for an answer when it comes to protecting kids. Think about Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The problem this time is that the parents are also addicted to social media. Most people are. It's easier to talk about those people over there who are addicted to opioids, alcohol, gambling, or some other seemingly exotic disorder than it is to face one's own addictions. Once again, the disease attacks the very forces that should defend against it, so that we are all left in an absurd state of disability.</p><p>Maybe the moral courage of Silicon Valley engineers will save us. More and more of the most valuable and talented individuals are starting to demand that the big tech companies change their ways. There was recently a wave of resignations in protest of some of Google's latest work, in this case extending personal surveillance techniques to drones.</p><p>Maybe the European Union will save us. The new privacy rules that just came into effect \u2014 the General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 might turn out to force the companies into better business practices. There were complaints lodged on the first day of the GDPR that Google and Facebook were forcing users to agree to the full barrage of surveillance and manipulation in exchange for using the companies' services at all. We will see how those legal challenges evolve. But the project of European unity has already been weakened by social media addiction and manipulation. Information warfare waged through American tech platforms targeted the Brexit vote and boosted the rise of populist parties.</p><p>If Americans wish to live in a world that doesn't feel increasingly dark and absurd, like a \"Black Mirror\" episode, then we must regain the characteristic that has always saved America in the past: individual identity, courage, and self-determination.</p><p>We cannot just lament, complain, and whine. We must act, and there are not too many options for action available. Since the platforms run by the very companies at the heart of the problem \u2014 like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others that have proved themselves vulnerable to abuses by entities like Russian psych warfare units \u2014 are also the places where people currently lament, complain, and whine, those activities are profoundly useless, more than ever.</p><p>There is one clear, concrete thing you can do to refuse to participate in the destruction of our beloved country. Delete your social media accounts.</p><p>It's hard to break an addiction. You'll tell yourself stories about why you don't need to do it, and those stories will be reinforced by other people with similar addictions, including many well-meaning people of influence. They'll tell you that if you succeed, you're only being unfair to those who can't follow you. You'll be told you're privileged, or selfish, or silly.</p><p>If you find that you can't quit, that your dependence is winning, whether for emotional, personal, or professional reasons .\u00a0.\u00a0. if you find that you are absolutely compelled to agree to accept sneaky and abusive schemes, as described by some of the top people who created them, if that is what it comes to, then you must demand a cessation of these schemes as the top priority for our nation.</p><p>If we cannot trust our own elections, enjoy our own family bonds without manipulative intervention, or learn about our world without the fear of psych warfare, then our nation is as good as dead.</p><p>All other causes are lost if this cause is lost. This isn't someone else's addiction. This is your addiction, right here, right now. Deal with it or forget about the America you love.</p><p>Jaron Lanier is a computer scientist, musician, and writer. His latest book is \"Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-7b6c71a8-6a5e-11e8-be05-6785e77d7d69</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH9-D171-JC2G-C0JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1130\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 8, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

Heard,Special to Gulf News,Thinker</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whoosh. There goes \u00a3100 billion (Dh477.4 billion). With one mighty slosh in the frothing sea of international markets, Facebook stock lost a fifth of its value in a few hours last week, making for the biggest US stock-market loss ever seen in a single day. It's not been the best year for the tech giant. It has been panned by politicians and activists for allowing its platform to become a propaganda arm for malign forces from Russia to Daesh (the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), for funnelling user data into unscrupulous hands and for driving us all crazy with social media addiction. Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been hauled in to testify at length before the US Congress, and has riled European political opposition by his derisive refusal to do the same here.</p><p>The need to police his enormous website is starting to cost Zuckerberg more money. But more importantly, users seem to be getting a bit bored with it. They are clicking less on its links, seem less moved by its adverts and, In the developed world, the number of its users is getting to saturation point. Facebook is still a ginormous beast, of course, reaching 2.2 billion people and counting each month, but investors have realised the breakneck expansion pace can't continue. It's easy to get fixated on the misdeeds of a particular company and cheer its misfortunes. Facebook is hard to like. But the truth is that we are just at the start of the data age it represents. Our current attempts to rein in its excesses are likely to prove wholly inadequate; the global flow of data will turn economies upside down and challenge the very idea of the state. Facebook's fortunes can shoot up and down in the blink of an eye, but even when it does decline and fail, the problems it's creating will only spring up anew.</p><p>Take the EU's first major data regulation, GDPR. Most of us will know it only from the flurry of emails we all received a few months ago, asking us to sign back up to company email lists. These emails were, incidentally, not actually required by the legislation, but few businesses seemed able to discern what it did require. That's because GDPR is an analogue regulation for a digital world. It tries to establish the right principles, but modern tech is a slippery beast and our current regulatory methods certainly aren't up to the task of policing it. One small example illustrates why. GDPR tries to enhance users' rights over personal data rather than deeming it the sole property of the organisation that collects it. So one of its provisions is that, if a person demands it, a company must delete the personal data it holds on her. This sounds simple, but it isn't.</p><p>\"Delete\" isn't a binary term in IT. It could mean anything from making the data unavailable and hard to access, writing over it eight times, or shredding the physical disc on which it's stored. It's also extremely difficult for a company to be sure it's managed to \"delete\" every copy it might have. Logging into a company's Wi-Fi and buying one of its products could involve storing your details in three places, for example, in databases that are probably not automatically linked or indexed. That's before we even get to the definition of \"personal data\", which is not always clear. In other words, this very reasonable-sounding law is extremely difficult to obey and almost certainly unenforceable.</p><p>Murky accountability</p><p>Then there's the problem of jurisdiction. Increasingly, data is being stored on the cloud- networked servers that users can access from anywhere. Governments increasingly want to know and make laws on where the data is stored so that they can apply rules to it on usage or access by law enforcement. Unfortunately for them, within a cloud, data moves around political jurisdictions seamlessly and unnoticeably. It can be in several places at once or might appear to be unavailable when in fact it still exists somewhere. This ephemeral quality belies the fact that data is becoming one of mankind's most valuable resources. If a company started shipping gold bars back and forth between countries, states would probably notice and start to tax them. This ability to have a territory and levy taxes is, in fact, one of the oldest and most defining characteristics of a government. But now it's easy to ship a treasure trove of data from one side of the planet to the other without a single interaction with any authorities.</p><p>This is both exciting and terrifying. It potentially opens up a world of freedom our ancestors could never have imagined, in which humans form their own associations, businesses or relationships across previously unsurmountable boundaries. We can exchange information unfettered, escape censorious or paternalistic authorities and create entirely new forms of association and ideas for living. Unfortunately, history teaches that liberating technology always uncovers the evil alongside the good and creative in humanity. Extremist ideologies can flow across the world just as easily as new sewing designs. Making criminals and states accountable for their actions is becoming increasingly murky and difficult. And the primacy of digital interactions is crowding out real life, geographical ties and richer emotional experiences.</p><p>Even more alarming is the prospect of how this will transform governments. It's entirely possible that in the future, the only way for governments to exercise the normal functions of a state that we now take for granted will be to build centralised, authoritarian databases and surveillance mechanisms. The archetype for this is, of course, China. Beijing is the only modern authority able to police the internet. It deploys a variety of tools, from making online anonymity illegal to cutting itself off from all external influences and introducing a new \"social credit\" system, in which every online user is rated depending on various behaviours, such as the prompt repayment of debts, the number of hours they spend playing computer games or the \"quality\" of their social media posts.</p><p>Compared with this nightmarish vision, Facebook looks almost benign.

There goes \u00a3100 billion. With one mighty slosh in the frothing sea of international markets, Facebook stock lost a fifth of its value in a few hours this week, making for the biggest US stock-market loss ever seen in a single day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not been the best year for the tech giant. It has been panned by politicians and activists for allowing its platform to become a propaganda arm for malign forces from Russia to Isil, for funnelling user data into unscrupulous hands and for driving us all crazy with social media addiction. Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been hauled in to testify at length before the US Congress, and has riled European political opposition by his derisive refusal to do the same here.</p><p>The need to police his enormous website is starting to cost Mr Zuckerberg more money. But more importantly, users seem to be getting a bit bored with it. They are clicking less on its links, seem less moved by its adverts and, in the developed world, the number of its users is getting to saturation point. Facebook is still a ginormous beast, of course, reaching 2.2 billion people and counting each month, but investors have realised the breakneck expansion pace can't continue.</p><p>It's easy to get fixated on the misdeeds of a particular company and cheer its misfortunes. God knows, Facebook is hard to like. But the truth is that we are just at the start of the data age it represents. Our current attempts to rein in its excesses are likely to prove wholly inadequate; the global flow of data will turn economies upside down and challenge the very idea of the state. Facebook's fortunes can shoot up and down in the blink of an eye, but even when it does decline and fail, the problems it's creating will only spring up anew.</p><p>Take the EU's first major data regulation, GDPR. Most of us will know it only from the flurry of emails we all received a few months ago, asking us to sign back up to company email lists. These emails were, incidentally, not actually required by the legislation, but few businesses seemed able to discern what it did require. That's because GDPR is an analogue regulation for a digital world. It tries to establish the right principles, but modern tech is a slippery beast and our current regulatory methods certainly aren't up to the task of policing it.</p><p>One small example illustrates why. GDPR tries to enhance users' rights over personal data rather than deeming it the sole property of the organisation that collects it. So one of its provisions is that, if a person demands it, a company must delete the personal data it holds on her. This sounds simple, but it isn't.</p><p>\"Delete\" isn't a binary term in IT. It could mean anything from making the data unavailable and hard to access, writing over it eight times, or shredding the physical disc on which it's stored. It's also extremely difficult for a company to be sure it's managed to \"delete\" every copy it might have.</p><p>Logging into a company's Wi-Fi and buying one of its products could involve storing your details in three places, for example, in databases that are probably not automatically linked or indexed. That's before we even get to the definition of \"personal data\", which is not always clear.</p><p>In other words, this very reasonable-sounding law is extremely difficult to obey and almost certainly unenforceable.</p><p>Then there's the problem of jurisdiction. Increasingly, data is being stored on the cloud - networked servers that users can access from anywhere. Governments increasingly want to know and make laws on where the data is stored so that they can apply rules to it on usage or access by law enforcement. Unfortunately for them, within a cloud, data moves around political jurisdictions seamlessly and unnoticeably. It can be in several places at once or might appear to be unavailable when in fact it still exists somewhere.</p><p>This ephemeral quality belies the fact that data is becoming one of mankind's most valuable resources. If a company started shipping gold bars back and forth between countries, states would probably notice and start to tax them. This ability to have a territory and levy taxes is, in fact, one of the oldest and most defining characteristics of a government. But now it's easy to ship a treasure trove of data from one side of the planet to the other without a single interaction with any authorities.</p><p>This is both exciting and terrifying. It potentially opens up a world of freedom our ancestors could never have imagined, in which humans form their own associations, businesses or relationships across previously unsurmountable boundaries. We can exchange information unfettered, escape censorious or paternalistic authorities and create entirely new forms of association and ideas for living.</p><p>Unfortunately, history teaches that liberating technology always uncovers the evil alongside the good and creative in humanity. Extremist ideologies can flow across the world just as easily as new sewing designs. Making criminals and states accountable for their actions is becoming increasingly murky and difficult. And the primacy of digital interactions is crowding out real life, geographical ties and richer emotional experiences.</p><p>Even more alarming is the prospect of how this will transform governments. It's entirely possible that in the future, the only way for governments to exercise the normal functions of a state that we now take for granted will be to build centralised, authoritarian databases and surveillance mechanisms. The archetype for this is, of course, China.</p><p>Beijing is the only modern authority able to police the internet. It deploys a variety of tools, from making online anonymity illegal to cutting itself off from all external influences and introducing a new \"social credit\" system, in which every online user is rated depending on various behaviours, such as the prompt repayment of debts, the number of hours they spend playing computer games or the \"quality\" of their social media posts.</p><p>Compared with this nightmarish vision, Facebook looks almost benign. It isn't, of course, but nor is it clear what exactly we can do about its most malignant aspects without radically altering our attitude to privacy, freedom and state power. Democratic, liberal values and the nation state have been sorely tested many times in their history. But the coming tech age might be their biggest test yet.</p><p>follow Juliet Samuel on Twitter @CitySamuel; read more at <url

In other words, we should never forget that the existence of the fourth estate is pivotal to any free society, because a genuine democracy is more than simply a system of electoral decision-making. This analysis is the starting point for Victor Pickard's engaging contribution to the debate\u00a0about the crisis in journalism and why the current digital transformation should be a matter of such urgency for all concerned with a free society. One of his previous co-edited volumes (from 2011) was memorably titled Will the Last Reporter Please Turn Out the Lights, so he is well versed in the pressures faced by the news media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pickard\u00a0describes the perfect storm of declining print sales, deteriorating prospects for newsroom staff and vanishing advertising sales, in a world where the global technology platforms have overturned the traditional business models of news production and consumption. From there, he gives a grim picture of the consequences of these shifts on journalism's ability to hold power to account, especially in the emerging \"news deserts\", areas where regional and local press have pretty much evaporated.</p><p>There is a particularly prescient account of the ever-closer intersection of journalism and public relations, highlighting the blurred boundaries and inevitable ethical dilemmas created by \"native advertising\" (which blends in so well that readers may not realise it has been paid for) and \"branded content\". Reliance on these represents one of several funding models that news media have clung to in an increasingly tricky world, and the book critiques it alongside the familiar options of wealthy owners, paywalls, philanthropy, membership fees and so\u00a0on.</p><p>But\u00a0amid this\u00a0search for viable business models, Pickard's key message is that none of these alternatives can adequately support a functioning democracy, which ultimately requires a well-supported and resourced public media sector. He\u00a0writes very much from a US perspective, where such models have never made more than a marginal appearance. Watching\u00a0the on-air fundraising appeals on US public television channels, with the hosts begging\u00a0viewers\u00a0to send in donations, can make a foreigner cringe.</p><p>It is interesting to discover that this was not an inevitable trajectory and that the current US system resulted from a series of missed opportunities. As a prelude to the Public Broadcasting Act in 1967, the Carnegie Commission had crucially recommended that public television be funded by a duty on TV sets (similar to the BBC licence fee). It warned that reliance on congressional appropriations meant inevitable vulnerability to political whim. Alas, this was not translated into the legislation.</p><p>Despite the US focus, Pickard's persuasive case for the value of publicly funded news media rings loud bells in the current UK media environment, where the BBC is about to fight for its future as an institution\u00a0supported by a universal licence fee. There is also the global question of how big tech companies, having decimated the advertising, should contribute to newsgathering and to a responsible society generally. Here again, Pickard offers a somewhat gloomy analysis, although it does now appear that the tide against big tech companies is at last turning. Certainly in Europe, the appetite for meaningful regulation combined with appropriate taxation is growing\u00a0- giving at least some scope for the much-needed reinvention of news media.</p><p>Suzanne Franks is professor of journalism at City, University of London.</p><p>Democracy without Journalism?

So is Bernie, and maybe Biden. Primaries to pick 2020 presidential candidates are more than a year away in most parts of the United States, but candidates seeking the highest office in the land are making their intentions known now, and almost every candidate running for the Democratic nomination to take on Donald Trump is making sure people know where they stand on AI. Artificial intelligence isn't a part of every candidate's official campaign platform, but a point of view on the impact of intelligent machines appears to be essential for candidates in 2020 \u2014 a requirement that didn't exist in 2012 or 2016. Candidates may tackle the subject of algorithms or artificial intelligence head on or come at it indirectly, as machine intelligence underlies a number of topics important to the future of the nation, including economic mobility, income equality, national defense, and the future of work. Outrage over the misuse of AI systems also gives candidates an opportunity to exhibit rage on behalf of the common person or touch on ambitious plans for the future. It could even allow them to tap into a new kind of populism, as the technology is expected to increase income inequality and eliminate millions of jobs the world over \u2014 a trend that is expected to accelerate as many more companies adopt AI systems[1]. Their stances may also be influenced by the techlash of the past year, and monopolies controlled by companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon that Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren says should be broken up[2]. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders, who came in second in primary victories in 2016 behind Hillary Clinton, may have been the first major candidate to make AI part of his campaign platform. In a video to announce his 2020 presidential bid last month[3], Bernie Sanders said, 'I'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology.' He would elaborate during a CNN Town Hall[4]. 'I am very worried about artificial intelligence and robotics and what it will mean to working people in this country. We need to have a long discussion to make certain that millions of workers are not thrown out on the street because of robotics. Technology is a good thing, but it has to be a good thing for workers and not just the people who own that technology. All right? And the Trump people believe that, as well,' Sanders said. Other major candidates have sponsored legislation to combat the negative impacts of AI ahead of introducing their presidential campaigns. Last June, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who is still exploring a presidential bid, sponsored legislation[5] to provide financial support to people who lost jobs due to automation. Senators Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts each signed letters last fall[6] demanding federal agencies that regulate job discrimination and economic opportunity, as well as the FBI, address questions related to facial recognition software and algorithmic bias. Shortly thereafter, Harris and a bipartisan group of senators introduced the AI in Government Act[7] to coordinate cooperation among federal agencies, establish an AI advisory council, and expand an office that advises federal agencies on technical matters. None of the aforementioned pieces of legislation were passed by Congress and enshrined into law, but they send strong signals about the sorts of stances that can be expected during the coming campaign season. SUBHEAD? AI was made a topic of discussion early on by Andrew Yang and Rep. John Delaney, candidates who started their campaigns last year with AI as a focal point. Delaney is the creator of the House AI Caucus \u2014 yes, that's a thing \u2014 and left his position as Congressman for Maryland's 6th District to run for president. Speaking at SXSW earlier this week, Delaney called AI the most important topic to talk about, and, disregarding Trump's American AI Initiative[8], said the United States needs a national AI strategy just like European nations and China. 'So our national AI strategy should focus on work, it should focus on national security, because that's really our threats going forward. It should focus on privacy. Right?' Delaney said during a CNN Town Hall[9]. 'And it should also focus on programming bias, meaning the machines that people are coming up with now, these miraculous machines, they're going to make all the decisions that human beings have historically made. And we've had a hard time getting the bias out of our human-based society. I worry it's going to be programmed into all the machines.' His comments this week echo op-eds he wrote in Techcrunch and Wired on the subject in roughly the past year. With the slogan 'Humanity First,' Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, believes the United States is at the start of the 'greatest economic transformation in the history of the country.' Yang understood before other candidates that no matter whether you believe AI will result in a net gain or a net loss of jobs, millions of people will have to consider job relocation as a result of intelligent machines, and they're going to need help. Calls for a universal basic income of $1,000 for every adult 18-64 have also attracted attention. Predicting what happens next in a U.S. presidential race is a dicey game, especially after 2016 when Donald Trump won and even he seemed surprised, but you don't need a crystal ball or political analyst to spell this out: Whether it's the AI arms race with adversaries like China and Russia, our national AI strategy or lack thereof, algorithmic bias, the use of facial recognition software by law enforcement, job retraining programs, calls for regulation of big tech, or talk of 'dignity of work,' it seems certain AI will be a major issue of presidential campaigns in 2020, particularly on the Democratic side. What's much less clear is how sustained attention from politicians in a crowded field of candidates and treatment of artificial intelligence as a populist punching bag will leave us better off than we are now.

Moderates such as Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden are also looking at aggressive measures to curtail the power of companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Google.</p><p>Arguments that were once confined to leftwing fringes are being examined more closely by government officials as well. Last week the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces competition laws, said it would review every takeover by a large technology company of a smaller start-up in the past decade to see whether they had displayed anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p>For decades, regulators had resisted taking action against companies on competition grounds unless consumers were being harmed through rising prices. </p><p>But for the past few years, a small group of leftwing academics has argued that large technology companies are causing damage in other ways, such as by killing off smaller competitors and eroding data privacy.</p><p>This group is close to one candidate in particular: Ms Warren. </p><p>\u201cCompetition is dying,\u201d the senator said in a speech that first laid out her ideas on tech antitrust in 2016. \u201cConsolidation and concentration are on the rise in sector after sector. Concentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy.\u201d</p><p>Through her advocacy, their ideas are now gaining a wide hearing in the 2020 presidential race. \u201cWhat Warren is channelling is a variation of antitrust that the progressive left has managed to resurrect over the past five years,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which is funded in part by large tech companies.</p><p>Ms Warren\u2019s 2016 speech, which has now become famous in legal and technology circles, was written after a series of informal policy seminars with Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Institute, and a handful of other like-minded academics and lawyers who have become her brains trust on tech policy. </p><p>\u201cThis was the most important speech by a major public figure about the dangerous concentration in the United States since probably the 1930s,\u201d said Mr Lynn. \u201cThere was no recognition of the problem, and then there was that speech that highlighted the problem in a way that people could not ignore it.\u201d</p><p>Who is behind the progressive rethink on tech?</p><p>Barry Lynn</p><p> director, <br/>Open Markets Institute</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role:</emphasis> Founding father <br/>Founder of the Open Markets Institute, where he has earned a reputation as a thorn in the side of Big Tech</p><p>Lina Khan </p><p>counsel, <br/>House antitrust subcommittee</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role:</emphasis> Academic wunderkind <br/>Still in her early thirties, Ms Khan\u2019s career has already taken her to a key role on the US House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee</p><p>Ganesh Sitaraman </p><p>law professor, <br/>Vanderbilt University</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role:</emphasis> Convener <br/>An informal policy adviser to Ms Warren and an important link between her and the academic community. He is well connected in Democratic circles \u2014 he was a groomsman for Pete Buttigieg, another leading presidential candidate. </p><p>Rohit Chopra</p><p>commissioner, <br/>Federal Trade Commission</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role: </emphasis>Enforcer <br/>Mr Chopra worked with Ms Warren to help set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. He has been a vocal critic of Big Tech since joining the FTC.</p><p>Lina Khan, who published a seminal paper in 2017 while still in law school, is another member of the group. She has argued that Amazon is too powerful and should be investigated for monopoly violations. Critics have latched on to her youth, branding the movement she has come to represent as \u201chipster antitrust\u201d.</p><p>Ms Khan has also advised the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee, which is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of corporate power in the technology sector.</p><p>Ganesh Sitaraman, a professor at Vanderbilt University, has acted as formal and informal policy adviser to Ms Warren since 2012. Those close to Ms Warren say Mr Sitaraman was influential in getting her to see that the arguments she was making about the need to curb the power of big banks also applied to technology companies.</p><p>Democratically aligned antitrust enforcers are also on board. Rohit Chopra, one of the Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, has argued against the corporate power built by the likes of Facebook. Democratic strategists say he is a likely candidate to take over the FTC should a progressive candidate win the presidency.</p><p>In his July 2019 judgment on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data of Facebook users were harvested and used for political campaigning without their consent, Mr Chopra echoed many of the arguments advanced by Mr Lynn and Ms Khan. \u201cThe case against Facebook is about more than just privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also about the power to control and manipulate.\u201d</p><p>Ms Warren\u2019s campaign is looking for a fresh burst of momentum following disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire. But even if she fails in her ambition to become president, her approach to tech antitrust has already taken hold.</p><p>Ms Klobuchar, the moderate who outperformed expectations in New Hampshire, has argued for greater scrutiny of tech megamergers, while Mr Biden says he wants social media companies to be liable for the content posted by third parties on their platforms.</p><p>Only Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, stands apart as a staunch defender of Silicon Valley. \u201cBreaking things up just to be nasty is not an answer,\u201d he said last month.</p><p>Despite Mr Bloomberg\u2019s opposition, many in the Democratic party think the consensus on Big Tech has now changed for good.</p><p>\u201cThere were a small number of us that were talking about this type of thing, and our views were seen as somewhat far-fetched,\u201d said one Warren adviser. \u201cI really think she transformed the debate in a way that nobody has.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-acfceb66469511eaaee29ddbdc86190d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7B-2N11-DXP9-938F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1033\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

More than half a dozen candidates showed up in Austin, Texas, over the weekend for the annual music, arts and technology convention. And Democrats seem to be competing with one another to be the tough-on-tech candidate. Here's more from NPR's Aarti Shahani.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)                </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN:                 Thank you very much. Thank you.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Hundreds of fans in the Moody Theater cheered as Senator Elizabeth Warren hopped on stage. She'd just rallied in Queens, N.Y., where Amazon pulled its plan to build a new headquarters in the face of protest. And now, at a conference full of tech workers, she came with the same message - big tech is killing competition, and that's bad.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)                </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN:                 We want to keep that marketplace competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage and a manipulative advantage be able to snuff you out.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Her new policy position - break up the tech giants. Amazon is exhibit one. It's the popular site for shopping. And it also makes bed frames, yoga mats - a growing list. Warren says you can't run the marketplace and make the goods. That's too much power in too few hands. While consumers benefit from low prices, she says small businesses are losing. If she's president, the losers will change.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)                </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN:                 The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits. Boo hoo.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 After years of scandal - privacy violations, election interference, mega hacks - Silicon Valley has emerged, early on, as a presidential campaign issue. Warren's call is pushing her party to the left, a place where many Democrats aren't ready to go given the party's reliance on tech donors.             </p><p>                In the 2018 midterms, tech companies clearly favored Democrats over the GOP. Sixty-nine percent of Amazon money went to Democratic federal campaigns, 79 percent of Facebook money, 83 percent of Alphabet - Google money.             </p><p>SHEILA KRUMHOLZ:                 It's going to be awkward. They're doing a dance.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Sheila Krumholz directs the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance. The dance is this - use populist messages to raise money online, but don't burn bridges with top executives. Senator Kamala Harris, for example, has spent years advocating for stronger data privacy. But her home base is California, and, as strategists say, Silicon Valley is the ATM machine. According to Krumholz, Harris and other candidates are waiting to see whether the leftist message pays off...             </p><p>SHEILA KRUMHOLZ:                 Or whether they take a more moderated approach and that allows them access to money from Silicon Valley.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Another presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar, wants to stand out for her track record taking on Silicon Valley. In 2018, she got checks from powerful tech donors - former Google chairman Eric Schmidt; Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg; and Amazon's top lawyer, David Zapolsky. But she's also led efforts in the Senate, introducing and sponsoring several bills to regulate the industry. And she came to South By with another bold new idea, which she shared with NPR shortly before jumping on stage.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 When they do use your data, there should be some kind of a tax on it.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 In other words, every time Facebook or Google makes ad money by selling access to your eyeballs, make the tech titan pay.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 They're going to scream when they hear this.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 The problem Klobuchar faced here was that her message - to create a new tax and unleash investigations - didn't excite people as much as Warren's blunter call. The Warren speech ended in a mob.             </p><p>JASON:                 Hi, Senator. I'm Jason. I work in tech, and I think you hit the nail right on the head with all of it.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Adoring fans, including a few tech workers, surrounded her to pledge their support and money and ask for selfies.

It was at least Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s third fund-raising trip to the region in the last three months. Senator Cory Booker was making his fourth trip to Silicon Valley to raise money since declaring for president in February. And Kamala Harris, California\u2019s junior senator, was on her sixth tour of the Bay Area fund-raising circuit this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.</url>]</p><p>The Democratic Party\u2019s intensifying alarms about the technology giants\u2019 monopolistic behavior, social media misinformation and lax privacy protections pose an unexpected dilemma for the 2020 field.</p><p>In a contest where purity tests on the left have already propelled leading campaigns to disavow super PACs and reject money from federal lobbyists, is tech money still politically acceptable? And can those who take it still be trusted to rein in the industry\u2019s excesses?</p><p>The progressive base has already soured on Wall Street, fossil fuel and pharmaceutical cash. Silicon Valley had been, until recently, one of the last relatively untainted wellsprings from which to draw campaign contributions. Now, some, particularly on the left, say tech money is suspect, too.</p><p>\u201cMany of the candidates are trying to have it both ways,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party\u2019s progressive wing, who recently called on Democratic political consultants to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">stop representing corporate clients,</url> \u201cbut it will be hard to be taken seriously as strong on this issue when you\u2019re taking money hand over fist from Big Tech.\u201d</p><p>The fraught Democratic balancing act came into sharp relief last weekend.</p><p>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.</url>]</p><p>House Democrats and Ms. Pelosi announced plans for an antitrust investigation into the largest tech companies and Senator Elizabeth Warren <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">posed in front of a San Francisco billboard</url> calling for breaking up Big Tech. Meanwhile, more than a dozen presidential candidates arrived in the city for the state Democratic convention. That was the public side of their trips; many maintained a busy private itinerary of fund-raisers powered in part by the immense wealth of the tech sector.</p><p>Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Harris all had finance events around the Bay Area on Friday (while Mr. Booker zipped to Seattle to raise money at the office of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">Nick Hanauer</url>, a venture capitalist and early Amazon investor.) Mr. Buttigieg blitzed the region on Saturday, attending an event co-hosted by Chris Cox, Facebook\u2019s former chief product officer and one of its initial engineers, and Scott Kohler, a corporate counsel to Google and former bundler for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Booker returned for an event at the home of Jeff Jordan, a tech investor who had previously served as president of PayPal and OpenTable.</p><p>Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was not in California over the weekend. But his finance team is tentatively planning a Silicon Valley swing at the end of June. In May, one of his Southern California event co-hosts was Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive.</p><p>Democrats mostly appear to be banking that the cash raised at such events outweighs any risk of backlash.</p><p>Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Bernie Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, said one reason is that most people still view tech giants \u201cin a favorable light,\u201d even if attitudes are shifting.</p><p>\u201cThey do not see these companies like Big Oil and the pharmaceutical companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction there.\u201d</p><p>But as the Trump administration forges ahead with its own antitrust investigations into Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, the Democratic reliance on tech money could provide President Trump a political opening to depict Democrats as beholden to the technology giants. <br/></p><p>At a forum in San Francisco, the 2020 candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke linked the industry\u2019s money to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">a law signed by Mr. Trump</url> allowing internet providers access to sell browsing data without explicit consumer consent. \u201cIf you follow the dollars, who paid for that access, that influence, and those outcomes, you begin to understand what\u2019s at play,\u201d he said.</p><p>Most of the 2020 Democrats are aligned on stiffening regulations and tech industry scrutiny.</p><p>But Ms. Warren, in particular, has gone much further, accusing companies like Amazon of improperly controlling the online marketplace and the items sold in it. She has shunned holding fund-raisers as a presidential candidate, though she has raised money from Silicon Valley in the past.</p><p>Ms. Warren has surpassed Senator Bernie Sanders as tech\u2019s most insistent critic (he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer\">recently embraced</url>breaking up Facebook, and he has hammered Amazon for its low wages).</p><p>Ro Khanna, a California congressman who represents and has raised money heavily from Silicon Valley, serves as national co-chair of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, though he is not fully aligned with Mr. Sanders on tech matters. Mr. Khanna said \u201ccalling for a sledgehammer approach\u201d to breaking up Big Tech was \u201cbad policy\u201d when a \u201cscalpel\u201d is needed.</p><p>\u201cPeople should, in my view, be proud of having support from technology leaders,\u201d Mr. Khanna said.</p><p>Silicon Valley is not monolithic. Some companies profit from user data. Some make money selling hardware. Others hope to break into markets now dominated by the giants.

It was at least Mr. Buttigieg's third fund-raising trip to the region in the last three months. Senator Cory Booker was making his fourth trip to Silicon Valley to raise money since declaring for president in February. And Kamala Harris, California's junior senator, was on her sixth tour of the Bay Area fund-raising circuit this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]</p><p>The Democratic Party's intensifying alarms about the technology giants' monopolistic behavior, social media misinformation and lax privacy protections pose an unexpected dilemma for the 2020 field.</p><p>In a contest where purity tests on the left have already propelled leading campaigns to disavow super PACs and reject money from federal lobbyists, is tech money still politically acceptable? And can those who take it still be trusted to rein in the industry's excesses?</p><p>The progressive base has already soured on Wall Street, fossil fuel and pharmaceutical cash. Silicon Valley had been, until recently, one of the last relatively untainted wellsprings from which to draw campaign contributions. Now, some, particularly on the left, say tech money is suspect, too.</p><p>\"Many of the candidates are trying to have it both ways,\" said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party's progressive wing, who recently called on Democratic political consultants to stop representing corporate clients, \"but it will be hard to be taken seriously as strong on this issue when you're taking money hand over fist from Big Tech.\"</p><p>The fraught Democratic balancing act came into sharp relief last weekend.</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.</emphasis>]</p><p>House Democrats and Ms. Pelosi announced plans for an antitrust investigation into the largest tech companies and Senator Elizabeth Warren posed in front of a San Francisco billboard calling for breaking up Big Tech. Meanwhile, more than a dozen presidential candidates arrived in the city for the state Democratic convention. That was the public side of their trips; many maintained a busy private itinerary of fund-raisers powered in part by the immense wealth of the tech sector.</p><p>Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Harris all had finance events around the Bay Area on Friday (while Mr. Booker zipped to Seattle to raise money at the office of Nick Hanauer, a venture capitalist and early Amazon investor.) Mr. Buttigieg blitzed the region on Saturday, attending an event co-hosted by Chris Cox, Facebook's former chief product officer and one of its initial engineers, and Scott Kohler, a corporate counsel to Google and former bundler for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Booker returned for an event at the home of Jeff Jordan, a tech investor who had previously served as president of PayPal and OpenTable.</p><p>Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was not in California over the weekend. But his finance team is tentatively planning a Silicon Valley swing at the end of June. In May, one of his Southern California event co-hosts was Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive.</p><p>Democrats mostly appear to be banking that the cash raised at such events outweighs any risk of backlash.</p><p>Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Bernie Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, said one reason is that most people still view tech giants \"in a favorable light,\" even if attitudes are shifting.</p><p>\"They do not see these companies like Big Oil and the pharmaceutical companies,\" he said. \"There's a distinction there.\"</p><p>But as the Trump administration forges ahead with its own antitrust investigations into Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, the Democratic reliance on tech money could provide President Trump a political opening to depict Democrats as beholden to the technology giants. </p><p>At a forum in San Francisco, the 2020 candidate Beto O'Rourke linked the industry's money to a law signed by Mr. Trump allowing internet providers access to sell browsing data without explicit consumer consent. \"If you follow the dollars, who paid for that access, that influence, and those outcomes, you begin to understand what's at play,\" he said.</p><p>Most of the 2020 Democrats are aligned on stiffening regulations and tech industry scrutiny.</p><p>But Ms. Warren, in particular, has gone much further, accusing companies like Amazon of improperly controlling the online marketplace and the items sold in it. She has shunned holding fund-raisers as a presidential candidate, though she has raised money from Silicon Valley in the past.</p><p>Ms. Warren has surpassed Senator Bernie Sanders as tech's most insistent critic (he recently embraced breaking up Facebook, and he has hammered Amazon for its low wages).</p><p>Ro Khanna, a California congressman who represents and has raised money heavily from Silicon Valley, serves as national co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign, though he is not fully aligned with Mr. Sanders on tech matters. Mr. Khanna said \"calling for a sledgehammer approach\" to breaking up Big Tech was \"bad policy\" when a \"scalpel\" is needed.</p><p>\"People should, in my view, be proud of having support from technology leaders,\" Mr. Khanna said.</p><p>Silicon Valley is not monolithic. Some companies profit from user data. Some make money selling hardware. Others hope to break into markets now dominated by the giants. While Ms. Warren's unyielding rhetoric has alienated some tech leaders, political donors and executives in Silicon Valley said that there is a surprising sympathy for broader calls to increase oversight of the industry's biggest players.</p><p>\"It's my sense that a lot of people in Silicon Valley think tech has gotten too big, that there's overreach,\" said Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder who recently called for the company's breakup.</p><p>\"There's a sense that people know that mistakes were made, and there's a search for solutions,\" Mr. Hughes added.</p><p>Mr. Hughes has contributed to four Democratic candidates this year: Mr. Booker, Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris.</p><p>Three of the most aggressive candidates chasing Silicon Valley money have been Mr. Booker, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris, according to interviews with donors and event invitations obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>All three have ties to the Valley. Mr. Booker attended Stanford and once was an investor in an internet start-up (another investor, the billionaire LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, recently hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Booker).</p><p>Mr. Booker also worked closely with Mark Zuckerberg when the Facebook founder donated $100 million to revamp Newark schools, an undertaking that got mixed reviews.</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg, who as a Harvard undergraduate was one of Facebook's first several hundred users, attended the university at the same time as Facebook's founders and has quickly cultivated relationships across the Valley.</p><p>Ms. Harris, a Bay Area native, has raised the most of any 2020 candidate in the first quarter from employees of companies in the Internet Association, a lobbying arm of the tech industry in Washington D.C., according to an analysis of federal records.</p><p>Yet all have expressed concerns about Big Tech's dominance.</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg recently went on record in support of Mr. Hughes's call to break up Facebook, saying his old schoolmate had \"made a very convincing case\" about \"these tech companies as monopoly giants.\"</p><p>\"There needs to be tools to deal with that, up to and including preventing or reversing mergers,\" Mr. Buttigieg said in a recent podcast.</p><p>Going back several years, Mr. Booker has questioned the dominance of companies including Google and Amazon. In a recent interview with The Times, Mr. Booker said he was planning to roll out an internet security platform and has deepening concerns about companies \"able to use your data for your profit.\" But when asked about Ms. Warren's demand that big tech firms be broken up, he replied in a recent television appearance, \"That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say.\"</p><p>In the Senate, Ms. Harris aggressively questioned Facebook executives last year, and this year she said on CNN that government officials \"need to take a serious look at breaking up Facebook.\"</p><p>Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Market Institute, who previously worked for the Senate Budget Committee under Mr. Sanders and is a critic of the consolidation of power in the tech industry, said there were differences in the deference that candidates gave to Silicon Valley leaders.</p><p>\"Buttigieg and Harris treat them like they're special,\" Mr. Stoller said. \"Warren treats them as they're just citizens. Booker goes back and forth.\"</p><p>Ali Partovi, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Booker, said he sees no evidence that donors are dissuaded by talk about a crackdown on Big Tech.</p><p>\"I find that people vote and donate in service of their principles and beliefs about what they think is right, not just their self-interest,\" Mr. Partovi said.</p><p>The tech economy remains a crucial source of funds for congressional Democrats, too.</p><p>Later this month, Ms. Pelosi will collect checks at a San Francisco law firm that has represented tech companies, asking for as much as $19,600 to help seven of her vulnerable California colleagues. That same day, her political committee is holding an event at the home of John Thompson, the current chairman of Microsoft and the former chief executive of Symantec.</p><p>The price to chair the luncheon: $50,000.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shane Goldmacher reported from San Francisco and Stephanie Saul from New York.

Both <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bernie Sanders,</emphasis>who won the New Hampshire primary, and fellow progressive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elizabeth Warren,</emphasis>have called for the division of America's great tech companies. Moderate candidates like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden</emphasis> also call for aggressive measures to limit the power of companies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook, Amazon and Google.</emphasis><br/>Government authorities also discuss arguments previously attributed to the left. Last week, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federal Trade Commission,</emphasis>responsible for enforcing competition laws, announced that it would review all start-up purchases made by big tech scramines severing the past decade to see if there was anti-competitive behavior. Regulators had been opposed for decades to take action against companies on competition grounds unless consumers were harmed by rising prices.</p><p><br/><br/>All Democratic candidates, except Bloomberg, are in favor of limiting the power of 'big tech'<br/><br/>But in recent years, a small group of left-wing academics has stated that companies are causing damage in other ways, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">eliminating smaller rivals or eroding </emphasis>data privacy. This group has an affinity with a particular candidate: Warren. \"Competition is dying,\" she said in a speech in 2016 in which she first showed her ideas about technology monopoly.<br/>\"Consolidation and concentration are increasing across all sectors. Concentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy and threatens our democracy.\" His ideas are getting a great reception in the presidential race.<br/>Technology policy<br/>\"What Warren proclaims is a variation of the antitrust message that the progressive left has managed to resurrect in the last five years,\" explained Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which is partly funded because of the great tech companies.<br/>Warren's 2016 speech, which has become famous in legal and technological circles, was written after a series of informal seminars on politics with Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Institute, and a group of like-minded academics and lawyers that have become the mastermind of their technological policy. \"It was the most important speech given by a prominent public figure about the dangerous concentration in America probably since the 1930s,\" Lynn said. \"It was a problem that was not recognized, and then that speech came up, highlighting the problem in a way that people couldn't ignore.\"<br/>Lina Khan, who published an influential paper in 2017 while still in law school, is another member of the group. Khan has stated that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon is too powerful and should be investigated by monopoly.</emphasis> Critics have focused on his youth, labeling the movement he has come to play as a \"hipster antitrust.\" Khan has also advised the House antitrust subcommittee, which is conducting a thorough investigation into corporate power in the technology sector.<br/><br/>\"It was a problem that was not recognized and after Warren's speech people can no longer ignore it\"<br/><br/>Ganesh Sitaraman, aVanderbilt University, has worked as Warren's formal and informal adviser since 2012. Sources close to Warren explain that Sitaraman influenced Sitaraman's understanding that the arguments he made about the need to contain the power of the big banks also applied to technology companies.<br/>Responsible for antitrust compliance aligned with Democratic ideas have also joined the campaign. Rohit Chopra, one of the Democratic Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission, has criticized the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">power acquired by companies such as Facebook.</emphasis> In his July 2019 opinion on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook user data was used without his consent for the political campaign, Chopra echoed many of the arguments advanced by Lynn and Khan. \"The case against Facebook goes beyond privacy,\" he said. \"It also affects the power to control and manipulate.\"<br/>Bloomberg<br/>Warren's campaign seeks momentum after disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire. But even if he fails to make the presidency, his message against the technology monopoly has taken root. Klobuchar, the moderate candidate who exceeded expectations in New Hampshire, has called for greater control of major technology mergers, while Biden wants social media companies to be responsible for content posted by third parties on their platforms. Only<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Michael Bloomberg,</emphasis>the former mayor of New York, distinguishes himself as a staunch defender of Silicon Valley.<br/>But despite Bloomberg's opposition, many in the Democratic Party believe that consensus on big tech has changed. \"We were a few of us talking about this kind of thing, and our opinions were considered crazy,\" said one Warren adviser. \"I really think [Warren] transformed the debate like no one has.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10977472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y91-3SJ1-DY1R-B3WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Another shooting at a nightclub in  Florida.  At least two people have been killed, seventeen others injured.</p><p>Authorities are searching for suspects, we have the latest details coming  up.  A dangerous heat wave ripping half of the country. </p><p>A look at when temperatures will begin to drop coming up.  And then the  deal of the day, Verizon acquiring Yahoo for a value of $4.8 billion.</p><p>Yahoo shares down in the pre-market, what it means for CEO Marissa Mayer's  future coming up. </p><p>Markets moving fractionally this morning, edging higher, take a look at  what we're looking at, at the open. </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open up just about 9 points  this morning, fractional moves.</p><p>Later in the week, a whole host of things that the market will get impacted  from.  Investors will have a lot to digest this week between economic data,  a two-day Fed meeting, a Bank of Japan meeting and a lot of earnings  particularly coming out of the tech sector. </p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are higher, take a look, we are looking at  gains pretty much across the board.  The Dax index in Germany up about 1  percent, leading index there.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, mixed performances as you will see fractional moves,  not too far from where they began the session. </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, and joining me to talk about it  is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Maverick PAC National Co-Chair  Morgan Ortagus and Republican strategist Tony Sayegh.</p><p>Great show so far, you guys. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Lots of fun -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Fun, Maria, thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  It's a crazy start -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot happening -- and it really is just day one. </p><p>SAYEGH:  You know, what's crazy? There is a thunder and rainstorm earlier - - </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes, I know -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Over our pavilion here, and that's the analogy for the Democratic  Convention with the resignation of their chair -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Here on the first day -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The 4 mile, 8-foot high fence that is very Trumparian(ph) if you  will.  So, you know what? A wall is OK when it's to protect Democrats, but  not the American people who don't agree with him politically.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Can you imagine -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They built a wall, that's true.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Maybe just -- can you imagine if a week ago Reince Priebus was  resigning on Monday?</p><p>I mean, it's just -- it's really -- it's -- I don't think this has ever  happened before. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And maybe Debbie Wasserman Schultz won't mock people on Twitter  like she did Reince where she offered -- she was like another chair is in  town in Cleveland last week -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where she essentially mocked him -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  He did -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Came back -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Said it didn't help him here -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it came back to bite her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, all these stories coming up this hour, we have a  can't-miss line up, do stay with us.</p><p>We will be speaking with former astronaut and Gabrielle Giffords' husband  Mark Kelly will join us.</p><p>Plus, former Michigan Governor and senior adviser of a Super PAC backing  Hillary Clinton, Jennifer Granholm is with us this morning.</p><p>And Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney will weigh in, you don't want to  miss a moment of it.  So, do stay with us for a big hour ahead. </p><p>There's in fact this raid for Democrats as the convention kicks off today.   The party chairwoman wish to resign amid an e-mail leak. </p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway, McKelway is live in the Wells Fargo Arena right  now with a preview.  Doug, over to you. </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Actually, we stepped outside now, Maria, because  it stopped raining.  But we have just learned that the keynote speaker at  tonight's opening session of the convention will be Massachusetts Senator  Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>This is a good choice for the Democrats because she may be very effective  in deflecting all the attention from the crisis which has engulfed this  convention. </p><p>She's been an excellent foil to Donald Trump, withstanding his Pocahontas  blows while matching him tweet for tweet and insult for insult.</p><p>So, look for her to fire away at Donald Trump tonight.  That said, the e- mail scandal and the Wasserman Schultz's resignation hangs as thick over  this convention as the Summer humidity. </p><p>Hillary Clinton told \"60 Minutes\" last night that she is no way involved in  this crisis. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  I didn't know anything about  it, and I haven't read any of those.  But I am adamantly opposed to anyone  bringing religion into -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes -- </p><p>CLINTON:  Our political process.  I mean, the constitution says no  religious test.  So, that is just absolutely wrong and unacceptable. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCKELWAY:  It is strange then that the Clinton campaign has announced that  Wasserman Schultz will be brought on board as a \"honorary chairman of the  Clinton campaign.\"</p><p>So, Clinton is not distancing herself from the leader of the organization  that brought on this embarrassment to start with. </p><p>Bernie Sanders however wants nothing to do with her and that is a sentiment  where she has been expressing for a long time. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT:  I asked and demanded Debbie Wasserman  Schultz's resignation many months ago.  I don't think she is qualified to  be the chair of the DNC. </p><p>Not only for these awful e-mails which revealed the prejudice of the DNC,  but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and  young people, and I don't think her leadership style is doing that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Bernie Sanders is also among those speaking tonight, as is  Michelle Obama, and an array of union presidents from the SEIU from ASME  and the American Federation of Teachers.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug, thank you so much, let's take a look at one of  those e-mails in that DNC dump-leak, Wasserman Schultz responding to  Sanders complaint that the party has not been fair to him.</p><p>\"Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party  and has no understanding of what we do.\"</p><p>My next guest is set to speak at the Democratic National Convention,  joining me right now is former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm. </p><p>She is also the senior adviser to Correct the Record; a PAC supporting  Hillary Clinton.  Governor, it's nice to see you. </p><p>JENNIFER GRANHOLM, FORMER MICHIGAN GOVERNOR:  Great to be on -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For joining us.  </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First of, I want to ask you about policy, what we're going to  hear this week from the convention for sure.</p><p>But first, there is speculation that you are going to ultimately take over  and become the head of the Democratic National Committee.  Is that true?</p><p>GRANHOLM:  No, that's news to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  That's news to me, I have not talked with anybody on the  campaign about that.  </p><p>And we've got Donna Brazile who is taking over on an interim basis,  although frankly, she would be sad to list on a long-term basis as well  because everybody loves Donna Brazile.</p><p>There are a lot of good people I'm sure who could do that job.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't want the job? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, I have not talked with anybody about that, it's -- you  know, so, it's just not in my -- is not my -- necessarily in my future. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me ask you this, governor, because you know,  Hillary Clinton has her supporters and -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are loyal supporters.  Donald Trump has his supporters,  and he's got some loyal supporters as well.  Then there's this huge block  of independents.  That's what I want to ask you about today. </p><p>What are you -- what do you think we will hear from this convention next  week, that's actually going to attract those independents? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, I think first of all, she's got to really make this case  about her economic plans affecting in a positive way the lives of real  people. </p><p>And the fact is independents who are not aligned with parties often are  really looking to hear what people are going to do for them. </p><p>And she's got very specific strategies to be able to -- you know, this is a  business network, business show, right? </p><p>To be able to make sure that businesses are able to make the choice to  manufacture advanced products in the United States.</p><p>To be able to support the growth of jobs in the U.S. and the global  economy.  She's got very specific strategies on clean energy and making  sure that those products are made in the U.S. and we're able to export. </p><p>She's got specific strategies on raising people's incomes, so that the  economy does better.  And I think you'll hear about -- I mean, starting  with tonight, tonight is the -- the theme is about children families and  how she help support families. </p><p>But it's really about how she hopes to better individual's economies which  obviously helps families.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this is what I don't understand, and you have to connect  the dots for us.</p><p>Because when you hear some of these policies in terms of what you're saying  right now, it doesn't jive with what you would think actually does increase  economic growth.</p><p>So, I mean, the big issue -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  What do you mean? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I'll tell you right -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now.  Raising wages is going to make it harder for small  business.</p><p>Building on Obamacare is going to make it more expensive for small  business.  Raising taxes on the highest earners is going to  impact small  business. </p><p>How does that lead to economic growth? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, you want to be able to make sure that people have the  ability to buy the products.  And so, making sure that everybody grows,  that we are all in this together.</p><p>That you -- if you -- if you can't even -- if you're making $900 a week  because you are earning a minimum wage, you're bringing home $900 a month,  you know, how can you afford to buy any of the products? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  How can you afford to buy any of the services? So, you want to  make sure that everybody has a chance to succeed.  And she has a total  comprehensive plan on small businesses.</p><p>Making sure they have access to capital, making sure we're supporting small  business growth.  She wants to be the small business president, so, she's  really listened to them about what it would take for them to be able to  succeed. </p><p>She's got -- she knows that there are changes that need to happen within  the Affordable Care Act.  But she also knows that she's not going to put  all of that burden on to businesses like it was in the past where you had  businesses who were picking up the full tap for people's healthcare.  You  want to have a shared responsibility for it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think you make a really good point.  But when we speak  with people like the head of a franchise for McDonald's or the head of a  small business, and we have these guys and girls on a lot.</p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say, look, raising the minimum wage to $15 on a national  level is going to create real pressure for me.  It might put us out of  business, it might put us towards bankruptcy, and yes, we will be cutting  jobs. </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, so, you want to make sure though that people who -- if  you're not making enough money to be even able to afford your rent because  you are making $7 and some change an hour, you're not going to be able to  see those people at McDonald's buying food. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about leaving it to -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The states? I mean, that's what -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Donald Trump said, leave it to the states. </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, he doesn't even want to have a minimum wage at all. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  That's all -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said he's not against raising the wage, but leave it to the  states to -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Yes, but he's also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Decide, because everybody has a different income.</p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, he's also the guy who has said that wages may be too high.   So, honestly, you need to be able to balance it, so that people who are  going to buy your products have the means to be able to do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  And you're responsible in allowing some movement at the state  level.  She has said, obviously, that she'd like to see the states take  these actions.</p><p>But she knows that in recent things are a little bit different. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he did say that he thought $7 was too low actually, is  what Donald Trump said.  But let me ask you this -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, he's not advocating for an increase in it, that's for  sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said leave it to the states, is what he said, leave it to  the -- I asked Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she was favoring Hillary  Clinton.  This was -- this was back in March.  Listen to what she said, I  want to get your reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CHAIRPERSON, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:   There's just no shred of evidence to suggest that I'm favoring Hillary  Clinton. </p><p>I am running -- if I were -- Maria, if I wanted to go -- not doing a very  good job wrapping the nomination up for her if I were actually favoring  Hillary Clinton.  I could have worked a lot harder at it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think these leaked e-mails contradict that statement? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, you know, the question is, are the e-mails from her or are  they from staff members? </p><p>You know, obviously -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  The Democratic National Committee is comprised of a whole lot of  staff members who have relationships on both sides. </p><p>There were some that were against Hillary Clinton, some that were against  Bernie Sanders.  The bottom line is it's the states that decide, it is the  voters in the states who decide it who is going to be the nominee.</p><p>And I don't think any of those e-mails had any impact on the outcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, let me ask you now about the trust factor.</p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know this has been one of the biggest issues -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  For sure -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For Hillary Clinton, right? People say, they don't trust her,  she lied.</p><p>How is she going to change that, you know, perception out -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There? What are we going to hear because one of the things that  people are saying is, we're going to hear who the real Hillary Clinton is  this week. </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, I mean, that is going to be part of the strategy because  there's -- you know, she has this image out there, and the Republicans  certainly just last week spent all of their time hammering her. </p><p>And so that you would think that she is this horrible monster.  People need  to hear from people who know her personally and who have been impacted by  her personally. </p><p>So, you're going to hear a lot of real people who have stories about  Hillary Clinton and how -- what she did helped them out, as well as people  who know her. </p><p>And that's going to start tonight.  They're going to have all these big  names, speaking obviously.  You got Michelle Obama -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Tonight -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's tonight -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  You got Bernie Sanders tonight, you have Cory Booker tonight -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Elizabeth Warren -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Elizabeth Warren which is great, that's really important for the  base.  But what's really important is sort of the stuff that happens in  between.  I hope you guys cover some of the smaller features -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  You know, smaller in the sense of less time because they will  tell the story of Hillary Clinton. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, do you think the party has changed, I mean, from Barack  Obama to Elizabeth Warren to Bernie Sanders all the way to the left? Has  this party become much more to the left? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  I think the party platform is the most progressive that you have  seen in a long time.  And Bernie Sanders was very effective, I think in  making the case for college for all and all of that. </p><p>I think that's really important.  However, you know, it is her -- it is her  party, so she is going to put her mark on it and we know that she's going  to be -- she's going to listen to all sides. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, great to have you on the program -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, great to be here -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching your speech, thank you so much -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Thanks, all right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Jennifer Granholm joining us.  Up next, two  iconic players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>More on the emotional reaction coming up.

New details this morning as police are  investigating a fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub earlier this morning.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with that story and the headlines right now in our New York  headquarters, Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  That's right, Maria, and good morning.  Well,  officials say at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others  injured in the shooting outside of that Florida nightclub.</p><p>This happened just after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.  The Fort  Myers police telling Fox just moments ago that it's definitely not  terrorism, it appears to be gang-related.  </p><p>Though motive isn't clear.  They don't know if an argument led to the  shooting.  Three men are being questioned after they had fled the scene, no  idea what types of weapons were used.</p><p>Now, Maria, Fort Myers police say that the area is now considered safe,  this was posted on Facebook live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They're just running behind you and shooting, like,  you just see a whole bunch of kids running, just seeing somebody just  laying on the floor.</p><p>They're laying on the floor like -- got shot.  Fired ten times.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, victims were treated at two trauma centers for or still  hospitalized this morning.  The shooting comes more than a month after the  shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando which killed 49 people, that was the  deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.</p><p>The FBI is en route this morning to assist in this investigation.  Well, a  deadly heat wave continues to blink at parts of the United States.</p><p>Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona dying from the high heat  as near triple-digit temperatures, four states from New York, all the way  to California.</p><p>Now Cody Flom was in Arizona, he was hiking in the snow mountains when he  suffered a fatal heat stroke.  This is in the Phoenix area.  Overall,  temperatures could hit 100 degrees today in New York, Philadelphia and  Washington. </p><p>And the heat index could be much higher if you combine the temperature and  the humidity.  It's going to be a dangerous day weather-wise. </p><p>Well, this morning in sports, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza were indicted  into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>Piazza played 16 years with the Dodgers, Marlins, Mets, Padres and  Athletics and hit 427 home runs including a major league record 396 as a  catcher. </p><p>All this of course, happening yesterday.  Piazza played for 16 years, he is  best known of course as a Met.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PIAZZA, FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER:  It was actually the last team that I  had managed -- that I imagined wanted me.  But it was the most amazing  experience any human being could have. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Ken Griffey Jr. played 22 big league seasons with the Mariners,  Reds, and the White Sox.  He was a 13-time all-star and 10 times gold club  award winner as a centerfielder and hit 630 -- good Lord, 630 home runs,  amazing.</p><p>Griffey is best known of course as a Mariner.

Warner Brothers' \"Wonder Woman\" movie scheduled to release in June  of next year.  And that's the latest from New York, Maria, back to you in  Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you so much, Cheryl, up next, former astronaut  Mark Kelly gears up to speak at the Democratic National Convention this  week.</p><p>Before he does that though, he will give us his preview of his message to  the Democratic Party.  He'll join us live.  </p><p>And then later, Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation sending shockwaves  throughout the Democratic Party.  More on the disarray at the DNC coming  up, back in a moment. </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Our next guest endorsed Hillary Clinton back in  January, he is scheduled to speak on Wednesday night at the convention.</p><p>We want to bring in former astronaut and co-founder of Americans for  Responsible Solution, Mark Kelly.  He is the husband to former Democratic  Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. </p><p>Good to see you, thank you so much for joining us. </p><p>MARK KELLY, ASTRONAUT &amp; CO-FOUNDER, AMERICANS FOR RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION:   Thanks for having me on -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First question before anything is, how is your wife doing? </p><p>KELLY:  She's doing great, we got in late though, so she's still sleeping,  I think. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so, she's doing OK. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will be your message this week? What do you want to tell  the world? </p><p>KELLY:  You know, we don't get a lot of time, right? There's a lot of  speakers, so, a very short period of time.  </p><p>But you know, we're going to talk a little bit, you know, about -- at  least, I'm going to talk a little bit about my experience in the Navy and  in NASA and you know, what we should be doing as a country.  </p><p>And then as you might expect, I'll talk a little bit about gun violence and  you know, where we are and who we need to fix not only that problem, but  other serious problems that this country has.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Dagen, we've been talking about gun violence a lot, and  obviously this is front and center for the American people.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Hillary Clinton has actually laughed at Bernie Sanders in  terms of her proposals to crack down on guns in this country.</p><p>And do you back her position that there should be a waiver, that they  should get rid of the liability waiver for gun manufacturers.  I know that  was kind of as far left as she has ever gone in terms of gun control. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, that's a distinct difference between her -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right -- </p><p>KELLY:  And Senator Sanders.  And yes, I think so, I mean, why in this  country.  I mean, there's really just two things that get blanket immunity  and that's experimental pharmaceutical drugs from what I understand, right?</p><p>You assume a lot of risk, and then there's gun manufacturers that have a  blanket immunity and that's one of the reasons why, you know, we haven't  increased the safety of firearms. </p><p>You know why -- you know, when you look at products like cars for instance.   The death rate from car accidents goes down, and the death rate from guns  does not.</p><p>And you know, one of the things you can point to is plaque which is out of  immunity.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Mark, your wife was able to relate to people in an intensely  emotional way.</p><p>And her story really grabbed people.  I found it in this election, Hillary  Clinton has really had trouble emotionally connecting with the voters. </p><p>People are really resonating with this story, considering what you and your  wife have gone through, can you give advice to Hillary Clinton on her  campaign of how she can emotionally connect to the voters in the way that  Trump is? </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know, I'm a military veteran and an astronaut.  I might  not be the most emotional person myself in trying to connect with people.</p><p>And I'm not one to give, you know, that kind of advice.  But you're right,  you know, Gabby is really good at that.  She always has been and people do  connect with her emotionally. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you think Hillary can do that given the fact that  there all these questions about her honesty and about, you know,  likability? </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know, I have campaigned with Hillary, Gabby has, too, you  know, one-on-one and with, you know, people in the audience, I think she  connects with them very well. </p><p>This tough -- you know, this is a -- this is a tough business.  But the  contrast between Hillary and I think Donald Trump is pretty clear.  I mean,  Hillary being somebody who is experienced and a problem solver.</p><p>And somebody who really has been campaigning on rhetoric that does not  paint our country in the best possible way. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you know, I know that President Obama came out,  and said, look, everything that Donald Trump said last week doesn't jive  with reality. </p><p>But I mean, it's not exactly rainbows and puppy dogs out there.  I mean,  we've got another attack this morning.  We continue to see, you know, ISIS  fighters get stronger. </p><p>What's your solution to all of this? -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, you know, I served in combat over Iraq, you know, during  desert storm.  You know, I have experience -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>KELLY:  In that part of the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for your service to our great country -- </p><p>KELLY:  You're welcome.  I mean, we do have -- we do have problems.  And  problems require thoughtful solutions.</p><p>You know, they require -- I think they -- you know, to some extent require  somebody who has experience doing this.  And I think, you know, the choice  is clear here in November. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Matter of fact, just say to you, sir, I supported Jeb Bush in the  primary, and for the better part of the year, we try to make this argument  that experience mattered.</p><p>And it didn't work for us in the campaign.  So, I think Hillary Clinton is  going to be successful again, so, she's going to have emotionally connect,  and try something other than the experience argument. </p><p>Sixteen Republicans running, trying to say that about him and it didn't  work. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>KELLY:  You see that, I would not dispute that, but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and the danger is that the Democrats dismiss Donald Trump  and just dismiss him as she -- from the hip blowhard. </p><p>Because after last week, according to the new \"Cnn\" poll, he's got a six- percentage point bump in the polls -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is the biggest bump since the year 2000. </p><p>KELLY:  But as you would expect after the convention, and you know, you  also can't argue with the fact that he has been successful and he's been  successful for a reason.</p><p>And that should not be dismissed.  It should be taken very seriously. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think you're going to get -- you think that the  Democratic Party gets a bump after this convention? </p><p>KELLY:  I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>KELLY:  You know, history would say that, and you know, we'll see how  things look here in September and October.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you, thanks so much -- </p><p>KELLY:  Thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For joining us -- </p><p>KELLY:  Appreciate it -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Mark Kelly there.  Still to come, first  leaked e-mail showing a rigged system against Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Now, the DNC chair steps down.  More on the chaos at the DNC coming up.   And then Verizon finalizes its deal to acquire Yahoo for nearly $5 billion.</p><p>What that means for the beleaguered internet giant coming up, back in a  moment.  Stay with us, thank you -- </p><p>KELLY:  Thank you -- </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Once again, here's Maria Bartiromo. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, coming to you live this week from the Democratic National  Convention here in Philadelphia.  It is Monday, July 25th.  Your top  stories right now, 8:30 AM on the East Coast, Democrats in disarray, DNC  chairwoman Debby Wasserman Schultz loses her job after leaked e-mails show  that the committee worked behind the scenes against Bernie Sanders.   Wasserman Schultz counterpart, Reince Priebus, on the RNC side, weighs in  on the controversy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, RNC CHAIRMAN:  Today's event shows, I think, really, what  an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week and unifying their  party, and starting out the week by losing your party chairman over  longstanding bitterness between factions.  There's no way to keep something  together. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, the deal of the day, Verizon is acquiring Yahoo, in  a deal valued at $4.8 billion dollars.  The Yahoo Shares are down in the  premarket.  What it means for Marissa Mayer's future coming up.  When in  Rome, you eat pasta and pizza.  When in Philly, it's all about cheese  steaks.  We've got the two top restaurants, Gino's and Pat's, right here on  set, coming up, talking about their historic rivalry and what having with  the convention in Philly, means for business.  </p><p>Turn to the broader market this morning.  Futures are searching for some  direction this morning.  As you can see, it is a mixed showing with the Dow  Industrials expected to open up about 8 points.  We've got a lot of  economic data and earnings news to really drive the story this week.  In  Europe, stocks may see a little change.  Take a look at what's happening in  Europe this morning.  As you see, fractional gains from the FT 100, but the  DAX Index in Germany up about 1 percent.  And there was a mixed picture  overnight in Asia, where the Shanghai Composite was up a fraction as well  as the Korean Kospi, but the others lower on the day.  A top DNC staffer,  Brad Marshal, going after Bernie Sanders fate in one of the thousands  leaked e-mails sparking outrage.  Here it is, it might make no difference,  but for Kentucky -- and we can get someone to ask his belief.  Does he  believe in God?  He has skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage.  I read  he's an atheist, this could make several points difference with my peeps in  West Virginia and Kentucky.  My southern Baptist peeps would draw a big  difference between a Jew and an atheist, Amy Dacey, CEO of the DNC,  subsequently responded, amen, according to these emails.  Joining us right  now is the creator and producer of the documentary, Hillary's America,  Dinesh D'Souza.  Good to see you, Dinesh, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DINESH D'SOUZA, PRODUCER:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your reaction to this e-mail scandal? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Wow.  I mean, this is the way the Clintons have operated for a  long time.  They always put their thumb on the scale.  And so, ironically,  but this party is called the Democratic Party, you think that they'd be  democratic I.E.  Have fair rules of elections to give their people a fair  shake, see who emerges on the top, that's not the case.  It looks like  Hillary was sort of the crowned candidate from the beginning, and they were  trying to sort of weigh this horse race to make sure that Bernie just ran a  show candidacy if you will. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even on Saturday Night Live, they made a joke out of it,  basically saying, look, this thing is so rigged, and, you know -- how  about, you know, when you won all of the people, but I still got all the  super delegates.  So, there was speculation about this for a long time. </p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think the irony is on the Republican side, you have this  crowded race, 17 guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>D'SOUZA: . a bitter cage fight.  I mean a lot of mutual acrimony and  accusations.  And yet, ironically, at the end of the day the Republicans  might come together more strongly because when you have a fair process, you  can respect the winner.  When the process is rigged, then you feel like you  haven't lost, you've been cheated.  And these are all themes in our movie,  our movie is, I think, intended to be a catalyst to unify the Republicans  by pointing to the Clintons and saying, look, the Clintons don't really  play by the rules, they never have, and that's partly what this election is  about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  Congratulations, because we want to show a clip right  here.  The film is now in the top ten over the weekend, so congrats to you.   Here is a portion of the documentary that Dinesh has written and produced,  Hillary's America, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  All crime is about stealing.  The big criminals are  still at large. </p><p>CLINTON:  Didn't see any reason to keep them. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  The system doesn't go after them, because they run the  system.  It's time to go behind the curtain and discover the soul of the  Democratic Party. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you trying to achieve with this film, Dinesh? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well, partly what we're trying to do is we're trying to show that  the Democratic Party puts on a front.  We're the party for the little guy.   We're a party for minorities.  We're the party that always fought for  women's rights.  Now, historically, the opposite is true.  The Democratic  Party, historically, has been the party of slavery, of segregation.  The  Democrats fought women's suffrage for 30 years before the Republicans  pushed it through.  The Democrats who avoids the party of the clan of  lynching, of forced sterilization, so they've got an unbelievably sordid  history, and many of the Clinton scandals are just on the tip of the  iceberg. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  There was never one Republican Jim  Crowe Governor, people don't realize that.  We were the party of freedom  and emancipation.  But, Dinesh D'Souza, what is the guiding principle of  the Clintons, and who corrupted who in your opinion?  Because we know  they're both political co-conspirators in pursuit of their own ambition.   But was it Hillary who kind of got Bill to this point, or was it Bill who  got Hillary to this point? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think the guiding principle of the Clintons is me, me, me.  The  difference with Obama, Obama is an ideologue, and whether we agree with him  or now he had ideological goals.</p><p>SAYEGH:  Correct.</p><p>D'SOUZA:  The Clintons are sort of partners in crime.  They're a tag team.   Ironically, I think the driving force is always been Hillary.  And the  reason is that Hillary needs Bill more than Bill needs Hillary.  Bill would  have been a success on his own.  Hillary always knew that she needed kind  of a pitchman to be her sales guide.  And so, she needs to figure out a way  create a marriage with Bill that would cement him to her, and being his  enabler is the way to do that. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  But even after all these years, he - - Bill Clinton is an incredible resale politician, who has a connection  even with people on an individual basis.  After all these years, Hillary  Clinton is still never been able to learn that from him. </p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think that's right.  Hillary is the strategist.  In some ways,  I think, she's more ambitious, because with Bill, and you saw this when he  was president, if you put Bill Clinton in a big room and everyone tells him  he's the greatest, if his immediate needs are satisfied he's happy.  With  Hillary, I think there's a more of almost a radical impulse, if she's not  running things, telling everybody what to do, snuffing out her opponents,  she's got a much more ambitious view of what politics is all about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But your description of her will be called sexist by her  supporters.  That's where they always go.  </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The dog whistle, when she was talking about the Hillary  standard.  That's she's known to be different standards.  That was a dog  whistle to women, that if sexism has nothing to do with her behavior, it's  just the fact that she's a woman. </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well, I think that's saying the opposite.  I'm saying that she's  in the tradition of very powerful men who have always wanted to lord it  over.  I mean, if you think about the tyrannical impulse that drove a  Bonaparte, a Caesar, a Genghis Khan, is that desire to dominate.  Bill  doesn't have it, Hillary does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:   Do you think what's being said at this convention this week is  going to resonate with people, or do you think what you're saying -- how do  you think it's going to play out for the voter? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well, this is why I'm trying really hard to get independents and  minorities to come see our movie.  Because -- we had black actors in our  movie, when they saw the film they were blown away.  They said we had no  idea this was our actual history.  So the Democrats will put out the  official story, they always do, we have a counter narrative running in  1,500 theaters across the country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Dinesh, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>D'SOUZA:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate, we'll be watching, Dinesh D'Souza there.    Coming up, the resignation of Debby Wasserman Schultz, just one of the  controversies clouding the convention kick off.  Stuart Varney says the  scandals are changing the party for good.  He'll join us next.  And then  reports say Tesla and Solar City are inching closer to coming together,  coming up.  More on how that merger may go forward.  Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Philadelphia this morning.  We're 45  minutes away from the opening bell.  The market is expected to open  fractionally higher, really searching for direction.  Here's a look at some  stocks on the move this morning.  Yahoo shares under pressure after the  company's core assets are being sold to Verizon, Verizon acquiring Yahoo  for $4.8 billion.  One question still up in the air, Yahoo CEO, Marissa  Mayer's future.  She said she will stay at the company, but Verizon  executives are not saying that quite yet.  Solar City shares up 3 percent  this morning, the company reportedly close to a merger with Tesla.  Reuters  has reporting that the two companies are in final stages of carrying out  due diligence.  When the initial reported the deal came out last month,  questions were raised because Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and he's also  the chairman of Solar City.  Musk has refused himself he said from voting  on this deal.  </p><p>Today's Democratic Convention kicks off with an e-mail scandal, a  resignation, and angry protesters as the party's nomination ceremony is  rocked by controversy.  Stuart Varney said that this is not your father's  Democratic Party anymore.  Stuart joins us right now with more.  Stuart,  Good morning to you. </p><p>STUART VARNEY, VARNEY &amp; CO. HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  Let me qualify  that, if I may. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is not your father's Democratic Party in terms of policy.  I  mean, it's really swung way out to the left.  But it's your grandfather's  party when it comes to the leadership thereof.  I mean, it's still -- speak  of Pelosi.  It's still senator from Nevada, Harry Reid.  It's still Hillary  Clinton.  These are names and figures from the past that solidified their  position and they still lead the party.  This is the party of the elites.   They seemed to have missed the message that the anti-elite feeling in this  country is very, very strong, capitalized by Donald trump, who leads the  Republican Party in a relatively unified fashion.  Now, you have a bitterly  divided Democrat Party led by the elites still with the insurgent Bernie  Sanders being conspired against.  I want to know, Maria, what's he going to  say tonight?   He speaks tonight.   If he turns around and says, OK, we'll  play kumbaya, let's unify.  He's betrayed himself and he betrayed his  supporters.   If he goes out there and says I'm really angry about this,  he's totally undermining Hillary Clinton and dividing the Democrat Party.   This is fascinating stuff, isn't it? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  And you know what?  Jennifer Granholm was just  on, and I asked her that question, has she seen a big change in the  Democratic Party, is it much more liberal than ever before?  She said this  is the most progressive agenda.</p><p>VARNEY:  What?</p><p>BARTIROMO: . the party has ever seen.  That's what she just said. </p><p>VARNEY:  It's a socialist party.  Look, I maybe -- you've got to criticize  me for being extreme, but it's a socialist policy.  That's the policy that  they've adopted by this old style people, who's been in the news for 20 or  30 years, ignoring the people, the up and comers, the millennials, the  Bernie Sanders of this world who really want change in the party structure.   What a dichotomy it really is. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Stuart, isn't it -- it's Tony Sayegh, isn't it ironic that at one  point during this primary season, Hillary Clinton said she was going to  appoint Bill Clinton to basically manage the economy.  Bill Clinton  regulated Wall Street, he cuts capital gain taxes.  He was very pro-growth  reform entitlements, free trade agreements, obviously, Donald Trump points  his support of NAFTA, and China joining the WTO, isn't that all  contradiction to.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>SAYEGH: . the modern Democratic Progressive Party? </p><p>VARNEY:  Absolutely.  Yes, it is, Tony.  Well said.  Couldn't have put it  better myself.  Do you want to come on my show a little later, because that  was good stuff.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's going to raise the minimum wage, she's going to raise  taxes. </p><p>VARNEY:  Yep.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's against the TPP.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She wants to expand social security.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yep.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Expand Medicare which is going broke in 12 years.  She wants --  again, she wants to really a public option in Medicare as well. </p><p>VARNEY:  I'm just dying to see what Bernie Sanders says tonight.  I mean. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, me, too. </p><p>VARNEY: . whichever way he goes, this party is in real trouble.  Oh, what a  difference a weekend does make.  Remember last week, it was all the  Republicans, oh, chaos this and plagiarism that.  What nonsense.  Look  what's going on this week, for heaven sake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  We'll see if Bernie Sanders addresses the Debbie  Wasserman Schultz resignation tonight.  We'll be watching.  And, Stuart, of  course, we're going to see you in ten minutes.  We'll be watching Varney &amp;  Co.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Varney &amp; Co., begins every day, 9 AM  Eastern, right after Mornings With Maria.  Up next, one food famously  associated with the city of brotherly love, the Philly cheese steak, we  haven't forgotten them.  Straight ahead, we're talking to two of the iconic  name in the business and their 50-year-old rivalry, that's raking in the  big money.  Keep it right here, Mornings With Maria, comes right back with  Philly cheese steaks.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  There is one food famously associated with the  city of brotherly love.  It is the Philly cheese steak.  And it is been  around since 1930.  I want to bring in two of the iconic names in the  cheese steak business, Frank Olivieri, owner of Pat's King of Steaks, and  Geno Vento, president of Geno's steaks.  Good to see you guys, thank you so  much for joining us. </p><p>GENO VENTO, GENO'S STEAKS OWNER:  Well, thank you for having us.</p><p>FRANK OLIVIERI, PAT'S KINGS OF STEAK OWNER:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that you guys are massive rivals.   You're right across the street from each other, and yet, you're friends. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Year, we're rivals, we're friends.  We live in the same  building, actually. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, how big is this business, the cheese steaks? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  It's booming. </p><p>VENTO:  It's insane.  </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.</p><p>VENTO:  Cheese steaks it's a Philadelphia comfort food, everybody wants it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  And so, that's right.  It's iconic.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . right?  And so do you expect a big boost for business with the  DNC in town this week? </p><p>VENTO:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, just the amount of people just coming in  and being a tourist destination, I mean, it's the thing to do when you come  to Philly, get a cheese steak.  So, you have two right here. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  I usually say people comes to Philadelphia they get a cheese  steak from one of our place.  Look at the liberty bell in front of Rocky  statue. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, that's what they do.  Why is cheese steak so, you  know, so iconic, and so great about Philly, why? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  It's just one of those things, my great Uncle Pat and my  grandfather invented the sandwich back in 1930, and it's just an iconic  sandwich.  And, you know, Geno's father right across the street. </p><p>VENTO:  It's '66. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  It's '66, and we've been fierce rivals ever since, but we're  best friends. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  And so, when you -- what's the sales pitch to go  to Geno's or go to Pat's, which one should I do?  You know, can you believe  I've never had a cheese steak from Philly?</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Really?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  I've been hearing all about it for years. </p><p>VENTO:  Well, you've got like 10 of them right in front of you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got all these cheese steaks.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  How did they let you into the city without having one before? </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- when I'm here.  So, what's the secret sauce to the  Philly cheese steak? </p><p>VENTO:  Well, the official cheese stake of Philadelphia would be the cheese  whiz, and then you get onions or no onions.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Exactly.</p><p>VENTO:  So, do you like onions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I guess so.</p><p>VENTO:  All right.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  I think the secret to it is that I think, you know, we both take  pride in our product.  I mean, if I won't eat it, I won't sell it, and I  know Geno feels the same way. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You guys are both running small businesses that have become,  you know, bigger businesses, obviously.  Tell me how business is right now? </p><p>VENTO:  It's unbelievable.  I mean, we're doing record numbers and, you  know, being the tourism and being the summertime, and what Philly has to  offer, I mean, I can't speak for Frankie, but, you know, it's doing very  well. </p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that Frankie? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  We're doing very well.  As a matter of fact, Elizabeth Warren  was down yesterday -- now we say the winning president always comes out,  you know, our stores. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I know, exactly.  So, it's a must-stop for celebrities  and for politicians, why is that, because they want to have an iconic  sandwich? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  I think they want to win that, you know, small vote, when it get  in the nitty-gritty of Philadelphia, and then cheese steaks are in the  nitty-gritty of Philadelphia. </p><p>VENTO:  And they want to be in the heart of South Philly, that's where all  the action happens. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you've seen a change in business just over the last day or  so, I mean, tell me what you've seen so far from the DNC and its impact? </p><p>VENTO:  I mean, just the lines forming, you know, people coming in,  taking  pictures, getting, you know, half of it being able to see all of them come  in, and so all the secret service, you know, the delegates, and, you know,  I mean, they have to eat, too, you know. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, have you made a different plans or arrangements to  accommodate all these new people coming in. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  We ordered extra bread, and I'm sure he did, too. </p><p>VENTO:  Yeah, we do.  That's right. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  What we did was -- we're kind of running a crazy promotion where  we're making a Hillary Clinton sandwich and a Bernie Sanders sandwich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  And we're going to see at the end of the week who's ordered more  sandwiches, kind of like a fun little thing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  What's the difference between a Bernie sandwich  and a Hillary? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Well, the Hillary sandwich we call it a heart attack, it has the  three cheese.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, the heart attack. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  And the Bernie Sanders sandwich which we call it the gaboom,  which is it has the mushrooms, peppers, onions, cheese wiz, and. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You put it all on. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Put it all on, yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Do you do anything like that? </p><p>VENTO:  No, we're still in the regular cheese steak.  I'm afraid to do  that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because that's been resonating already.  </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So how much is the cheese steaks? </p><p>VENTO:  $10. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Same price.  We price that over dinner together.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, then there's got to be lots of companies that are sort  of like want to do business with you, right?  Everybody wants to have the  Geno's or the Frankie's cheese steak? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.  Actually, there's one more guy who lives in our building,  Tony Luke, and he's the other one, we're like the three amigos. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They all live in the same building.  </p><p>OLIVIERI:  We all live in the same building.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that by design? </p><p>VENTO:  Well, I was first, tony was second, and then me and Tony talked to  Frankie into moving in. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else can I buy at the cheese steak shop?  Not cheese  steak. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Cheese steak you can get -- well we started with hot dogs.  So  you can get a hot dog at my place, and we have pork.  Do you serve roast  pork? </p><p>VENTO:  Yeah we have roast pork.  We have Italians hoagies, and I'm  bringing meatball pork back. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  All right.  Well, I've going to have to take a bite  of one of these, Frank Olivieri, Geno Vento, really good to see you, both. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Oh, thank you, Maria, thanks for having us.</p><p>VENTO:   Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations and good luck on the big week. </p><p>VENTO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Thank you, </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from our all-star panel live from the  Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Before we go, let's get some final thoughts from  our all-star panel.  We are kicking off the Democratic National Convention.   Morgan, what are you thinking about? </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Everyone is talking about  Bernie Sanders, what he's going to say tonight.  I'm actually most looking  forward to hearing what Elizabeth Warren has to say, because I think she's  great at firing up the base, and I don't think she's going to be happy over  this DNC controversy.  So, I'm looking for Elizabeth Warren -- I think  she'll be the litmus test for the rest of the liberals. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  How can you be happy when you've got all these  protesters outside?  I actually hit the streets yesterday, I saw these  protests heating up.  I took a couple of pictures.  Then they started  hosing one another.  But all the streets were closed down.  You couldn't  get anywhere because the protesters were just dominating. </p><p>SAYEGH:  This was a rocky start and it's turning into a political  avalanche.  Do not under estimate the weight of the party chair, the head  of this convention, resigning a day before these proceedings begin.  I  think the Bernie Sanders delegates are going to react differently than  Bernie Sanders himself.  And throw in there this, Maria, I also believe  they're not happy with this election, the Sanders folks of V.P. Kaine.  And  that's going to get them agitated as well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Probably true, yeah. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Pay attention to the whole speakers list, because today it is  union leaders, and it is Dan Malloy, the governor of my state of  Connecticut who can teach you how to drive business out of your state by  raising taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who can teach you how to destroy jobs.  And they want to know  why the economy is in the state that it is, look at the speaker list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thanks everybody, great show.  We'll see you  tomorrow, same time, same place, but first, Varney &amp; Co., begins right now,  over to Stuart, Stu.    </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

I am Maria  Bartiromo.  Welcome back.  It is Monday, July 25.  Your top stories right  now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Drama at the Democratic national convention and it hasn't even started yet.   It kicks off today.</p><p>Party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announcing her resignation, after  an e-mail leak shows that DNC favored Clinton over Bernie Sanders the  entire primary season.  Clinton campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon weighed  in on the shake-up last night on Fox News.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN FALLON, CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON:  Debbie Wasserman Schultz is  committed to defeating Donald Trump.  So she's going to stay involved in  terms of helping us lead a 50-state campaign.  But I think given all the  distractions that have arisen in the last of couple days especially in  light of these e-mails this was a very good step that will help unite the  party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is raising new questions about party unity certainly.   Sanders is set to address the convention tonight and his supporters have  already begun filling the streets.  They were protesting all day yesterday.</p><p>Breaking news this morning -- another shooting, this time at a nightclub in  Florida, at least two people killed, 17 others injured.  Authorities are  searching for suspects.  We have the details, coming up.</p><p>And the deal of the day: Verizon acquiring Yahoo -- the announcement  crossing the tape right now.  The deal is valued at $4.8 billion.  What it  means for the future of the struggling web company coming up.  The stocks  are halted in the premarket right now.</p><p>A big weekend at the box office to tell you about.  \"Star Trek fans went to  the theatres in droves.  Details on film's ticket sales coming up and how  well it did.</p><p>Markets this morning is showing a flat performance, edging higher.  The Dow  Industrials going back and forth between negative and positive territory  this morning, as you can see there.  Later in the week investors have a lot  to digest including economic data, a two-day Federal Reserve meeting, a  meeting in the Bank of Japan and a whole host of second quarter earnings  particularly in the tech sector.</p><p>In Europe today stocks are higher.  Take a look -- fractional moves there  as well but they are higher across the board.  The FT 100 just flipping  into positive territory eking out a gain right now of about 1 point, the  DAX index has approved over the last hour, up about 1 percent right now and  the CAC 40 in Paris up three-quarters of one percent. </p><p>It was a mixed performance in Asia overnight.  As you can see there,  fractional move as you see.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning right here.</p><p>And joining me this morning to talk about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Maverick PAC national co-chair Morgan Ortagus, and Republican  strategist Tony Sayegh.  Good to see everybody.  </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning -- Maria. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  It's great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I thought Dennis Kucinich had some really interesting  comments earlier.  He is basically saying, look, Bernie Sanders should not  take this and withdraw your endorsement.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  It seems as if Bernie Sanders has begun to detach from his own  movement as early as he began to indicate endorsement to Hillary Clinton.   We're showing footage of protests here in Philadelphia.  By the way,  Sanders supporters have the most number of protester permits at the DNC.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SAYEGH:  So keep that in mind.  You have almost 2,000 Sanders delegates.  I  don't think Sanders himself is going to create any distance or maybe do  something beyond endorse Hillary Clinton tonight.  But I think his  supporters are very reluctant to do so.</p><p>You see already opposition to the Kaine pick.  They think he's way too  centrist, way too moderate, wrong on trade, goes with Wall Street.  This is  not going to be an easy convention for the Democrats.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We will see if he refers to it tonight.  He's going to be  among the kickoff speakers tonight, Bernie Sanders and First Lady Michelle  Obama.  We're going to talk about all this coming up.</p><p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is with us this hour; New York  Congresswoman Caroline Maloney is with us this morning, Former astronaut  and Gabrielle Giffords' husband Mark Kelly will join us, and former  Michigan governor, a senior advisory to a super PAC backing Hillary Clinton  Jennifer Granholm is with us as well.</p><p>Meanwhile a major shake-up rocking the Democratic Party amid a new e-mail  scandal just hours before the Democratic national convention kicks off here  in Philadelphia.</p><p>I want to get right to Blake Berman.  He's inside the Wells Fargo Arena  here in Philly.  Blake -- good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BERMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there -- Maria.  Good morning to you  as well.</p><p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz later today will gavel in the Democratic national  convention.  She'll give a speech later this week.  And she will gavel it  out the convention on Thursday and that will be it for her as it relates to  her duties as the chairwoman of the DNC.</p><p>Wasserman Schultz yesterday here in Philadelphia, announcing that she will  resign at the end of this convention due to the WikiLeaks scandal.  Of  course, over the weekend WikiLeaks released some 19,000 internal DNC memos  which showed that during the primary process, several top DNC staffers  actively favored Bernie Sanders -- actively favored rather Hillary Clinton  over Bernie Sanders -- in fact trying to tip the scales Clinton's way over  Sanders.  Wasserman Schultz herself had some choice words in some e-mails  as it related to Sanders' campaign manager.</p><p>Last evening Brian Fallon who is one of the top spokespeople for Hillary  Clinton said that they would not defend those e-mails but they also believe  that the e-mails prove or ate least show that nothing would have changed as  a result to the end result of the primary process.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FALLON:  Let's not confuse these e-mails which I am not going to defend  with the idea of a rigged nomination process.  The election was really won  on the ground. It was the voters in the Democratic primary that decided  Hillary Clinton should be our nominee.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Donald Trump as you might imagine was jumping all over this  yesterday.  He sent out a series of tweets; one which reads and I am  quoting here.  He writes \"The Democrats are in a total meltdown.  But the  biased media will say how great they are doing.  E-mails say the rigged  system is alive and well.\"</p><p>Of course, Maria -- the entire time Trump has been trying to make the  argument that the primary process on both sides is rigged.  He continued to  make that case yesterday, very strategic though on his part as he will try  to bring some of those Sanders supporters over to his side.  Sanders, by  the way, speaks inside here later this evening.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake -- thank you so much.  Blake Berman.</p><p>We want to bring in former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  Governor --  good to see you.  What is your take on all of this?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The scandal the DNC e-mail dumps and now Debbie Wasserman  Schultz forced to step down?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well I am pretty sure the DNC wishes that they had put all of  their e-mails on Hillary's server where things just disappear but,  unfortunately, it all got leaked.  And, you know, the trouble is that the  first day of their convention is all about the controversy of the e-mails.</p><p>And Bernie Sanders supporters are out there in the streets.  Bernie looks  like he's kind of waved the white flag of surrender.  But as I said last  night on Fox, Hillary comes into this convention with more baggage than  Delta Airlines.  It's a going to be a rocky week.</p><p>And for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she's going to be virtually invisible.   You will be seeing her face on milk cartons during the week in Philadelphia  -- I am pretty sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Well look, we should point out that Hillary just hired  Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  So that is only going to fuel the fire, that --  they are in the tank.  I mean -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, look -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, I mean -- why would she do that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was best for her.  She got fired so Hillary gave her a job.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  I would love to ask the governor this question and definitely get  your perspective on this.  And we talked about this with Dennis Kucinich  earlier.  He was outraged as well.</p><p>There were indications that they were planning to use Bernie Sanders'  religious views against him.  They were going to put out these open  questions about whether or not he was an atheist.  They were going to try  to wedge that as an issue in a state like West Virginia.</p><p>Governor, I mean you're a man of faith.  You were obviously presidential  candidate, former candidate.  I mean how does that sound to you?  And, of  course, then to Maria's point, Hillary says ok, well, you are going to  leave the DNC but now you're on the HRC campaign.  I mean does that make  sense at all?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No it doesn't at all.  And I think it really creates a problem  for Hillary to say ok, so we expose that Debbie Wasserman Schultz really  didn't play her role as objectively and fairly as she was supposed to do.   She was in the tank for Hillary.  She violated really all of the ethical  standards that a party chairman should uphold.  So we are going to hire  her.</p><p>I mean if you've got a candidate who has a 68 percent lack of  trustworthiness view by the American people then who do you hire?  Somebody  who has a worse reputation than you do.  I mean only Hillary would hire  somebody to deal with her credibility problem who has less credibility than  Hillary.</p><p>I do agree with you that this religion issue -- that's huge because it  really shows that there was no depths that they were willing to -- that  they were unwilling to mine.  You know, Bernie supporters are against  fracking but I am going to tell you something it became very apparent in  these e-mail leaks that the deepest drilling was going on at the DNC trying  to go into such things Bernie Sanders' faith which frankly has nothing to  do with whether he's capable of being president.  And I think everybody  should be and is offended by that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to create a whole narrative about well, let's get  somebody to ask him if he even believes in God.  You know my peeps in West  Virginia -- that will really resonate with them.</p><p>Listen to what Hillary Clinton said about this because she was asked about  it in this interview that they gave to \"60 Minutes\".  Listen to this --  Governor.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I didn't know anything about  it.  And I haven't read any of those but I am adamantly opposed to anyone  bringing religion into our political process.  I mean the constitution says  no religious tests so that is just absolutely wrong and unacceptable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on that -- attacking a candidate on their  religion and how she answered it -- Governor?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It is kind of like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and you have  Sergeant Schultz.  Hillary Clinton -- I know nothing, I know nothing.  And  that has been her answer on a lot of things. </p><p>Perhaps she didn't know.  I am going to have to assume Hillary Clinton  didn't know what was being talked about in the inner sort of -- may be  walls of the DNC.  I get that.</p><p>But it is offensive.  I am glad that she repudiated it.  But frankly, you  know, if Bernie Sanders is an atheist so be it.  Honestly, I would rather  have an honest atheist as president than I had a phony believer.  So I say  that as a person who is a person of faith and as a Christian just want  authenticity.  I want somebody to be who they are.</p><p>And you know, let us make the decision.  There is no religious test to poll  public office in America.  But I have got more respect for people who are  honest about where they stand than I do with people who pretend that they  believe something when in fact they don't.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is hard to say that nobody knew anything because this  whole narrative has been out for a long time.  A lot of people have been  criticizing the fact that the debates, for example, were on nights when no  one was watching TV.</p><p>Real quick, Governor -- before you go let's talk policy for a second.  What  are we going to hear this week from the Dems that might be different from  what we heard last week when it comes to policy and what Hillary Clinton  would do as president?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think everything.</p><p>You know you are going to -- really see a dramatic contrast on law and  order, on trade, on the economy, on dealing with terrorism, even on  admitting where terrorism really rests.  It is going to be as complete a  contrast as possible.</p><p>And I think Hillary's problem is how does she placate the far left which is  really in control more and more of her party and get them to be  enthusiastic about her candidacy and her potential administration.  She's  got a challenge on her hands with that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>All right Governor -- great to see you as always.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You bet.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee there.  </p><p>We will also hear about minimum wage -- right.  They're going to raise  minimum wage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Watch this today though.  All the speakers, many of them,  are from unions.  They're union leaders.  You've Randi Weingarten -- a  lineup of them because the only good jobs in America are union jobs.  That  is what they are going to start arguing.  And why did those jobs go  overseas in the first place?  Because the unions were on verge of putting  the companies out of business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do what the union want -- raise taxes and raise wages.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And fill their coffers so then they can promote Democratic  candidates because that's what union workers really do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  There you go.</p><p>Coming up we are following the breaking news of a nightclub shooting in  Fort Myers, Florida leaving at least two people dead, 17 others injured</p><p>Then the drawn-out bidding process is over.  Yahoo finally has a buyer,  Verizon -- $4.8-billion buyout of the former web pioneer, Yahoo.  Coming  up.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Police are investigating a failed shooting at a Florida nightclub early  this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the story and the headlines at  headquarters now.  Cheryl -- good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  We are trying to get some  new details for you this morning on the shooting.  Officials say at least  two people were killed, and as many as 17 others were injured in this  shooting outside of a Florida nightclub, this happened, just after midnight  in Fort Myers at Club Blue.  Gunshots rang out in the parking lot and at  this hour there are two active crime scenes that we know of.</p><p>Here's what one mother said.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I just thank God that my daughter is ok.  Because she  could have been shot, her dodging bullets and running, dropping between  cars as she did.  What kids have to go through they can't enjoy themselves. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Casone:  This is an all age event, by the way, Maria that was happening in  Fort Myers.  Authorities say injuries range from minor to life-threatening  right now.  Three people have been taken in to custody and the  investigation is continuing.  The shooting comes more than a month after  the shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando which killed 49 people.  That  was the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.  </p><p>Well, switching gears this morning there was no winner for Saturday's  Powerball jackpot worth $391 million so the prize is growing -- it's now at  $422 million for Wednesday's drawing.  That is the ninth largest in  Powerball history.  By the way, if you're feeling kind of confident this  morning, the odds of a $2 ticket hitting the jackpot are more than 292  million to one.  The jackpot has only been hit three times, this year.   Last year the Powerball numbers were picked 12 times -- so good luck.  </p><p>And finally this -- Maria.  Very interesting study today -- a new study by  a research firm MSCI finds the best paid CEOs tend to run some of the worst  performing companies.  The analysis shows that $100 invested in the 20  percent companies with the highest paid CEOs would have grown to $265  dollars over 10 years.  But the same amount investment in the companies  with the lowest paid CEOs would have grown to $367.  You can do the math on  this one -- guys.  The study about examined 800 CEOs during the decade  ending back in 2014 -- Maria.  So Marissa Mayer might be thinking about  that one this morning.   </p><p>Back to you in Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- Cheryl.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Are you surprised by that study -- Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not really.  Not very surprised, the Marisa Mayer thing though,  I want to point out what I pointed out last hour -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- $50 million if she is let go as part of this deal when she's  already earned $100 million in cash compensation and stocks.  </p><p>I don't know -- again, you get paid for driving a company's value into the  ground.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, you know, it's crazy especially since we argue so much from  the political side about meritocracy and the free market, you know, being  able to do it the best.  How could a CEO who performs so badly still get so  much money?  That doesn't seem to me to be a best practice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wonder if that becomes a talking point though during the DNC - - </p><p>SAYEGH:  Not to give them any ideas.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because the politicians would love to tell private companies  how much to pay their CEOs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But when it comes to technology.  Did you see yesterday?   I saw on Twitter, that Facebook said they made a mistake but they had  blocked all the WikiLeaks dump.  And they came and they unblocked -- oh,  can we unblock?  It was mistake.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was a lot of blocking of that information on Twitter  specifically.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twitter, Facebook -- so I mean you talk about DNC and  technology -- they're together.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, we should remember that next time -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Suppression of a free press is suppression of free speech.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really gets me angry because it is all about free speech.   They said it was a mistake.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, so the next time they say that they can't block ISIS when  it comes on Twitter or Facebook we can just remind them that they were able  to do it with WikiLeaks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They really don't aggressively -- particularly Twitter, they do  not aggressively police those ISIS accounts and it is almost unthinkable  and so repugnant.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But to block information -- I mean WikiLeaks was the  biggest story all day yesterday.  People wanted to see these e-mails and  they decide to just block it.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  And I bet it wasn't trending on Google since we know they  manipulate searches to benefit Hillary Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You brought up technology and  technology with the DNC -- actually there I think they're on the same side.   Now Peter Thiel though, we saw him the other night at the RNC.</p><p>SAYEGH:  Amazing speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did a great job.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Highlight of the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It really was.  All right.  Let's take a break.</p><p>We want to check markets as we go to a break right here because futures  certainly have improved in the last half an hour.  Take a look.</p><p>Nasdaq's been in the red pretty much for the last hour but we're looking at  (inaudible) interest in the larger names in the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  Futures indicating a hire opening for those averages  open.</p><p>Investors are eyeing a slew of big technology earnings this week ahead of  the open -- Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet -- all  reporting quarterly results.</p><p>Coming up, it is official.  Verizon finalizes its deal to acquire Yahoo for  nearly $5 billion -- what that means for the beleaguered Internet giant.   Coming up.</p><p>Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>This just in moments ago -- Verizon making an acquisition of Yahoo official  for $4.8 billion, the deal giving VerizonYahoo's one billion monthly  active users and its digital content building on the online businesses  Verizon acquired through its $4.4-billion acquisition of AOL last year.</p><p>Joining us right now from New York, Recon Capital CIO Kevin Kelly.  We're  looking at Yahoo shares looking fractionally lower and, of course, Verizon  also active.</p><p>Kevin -- what is your take on the deal?  Is this going to work?  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL:  This deal is going to work especially for  Verizon.  One of the reasons why is because they can actually monetize the  assets and plug it into a mobile world that we have right now.  We have  seen that has been the problem with Yahoo.  They were always six months too  late.</p><p>They never really transitioned to the mobile so that is why you couldn't  see them increase their advertising revenue.  I mean they were getting  single digit growth while everyone else including Microsoft and Bing were  growing at double digits.</p><p>So this is a really good deal for Verizon.  They'll be able to unlock a lot  of value from this. And that is why I don't think any other birders could  come close to the $4.8 billion.</p><p>But it's important to note, that Marissa Mayer has not done well with this  company at all.  What she did is she actually bought Tumblr for a billion  dollars and guess what -- had to write down the entire company value and  they used Facebook's ad platform right now.</p><p>So she said -- even said I will not mess this up.  And that is all she has  done this entire time.  So shareholders are going to rejoice right now  because they were given a negative equity value to the core Yahoo business  but this is really going to firm up the shares before they open this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, Verizon's goal is to basically build an online  advertising competitor to the likes of Google and Facebook but if you look  at the share of the total digital and ad market out there it's about half  or more than half for Google and Facebook and it's in single digits if you  look at Yahoo.  And even the existing properties AOL which Verizon owns, it  is less than 2 percent at AOL, and at Yahoo it's only a little less than  3.5 percent.  So they have a long way to go if they think that they are  going to really take on the big dogs.  </p><p>KELLY:  I am glad you brought that up because what they have, though that  is so much more valuable is they actually have their wireless network where  they can actually have geo-positioning on their advertising so if I go to a  Rangers game they actually can pinpoint where I am at and serve custom ads  to me.</p><p>So that's a huge added value that advertisers are willing to pay up for  because it's going to be a more precise advertising especially a live  advertising.  So that is why this deal will be praised and they can gain  some more market share because that is worth more because digital  advertising is worth less than desktop advertising right now except when  you can pinpoint and do precise advertising like they're looking to do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that is why I have my location services turned off on my  phone because I don't want anybody knowing where I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the time.</p><p>Thanks very much.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  So do I.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Get this, you guys.  In a Tumblr post this morning  Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer says that she's planning to stay.  So she said she  is going to stay, you know Dagen brought this big payday she's going to get  when she leaves.  But what is her role going to be in this merger?  Do we  know -- Kevin?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Her next role is actually zero and you can see even Verizon  executives said that before the sale process even existed.  She's obviously  looked at her contract.  She sees that they're going to wait for her to  acquire then she can get her golden parachute and go.  But she should be  staying in this because protecting herself.</p><p>But one of the reasons why her contract was so much is that she actually  had all these Google options before they went to Alphabet that were about  to vest.  So in order to bring her on over they actually needed to  compensate her for it.</p><p>So I am actually more mad that she brought over Dick Castro, who -- from  Google, as well as bunch of her other cronies -- sycophantic maniacs that  weren't able to do anything and paid them.  She's destroyed a lot of  shareholder value and not only did she do it for herself but she did it for  her friends.</p><p>So I can see her doing this.  She bungled the Tumblr thing.  She's actually  bungled the sales effort.  She threw a giant party in Christmas time where  she's -- and spent a bunch of money wherein she was laying off, I don't  know, like I don't know -- maybe 10 percent, maybe 25 percent of the  workforce.</p><p>The culture there has been terrible.  So this is good news for everyone  that works at not only Verizon but also Yahoo because they're going to get  some good talent because you saw a bunch of talent leave Yahoo.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well -- ouch.  I like her.  I mean don't know, you know,  obviously the valuation plummeted under her performance and shareholders  have not done well.  But there you go -- wish her the best.</p><p>Kevin -- thank you.  </p><p>KELLY:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said she's going to get $50 million.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If they fire her.  If they terminate her she gets $50 million on  top of the 100 million that she's made so far running the company -- ended  up well, reducing the value of the company just to be kind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She says she is staying.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see what happens.</p><p>Up next, a major shake-up rocking the Democratic Party this morning amid a  new e-mail scandal -- yes, a new one -- just hours before the convention  kicks off in Philadelphia.  More on the disarray at the DNC.</p><p>We're live from Philadelphia this week.  </p><p>Later \"Live long and prosper\" at the box office.  The latest installment of  the \"Star Trek\" franchise kicks off its theater debut on a strong note.   More on the money behind the sci-fi favorite -- next.</p><p>Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UINDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Once again, here's Maria Bartiromo. </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Welcome back.  Good Monday  morning, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from the  Democratic National Convention here in Philadelphia.  It is Monday, July  25th.  Here are your top story's 7:30 AM on the East Coast, drama at the  Democratic National Convention, it hasn't even started yet, party  chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announcing she will resign after an  e-mail link shows the DNC favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders  throughout the primary season.  New poll showed Donald Trump got a  convention bounce meanwhile according to the CNN/ORC.  He has 44 percent  support to now Clinton's 39 percent.  Meanwhile, Clinton and her running  mate, Senator Tim Kaine, sitting down for their first interview last night,  and Kaine weigh in on the relationship between the White House and  congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIM KAINE, VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do.  I absolutely do.  I think  the house is going to remain a Republican.  He has, I think the margin will  be narrow.  Some of the big things that we have to do, immigration reform,  tax reform, mental health reform, criminal justice reform, they're only  going to get tough.  I think they're only going to get done probably with a  divided house scenario where each side got to give them something. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this raising new questions about party unity, Sanders is  set to address the convention tonight.  He's one of the key speakers  tonight.  His supporters, however, have been filling the streets of  Philadelphia with signs about Bernie.  The scary scene for the Dallas  Cowboy teams bus, meanwhile, no staffers were on the bus were injured.   We've got all the details coming up on this story as well.  Making happy  hour healthy?  Booze makers jumping on the healthy eating trend to draw in  new costumers.  And a big weekend at the box office to tell you about, Star  Trek fans went to the theaters in droves, details on the film sales coming  up. </p><p>Markets this morning, a fractionally higher, really edging higher in a  quiet morning ahead of a whole host of earnings and the -- big events for  the market, Dow Industrial expected to be up about seven points at the  opening this morning.  Later on in the week, investors will have a lot to  digest between economic data, a two day Fed meeting, a Bank of Japan  meeting, and a lot of earnings, particularly in the tech sector.  In  Europe, stocks are higher across the board this morning.  Take a look.   We've got the DAX Index up about 1 percent.  That's the leader index this  morning.  The CAC prompt in Paris and the FT 100 also up a fraction.  But  mixed performances overnight in Asia, take a look, as you could see  fractional moves, however, very much a mix story. </p><p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announcing that she will step down as DNC  chairwoman, this after WikiLeaks posted 20,000 hacked DNC e-mails on the  internet.  The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary  Clinton, then released a statement thanking her, quote, longtime friend for  her leadership, while revealing that Wasserman Schultz will serve as an  honorary chair of Clinton's campaign, so Hillary gave her a job.  Earlier  in the show, Dennis Kucinich offers some advice for Bernie Sanders in light  of this new development.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think Bernie Sanders should do more here. </p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, U.S. POLITICAN:  Well, I actually think that it's time for  him to consider withdrawing the endorsement, because it's not just about  him, it's about a movement that he represents which got 46 percent of the  votes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to talk more about it is congresswoman,  Carolyn Maloney.  Congressman, good to see you. </p><p>CAROLYN MALONEY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Should Bernie Sanders  withdraw that endorsement? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, Bernie Sanders support this election, and this convention  is not about e-mails.  It's about the issues, it's the economy, homeland  security, and I agree with Bernie when he said, forget the damn e-mails.   It's not about e-mails.  So, this is about, for us, at least, electing  Hillary Clinton president. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, because I think you make a really good  point in terms of what the issues are.  Look, Donald Trump has his  supporters, Hillary Clinton has her supporters, and they are loyalists on  both sides.  We know that.  And then there's this enormous group of  independents out there.  What do you think we're going to hear this week  and what can they say this week, all of the speakers, to actually lure in  the independents? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, Hillary Clinton, unlike her opponent has a lifetime of  experience, and you would hear this throughout the convention.  Ways that  she has helped our economy, helped our country, helped our people.  And  he's saying trust me, I'll do this, I'll do that.  She has details, factual  proposals on everything, from Renewable energy, to homeland security, to  the economy.  You'll see a deep contrast.  And not only a record of  achievements, but also her plans for the future, and how she proposes to  turn these plans into a reality.  And she has a history of working across  the aisle, as did her husband when he was president.  And we have the best  economy in my lifetime, 22 private sector jobs created, under President  Obama 14.8 million private sector jobs created.  And I've got to say that  you will see such unity and depth.  Bernie Sanders, quoting him again, my  top goal is electing Hillary Clinton president and defeating Donald Trump.   You will see a unified party.  Sure, there're some delegates that prefer  Bernie, but at the end of this convention we'll all have a big D on our  shirts, and we're going to be out there working hard to get her elected. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Unity inside that arena,  congresswoman, but certainly not outside in terms of the protesters,  because, again, if you look around and talk to people, they are here to  support Bernie Sanders.  They are not here to support Hillary Clinton.  Do  you worry that those Sanders supporters -- maybe they don't go vote for  Donald Trump, but they just won't vote at all because they don't trust her. </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I believe that they trust Bernie, and Bernie is supporting  her.  And Bernie's top goal is to elect Hillary Clinton president.  And I  know Bernie -- I'm good friends with him and with Hillary.  And I know him,  no one will work harder to advance the goals, and really he brought an  energy, a new idea, and a lot of excitement.  We had 30 million Americans  vote for this ticket, and vote for Democrats, and we'll be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why hasn't he called the dogs off?  I mean, literally, why  hasn't he called the dogs off?  You've got thousands of protesters outside  right now.  Should he tell supporters, hey, go home, let's not disrupt this  convention. </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I don't think they are disrupting it.  We're going to go to  the floor.  We're going to elect her.  We're going to go forward.  And it's  going to be a very deep convention.  You're going to have two president  speaking.  First lady, Michelle Obama, who's speeches were so good, they  were even quoted at the Republican Convention.  And even Republicans are  coming out for Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Mayor Bloomberg has come out for  her. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he does.</p><p>MALONEY:  Larry Rockefeller has come out for her.  You'll see a strong  contingent of Republicans for Hillary Clinton.  And our compared, half the  people stayed home at the Republican Convention.  Our people are here. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Bloomberg is not really a Republican.  He was a Democrat  then a Republican, now he's independent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shape-shifting politicians. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You mention Republicans endorsing  Hillary Clinton.  You had Hank Paulson, George W. Bush secretary of  treasury.  Who architected the TARP bailout of Wall Street.  You have Dick  Armitage, who architected the Iraq war.  The Wall Street bailout and the  Iraq war aren't exactly assets to Bernie Sanders supporters who don't like  Hillary Clinton for that very reason.  It seems as if she's ideologically  been all over the map at her campaign is indicating that.  She's gone very  left is the primary, associating herself against stray now.  Obviously,  doing things like saying she's for the $15 minimum wage.  But her record  and even her, to your point, her endorsement indicates that she really is  still this kind of product of big establishment special interests.  How do  you reconcile that? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, she has a record of achievement and she is very consistent.   She is pro-America.  She's pro-American people.  Instead of building walls,  she'll be tearing down walls for opportunity for all Americans.  Her whole  career, and I've worked with her for 20 years, as First Lady she expanded  health care to 8 million American children.  And I was even with here in  Beijing when she gave that famous speech that's still quoted today that  women's rights are human rights.  She was the first major politician to  speak up to the Chinese government on human rights, and really transformed  the way women's issues are discussed.  They elevated it to a national  level.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take so many good points, but I got to push back because the  viewers are going to say when you talk about human rights why did she take  money from countries that treat women horribly like a Saudi Arabia?  When  you talk about the economy, wages haven't moved in 10 years.  President  Obama has not seen one year of 3 percent economic growth under his watch.   Most people are saying, wow, I'm worried that I'm going to lose my job.  My  friends are going to lose their job, 10 years after the financial crisis.   You look at Obamacare, that's the one issue that business managers continue  to bring up.  That's the reason that they're not hiring more people because  it's just too expensive.  Regulation has shut businesses to the extent that  they're not hiring or investing in anything.  We see the business part of  the economy unable to spend any new money.  So, when you say a record of  achievement, that's just the economy.  I could move on to national security  as well, ISIS has gotten stronger on her watch.  How is she going to  differentiate herself from all of these failures? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, we as Democrats are proud to speak about the record of  former president Clinton.  I didn't even hear George Bush's name mentioned  at the Republican Convention.  And when he left office, this country was  shedding 800,000 jobs a month.  He's last year in office they lost 4.5. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this is not about Bush.  This is Donald Trump or Hillary  Clinton. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALONEY:  Is about the economy, and policies that move this country forward  for all Americans.  And under President Obama we have seen consistent job  growth from that deep Republican valley to having gained 14.8 million  private sector jobs.  And a report that came out from Blinder at Princeton  shows the economy is consistently better under Democratic presence.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he's -- congresswoman, he's a Democrat, Alan Blinder. </p><p>MALONEY:  The stock market is up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SAYEGH:  The real people wages are down.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the wages -- but you have a.</p><p>MALONEY:  It's picking up the last two months.  And it's true we need to do  more in that area.  That's why she supports raising the minimum wage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fifteen dollars minimum wage.</p><p>MALONEY: . and supports growing small businesses, which are the major  employer for Americans in this country.  But if you compare the record, her  record is of solid achievement.  That's why she has earned the support of  Democrats, independents, Bernie Sanders.  She has earned the support of  many Republicans based on a record of helping people -- coping our economy.   She was part of the architect, and I would put her on this, on creating the  department of homeland security and creating anti-terrorism unit all across  our country, and reforming our whole system in -- of intelligence, which is  really the only way we can stop these attempts -- attempts on New York  since 9/11.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People don't trust her.</p><p>MALONEY:  But we stopped.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p><p>MALONEY:  Because of improved intelligence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, primarily.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, but voters don't trust her.  And you know her  personally, but the American people don't know her personally, and they  don't trust what they see, and they don't believe what she tell the  American people because she's lied to them before. </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, she has not, and she is trusted and she will be elected  president based on the merits.  She's not saying trust me, vote for me.   She's saying trust me look at my record, look what I've done, look at where  we're going, and this is how we're going to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  Pardon me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How surprised are you at how tight this race is?  You've got to  be just like, wow. </p><p>MALONEY:  I've got to tell you, I'm very surprised. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MALONEY:  But you've got to understand that I am a Hillary friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MALONEY: . and a fan and supporter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We understand.</p><p>MALONEY:  And the fact that they're so close is very surprising to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it's incredible.</p><p>MALONEY:  That's a 40-40.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MALONEY: . and 20 percent undecided. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why I asked you about independence.  Congressman, good  to see you.  Thank you so much, Congressman Maloney there.  Back in a  minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A fatal accident to report involving a Dallas  Cowboy's bus, Cheryl Casone with more and the headlines right now, Cheryl,  over to you. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWTORK:  Yeah, Maria, the bus which is a  fixture for Cowboys fans was carrying several team staffers when it  collided with a van on a Arizona highway about 180 miles northeast of  Phoenix.  Four people in the van were killed.  There were no Cowboy's  player on the bus, and none of the Cowboy staffers were injured.  They were  on their way to Las Vegas for a Cowboys fan event. </p><p>Well, switching gears, it was all about Star Trek Beyond this weekend, the  film coming in number one at the box office. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  No ship.  No crew.  How are we going to get out on  this one?</p><p>UINDENTIFIED MALE:  The impossible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The recent installment of the film series that tracks the journeys  of the Starship Enterprise, bringing in nearly $60 million in ticket sales,  knocking the Secret Life of Pets from the number one spot.  Tied for third  place with $21.6 million are Ghostbusters and Lights Out, and rounding up  the top five, Ice Age Collision Course.  And finally, I know its Monday, I  know it's early, you always hear that the booze is bad for you, so the  industry including some of the world's biggest makers of booze are rolling  out new drinks aim at consumers that want something healthy.  The Wall  Street Journal, big article about this today, says the new offerings will  include drinks that are gluten-free, vegan, all-natural or even alcohol  free.  Diageo, which of course is the world's largest spirit's maker,  recently announced that it's investing in a nonalcoholic distilled spirit,  they're calling it Seedlip.  Say that 10 times.  Maria, Seedlip, just to  let you know what this is, it's being use at a London bar to make a drink  that tastes like a gin and tonic, and -- but it's not.  Also on the menu,  non-alcoholic espresso martinis, and there's a lot more in the article, but  I don't have time to go to the whole list.  But, it's interesting.  Back to  you in Philadelphia. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Up next, no shortage of drama here at the Democratic National  convention this week.  Police are on high alert.  Protesters are taking to  the streets of Philadelphia, more on the escalating chaos at the convention  coming up.  And then later, cashing in on a 50 year rivalry, we are talking  to the owners in Philadelphia's iconic cheese steak shops, Philly cheese  steaks, how they're benefiting from the convention.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Police in Philadelphia are on high alert this week, preparing  for big protesters at the Democratic National Convention kicks off today.   Fox News Leland Vitter is on the ground on Philly with the very latest.   Leland, good morning to you. </p><p>LELAND VITTER, FOX NEWS:  Good morning to you, Maria.  We are on the  western front of the DNC complex, and the protest zone all is quiet, maybe  even silent over here.  To give you an idea the security preparations 4  miles of this stop they call no scale fencing, very difficult to get up.   And here by the protest zone they created a no man's land of sort here, so  if anybody is in the park protesting and tried to hop this red fence,  there's some defensible space here before getting in to the secure area.   This is Broad Street, the main drag world of protesters were yesterday.   There were more protesters out on Sunday at the DNC before it started, and  then at the RNC all week.  And they were angry about a couple things.  They  were talking a lot about the environment, and a lot about Bernie Sanders.  </p><p>Fired up, perhaps it's almost 100 degrees with the heat index out here, but  also because of the WikiLeaks e-mails saying this really proves what  they've been saying all along that the DNC and the primary process was  rigged and stacked against their man, Bernie Sanders.  Things yesterday  totally peaceful, that's in stark contrast to what everyone saw in 2000 at  the RNC in Philadelphia, when people were chaining themselves together and  then putting themselves across highway overpasses trying to disrupt rush- hour.  They certainly succeeded in disrupting rush-hour back in 2000.  So  far here haven't seen anything like that.  That, of course, though is the  big fear as we started rush-hour.  Number one of the DNC, Maria, whether  was the thunderstorms or people have just decided those aren't the tactics  they're going to use, things so far have been awfully quiet, back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Leland, thank you so much.  How will the protesting  impact a local business economy here in Philadelphia?  We want to bring in  the executive director of the greater Philadelphia chamber of commerce,  Matt Cabrey with us right now.  Matt, good to see you. </p><p>MATT CABREY, PHILADELPHIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR:  Great to  be here, Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  So, how big of an economic boost do you  think that the Democratic National Convention will be on filling in the  greater Philadelphia area? </p><p>CABREY:  Yes.  So this is significant, and that we expect to see an uptick  in some of what we call the expected industries.  You know, transportation,  tourism, hospitality sector, telecommunications, photography, event  production, things like that, but generally speaking we're managing  expectations well.  We'll definitely going to see an uptick compared to  last July, for example.  But we really could expect about a $300 to $400  thousand economic impact based on all the activities, because there are  costs associated with delivering a program like this as well.  So, it all  balances out.  The real upside is greater awareness.  When we get Greater  Philadelphia on the national and internationals stage it's really  beneficial.  So long-term, if we can get that message out about doing great  business in greater Philadelphia, it's really perfect. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in doing great business, you want to attract as many  businesses as possible.  How are you going to attract businesses to come up  and setup shop here in Philly? </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah, absolutely.  We reach out to them, we set up sessions, and  we basically articulate the great assets we have here, everything from our  talent, which is really key for us, to our transportation infrastructure,  our accessibility, our proximity.  Here's a great fun-fact for you, 60  percent of the U.S. population is accessible within two hours of Greater  Philadelphia, so if you're an industry that relies on distribution  channels, and you have goods and services that you're looking to  distribute, this is a great gateway into the Greater Philadelphia region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>CABREY: . for a European region company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this city.  It's a great city.  And you're right, it's  very accessible.</p><p>CABREY:  Absolutely. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Lots of fun. </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah.</p><p>SAYEGH:  We're enjoying it.  Thanks for the hospitality. </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah, absolutely.  Welcome. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said that some of the big revenue generators in the city  are what?  You said life-sciences. </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah.  Life-sciences is huge, and a lot of this goes back actually  to our history, so we are a very rich city as you know in history to which  our country was founded.  But it's also key to know that the first  hospital, the first university, the first pharmaceutical school was  establish here, and today that translates into a very robust R&amp;D life- sciences. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt, good to see you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>CABREY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt Cabrey joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, you're watching a special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

I can only speak to my campaign.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a  great shock to me. I think as I said, it's what we talked about six months  ago. I mean, there's no question in my mind and I think no question to any  objective observer's mind that the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This raising new questions this morning about party unity.  Sanders had to address the convention tonight and his supporters already  filling the streets, protesting all day yesterday and today expected. </p><p>Breaking news meanwhile.

Take a look at the  performances. We see the FJ, CAC 40, and DAX index, the German DAX index up  almost 1 percent. </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning. And here with me to break it  all down, Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, Maverick PAC national co- chair, Morgan Ortagus, and republican strategist, Tony Sayegh. </p><p>Good to see you, everybody. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shall we kick it off, we get here and the first thing is  distraction. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that how do democrats say unity? That's how you say unity  for democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God. But we've got that coming up. </p><p>To join us this morning we've got a great line up. Former adviser to  President Bill Clinton and author of \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat  Hillary,\" Dick Morris is with us this morning. </p><p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will join us. Congressman Caroline  Maloney will be here. Former astronaut, husband of former Representative  Gabriel Gifford, and co-founder of American for Responsible Solutions, Mark  Kelly is joining us this morning. And former Michigan Governor and senior  of Correct the Record, a super PAC67 backing Hillary Clinton, Jennifer  Granholm will be with us as well. </p><p>Disorder at the DNC this morning. A major shakeup rocking the Democratic  Party emitted in the e-mail scandal just hours before the Democratic  national Convention kicks in Philadelphia. </p><p>Let's get right to Blake Burman, he's here in Philly with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Maria. God morning to you  as well. Debbie Wasserman Schulz will gather in the Democratic National  Conventional later today. She'll give a speech at some point this week.  Gavel it out on Thursday and that will be it. </p><p>For her is that the Democratic National Committee as Wasserman Schultz  yesterday resigned from the top post at the DNC. Of course, this is due to  the fallout of the WikiLeaks scandal. WikiLeaks over the weekend releasing  some 19,000 plus e-mails that showed during the primary process. </p><p>Top democratic officials, some of them favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie  Sanders even in some states trying to tip the scales towards Clinton.  Wasserman Schultz herself even had some choice words when describing  Sanders campaign manager. </p><p>Now, Hillary Clinton was asked about those e-mails over the weekend, in an  interview with 60 Minutes. I should note that she gave this interview  before Wasserman Schultz officially submitted her letter of resignation.  Hear now Hillary Clinton about the e-mails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  I didn't know anything about it and I haven't read any of those.  But I am adamantly opposed to anyone bringing religion into our political  process. </p><p>Again, I don't know anything. I don't know anything about -- about these e- mails. I haven't followed it. But I'm very proud of the campaign that I  ran. </p><p>I can't speak to what people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were singing. I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Donald Trump as you might was not staying silent during all of  this. He had several responses via Twitter. Among them I'll read you one  here, quote \"Because the democrats are in a total meltdown, but the biased  media will say how great they are doing. E-mail say the rigged system is  alive and well.\" </p><p>Of course, Maria, Trump has been saying that the system was rigged against  Bernie Sanders. He will try to use this to try to sway some Sanders to his  side, and in something that you can't make up, Maria. The theme here  tonight for the democrats, \"United together.\" Ted Cruz and all of that was  so last week. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true. I mean, so much conversation about last week,  and yet here we are kicking this often and this happens. Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman with the latest there. </p><p>I want to bring in former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a former  presidential candidate himself and Fox News contributor. Congressman, good  to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your reaction to the e-mail scandal, WikiLeaks releasing  20,000 e-mails and that's obviously it came to life. </p><p>KUCINICH:  What reflects the culture inside the Democratic National  Committee. And as such, I think that when you add up all of the things,  setting the debate schedule that was insufficient, that super delegates.  There's so many things which basically prove that this election was rigged  against Bernie Sanders. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think, now -- we were talking on the commercial break. You  think Bernie Sanders should do more. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I actually think that it's time for him to consider  withdrawing the endorsement. Because it's not just about him, it's about  the movement that he represents which had 46 percent of the votes for the  country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And it was that kind of conduct was totally dismissive of almost  half of the democratic voters. And you cannot have that kind of contempt  for voters. And I think Bernie, I would -- I think he ought to at least  consider withdrawing the endorsement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we've been talking and hearing from the Democratic  National Committee yesterday as this is happening, Tony Sayegh. They kept  saying, well, he wasn't going to win anyway. But the truth is we'll never  know that for sure. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, doesn't that confirm the whole idea that it was rigged in  the first place.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to make that -- to make that...</p><p>SAYEGH:  And the evolution is crazy, Maria. You and I were together  yesterday morning. At that point, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has just said  she's not going to speak at the convention. </p><p>By the end of the day, and Bernie Sanders interview had I think a lot to do  it. She was out as the head of the DNC. But, Congressman, I agree with you.  I think Bernie Sanders should be strong and may be reconsidering his  endorsement. It doesn't sound like he's going to do that though. But it  sounds like his followers are pretty darn mad. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, they are. And, you know, as a former candidate for  president, I can tell you that, you know, you cannot expect the people who  support you to just go lockstep when then you say. And so that, you know,  there's the Bernie movement is a little bit separate from what the  candidate might want to do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And I want to go back to what you just said, Maria, where the  DNC's excuse was he wasn't going to win anyways. In other words, their  conduct, actually help to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where Bernie  was locked up because the game was rigged. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. And remember when we were watching all of those  democrats, we were all scratching our heads saying, why are they doing it  when the playoffs are on. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are they doing it on a Saturday night when no one watches - - or Sunday night. I mean, they were all very low, you know, viewing night  when they did these debates.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  But, Congressman, don't  you think this is immedicable larger cultural problem within the DNC  within, you know, when Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, this  the second e-mail scandal in the past year with the Democratic Party. </p><p>But don't you think that the party itself needs to look and say, you know,  we have a cultural leadership problem here where we're allowing this  cronyism to go on and fair tactics to go on that if the Republican Party  did, we'd be skewered for doing this. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, that is true. But let's go one step further. This is a  whole new era where technology is impacting politics in a powerful way. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  This is the millennial will understand this better than anyone.  Because you don't put anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't expect to  have to read publicly. And so, the politicians are just getting caught up. </p><p>And I think caught up and I think that what it reflects is an older  political culture that a pre-internet and it hasn't really caught up.</p><p>And so, again, but there has to be some kind of and say this is not right.  This kind of politics cannot be -- cannot be -- cannot continue. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Congressman, I suspect that this has disturbed you as much as it  disturb me and others. The idea that it was revealed they were  contemplating using Bernie Sanders religious beliefs...</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes. </p><p>SAYEGH:  ... as a campaign issue. And at the time where particularly as  republicans were often demonized by our opponents for being racist, being  bigoted in some fashion. Certainly our presidential candidate today is  assail by those things. </p><p>Doesn't that reveal hypocrisy that they were actually willing to do it  against their own? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I think it goes a little bit worse than hypocrisy. Here's  why. The head of the DNC, Jewish, OK. And probably so. An that's a good  thing. But how can you have under lengths trying to trap somebody, you  know, about his religion which also happens to be Jewish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  I mean, it boggles the mind. And so, this is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The cultural problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of -- the e-mails was -- one of the officials basically  saying somebody needs to ask him, do you even believe in God. And then he  said, look, my peeps in West Virginia are going to -- that will really  resonate with them, you know. Maybe he is an Atheist. Now he's Jewish. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, you know, the question now is that the DNC believe in  fairness? Does the DNC believe in the Constitution of the United States and  Freedom of Religion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  Does the DNC believe in trying to unite the party? </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I wouldn't be surprise to see two campaigns to have sort of e- mails going back and forth. But I think the crucial difference here is not  that these are two campaigns. This is the Democratic National Committee  overtly planning how to take one of their candidates. </p><p>KUCINICH:  There's no way to defend us. It's indefensible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tonight, Bernie Sanders will speak. Tonight, we'll see what  he says. We'll see if he addresses this. That's' going to be something to  watch.</p><p>KUCINICH:  he's going to need to address.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And Michelle Obama, the First Lady will speak tonight. So,  we will be obviously covering that. Congressman, good to see you. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. Congressman Kucinich there.  We will be live from the Democratic National Convention tonight in  Philadelphia all week. Don't miss our special primetime coverage, I'll here  that off tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern, followed by Lou Dobbs and Trish Regan.  So, do join us for our special coverage tonight. </p><p>Meanwhile, we are following the breaking news out of a nightclub shooting  in Fort Myers, Florida. At last two people are dead, 17 injured. We will  bring you the very latest from this deadly shooting in Florida. </p><p>Yahoo, meanwhile may have finally found a new home in Verizon. Reports say  Verizon is set to announce the nearly $5 billion deal this morning.  Interesting to know that back in the day Microsoft was willing to pay $48  billion. Verizon will pay 5 billion. Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. A fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub early  this morning to report. Cheryl Casone with the story and the other  headlines right now in our New York headquarters. Cheryl, good morning to  you. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria. Well,  officials say that at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others  injured in a shooting outside of a Florida nightclub. This happened just  after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.</p><p>Gunshots ring out in the parking lot and at this hour there are two active  crime scenes that we know off. Authorities say that injuries range from  minor to life-threatening at this hour. </p><p>Three people have been taken into custody and the investigation is  continuing right now. We'll bring updates if we get them, Maris.</p><p>Also this today, a deadly heat wave continuing to blanket parts of the  United States. Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona who died  from the heat as near triple digit temperatures sports state from New York  all the way to California. </p><p>Cody's mom was hiking in the snowy mountains when he suffered a fatal heat  strike. This happened in Phoenix, Arizona. Across the country, Maria,  temperatures got in 100 today, in particular in New York, Philadelphia, and  Washington. The heat index could be much higher if you combine the  temperature and humidity. </p><p>And finally, in business headlines this morning, the long process is over.  It appears that Verizon has come out on top in the biddings for Yahoo.  Reports said that Verizon has agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo. That  report includes Yahoo's core internet business and its finance news and  sports sides along with some real estate from the company. </p><p>Maria, the deal expected to be announced today. Take a look at buzz stock,  Yahoo right now, Maria. The stock is flat, the pre-market, but Verizon is  up just lately. Back to you in Philadelphia. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to bring in the  CIO of Recon Capital, chief investment officer, Kevin Kelly. Kevin, good to  see you. What are your thoughts on this deal? I think it's just so  extraordinary that back in, you know, back in the, what was it, early 2000,  Microsoft made a bid of -- a bid of $48 billion for Yahoo. And here we are  looking at a deal $4.8 billion or 5 billion. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS CEO:  Yes. You're bringing up a great  point. I mean, Marissa Mayer as well as other regimes have actually  decrease shareholder value pretty significantly for Yahoo. But what's nice  to know is that this is finally over. </p><p>Shareholders actually wanted Verizon to complete this deal. You can see  with the stock they really weren't attributing any value to this core  Yahoo. Yahoo right now when you look at the share price, it's really  factoring in Alibaba in its share price. </p><p>So, this is great news for shareholders because they now they can move on  with it. But, I mean, Marissa Mayer said she would not mess up. The Tumbler  rock was a shame. She said the sales process would go smoothly. It was  anything but people didn't know what was her sale. You could but this, or  you could buy that, including the real estate the patents they didn't know.</p><p>So, this is a good deal, especially for Verizon. So, they thought Yahoo was  going to hold them up on the sales process and actually ask for more, but  this is a fair price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin, let me ask you. The other technology earnings really  going to be in headlines this week. That Apple coming out with earnings.  You've got Google parent Alphabet coming out. And I believe Amazon, is that  going to set the tone. What are you expecting from some of these high- profile tech names this week? </p><p>KELLY:  That will set the tone this week, especially when you actually have  over a dozen central banks making actions including the Federal Reserve  here. People are going to focus on the largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 and  that is tech. </p><p>So, people are going to start seeing how these managements are going to  guide going forward. When you look at the tech sector, it provides the  largest growth out of any sector as well. It has net cash on the balance  sheets so people are going to start going into these names if you start to  see dividends increase in the tech sector, which could be great for the  market this week. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. It's all about -- it's all about earnings and it's  about guidance, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes. And I wanted to just point out Marissa Mayer, she gets  terminated with this acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon. She gets $50 million.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's already earned 100 million in cash and other compensation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, it's a sweet payday for basically driving the company into  the ground. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fifty million.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Kevin.</p><p>Coming up, democratic party leaders facing outrage ahead of the convention  over leaked e-mails. And the Clinton campaign is pointing the fingers at  Russia. Russian hackers, that's next.</p><p>And then if you're in the market to buy a home, maybe it's fair to act  fast. Homes are selling faster than a year earlier. What you should do to  win the housing wars, straight ahead.</p><p>Back in a moment on Mornings with Maria, live from Philadelphia at the  Democratic National Convention.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. </p><p>Hillary Clinton reacting to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S.  diplomatic compound in Benghazi. That ahead of today's kickoff to the  Democratic national Convention. </p><p>Here's what she said in an interview to 60 Minutes last night when asked  about her responsibility there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  So, when this happened in Benghazi, I immediately stood up an  independent committee, distinguished Americans from the military civilian  experts. They came out and they said, you know, the ball was dropped in  security. And, you know, some of the decisions that were made probably  should have been rethought. </p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT:  But wasn't that your ball to  carry? </p><p>CLINTON:  No, it wasn't. It was not my fault to carry. It was there with --  read the -- read the reports. Read all of the reports all many hundreds of  pages of them including this latest one, which was a political exercise  from the very beginning. Those never reached me. Those never came to my  attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, Pete  Hegseth. He's also a Fox news contributor. Pete, your reaction to that.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, IRAQ &amp; AFGHANISTAN VETERAN:  Good morning. The reaction is  she continues to be sort of arrogantly dismissive of the entire team.  She'll say immediately, yes, I had some responsibility but no  responsibility. It never reached my level. </p><p>And I wish Scott Pelley had asked the real question about, well then why  did you lie to people, that to me the biggest scandal. </p><p>For a week afterwards you lied about what you knew to be the real reason  for the attack. But there was a political expedient narrative that you push  forward. He never asked that follow up question. I think she needs to  continue to be asked that question. Because she has no answer. </p><p>The evident shows she told her daughter one thing and then lied to the  families of the fallen and said something else. She has never taken  responsibility for this and never taken it seriously. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. I mean, you would think -- I mean, this was September 11,  2012. And they had this whole narrative that there was a video, and then  they sent Susan Rice out there on all the Sunday shows. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to his point, the most disgusting thing about it which she  still won't own is that the she told the family...</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... that very lie that was cooked up by the administration for  political purposes. And then when she talks about in the interview, it was  not my ball to carry in terms of the security... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's fault was it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... in the program. Right. You're running -- again.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's the Secretary of State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was the Secretary of State, how did you operate. how did you  behave in that leadership post and you expect the American people to vote  you to run the nation. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And then, you know, in any leader and organization when something  goes wrong the buck should stop with the leader. And this is what I was  talking to earlier about my point of this culture within her campaign in  the DNC. </p><p>That I think the story would have been a lot sooner if she would have just  said I was the Secretary of State, ultimately it's my responsibility. But  the fact that she still can't take any responsibility as why this narrative  keeps going and going and going. And I don't know why she doesn't get it.  You're in charge, take responsibility. </p><p>HEGSETH:  That's exactly right. Leaders assert themselves in times of  difficulty not fade to the background which is exactly what she did hiding  behind other people. There's a scandal before this current scandal during  Benghazi and the scandal afterwards is what we still need to pin her down  on because she's never been able to explain why she lied. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And no one will forget the famous quote at this point when she  was testifying to Congress what difference does it make at this point. </p><p>Let me move on to this WikiLeaks dump of 20,000 e-mails. Hillary Clinton's  campaign is pointing fingers at Russian hackers for the DNC e-mail scandal  ahead of the convention. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is disturbing to us is that we, experts are  telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these e- mails. And other experts are now saying that they are -- the Russian are  releasing these e-mails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump. </p><p>I don't think it's coincidental that these e-mails were released on the eve  of our convention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know. To help Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They have theories that Donald Trump is pro-Putin and as a result  Putin state actors are working to poured out e-mails to the DNC. Again,  they're trying to obfuscate confuse create a counter narrative for the  irresponsibility and their inability to secure...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's still on tough election right now. Putin is in re-election  at the moment which is quite tough, you know, in Russia? So, I think he has  his own affairs to worry about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She still insists which she went of her way to point out in the  60 Minutes interview that her e-mail server, that her e-mails weren't  compromise. Well, we'll wait and see if that's the case because if the  server was hacked you know those e-mails are going to show up.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, but this whole leak is so really dangerous for the  DNC because the truth is now everything they say, I don't know, people are  questioning. Because it's like, well, you just created a narrative yourself  that Bernie Sanders might not be Jewish and then he's an Atheist. </p><p>So, now I'm going to believe this new narrative that you've just come up  with that Donald Trump is behind somehow this DNC leaked? I mean, it's hard  to believe anything now. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Indeed. And from the media as well as you see collusion with the  media on the stories they're running in by Politico and elsewhere. Hey,  does this make sense. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Vogel for Politico actually showed them his story before he  published. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes. But, doesn't it fit the narrative that Donald Trump is that  they're lying to you? That it's all of a fussed; this is exactly what this  does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I feel I love the fact that one woman in the Democratic Party  lost her job over an e-mail scandal and another one gets nominated to run  for president. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. All right. We will -- well, there you go. Pete and Dagen,  great insights. Pete Hegseth there.</p><p>A rocky start to the Democratic National Convention for sure as protesters  take to the streets before the official kick off. </p><p>More on what to expect live on the ground from Philly. And then wildfires  sweeping California this morning sparking massive evacuations. More with  the measures the state is talking to cope.</p><p>We're back in a moment. We're live from the Democratic National Convention  here in Philadelphia. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Once again, here is Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN:  Good Monday morning everybody, welcome back.  I am  Maria Bartiromo.  It is Monday, July 25th.  Your top stories right now,  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Democrats in disarray DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz losses her job  after leaked e-mails show that the committee worked behind scenes against  Bernie Sanders.  Wasserman Schultz's counterpart, Reince Priebus, wade in  on controversies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  Today's events  show I think really want an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week  in unifying their party and starting out the week by losing your party  chairman over longstanding bitterness between fractions is no way to keep  something together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The conflict raising new questions about party unity to insure  Sander set to address the convention tonight, and protesters and Sanders  supporters are already filling the streets here in Philly.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Southern California, a massive wildfire grows rapidly.

As you  can see, things have turned negative, but just by a fraction.  So Dow  Industrials now indicated lower by about two points.</p><p>Later this week, investors will have a lot to digest between a host of  economic data like the GDP report is out at the end of the week, and a  number of high profile earnings news coming out.</p><p>In Europe, this morning stocks are higher across the board, take a look.   Well, not across the board.  The FT 100 is actually down at 10 points, but  things have improved in the Eurozone, Cac Quarante in Paris up half a  percent, Dax index in Germany up almost 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia, overnight mixed performances, as you can see here, also just  fractional moves as well.</p><p>The city of Philadelphia prepping for expected protests today, as the  Democratic National Convention kicks off.  Key speakers tonight include  first lady, Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Fox News's Doug McKelway is live in Philly with a preview.  Doug, good  morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Morning Maria, and there's been a bit of breaking  news from the Democratic National Convention this morning.  They have  announced that the keynote speaker for tonight will be Massachusetts  Senator Elizabeth Warren.  This is probably a very, very sound decision by  the DNC.</p><p>As you know, Elizabeth Warren has been an attacked dog nipping at heels of  Donald Trump.  Throughout this campaign she goes head-to-head with him in  Twitter wars, and matches insult for insult.  And so, in that sense, it  will probably a very -- be a very effective strategy in trying to divert  attention from the story DuJour of the Democratic National Convention.  The  story of the convention, thus far, which is the e-mail scandal and the  resignation of Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p><p>She has come to a bit of a soft landing in the sense.  She has been picked  up by the Clinton campaign to serve as an honorary co-chairman.  But the  damage has been done, and her resignation is something that had to be done,  because -- simply to see her coming out on this stage, you know, walk out  on a daze (ph) in front of all these delegates to face a chorus of boos in  a way that Ted Cruz faced, of course, the boos when is he failed to  introduce Donald Trump and to support Donald Trump at the Republican  convention.  Something they did not want to see repeated here.</p><p>Clinton has been successful in alienating herself from the scandal as well  as she told \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE:  I don't know anything about these e- mails, I haven't followed it.  But I am very proud of the campaign that I  ran.  I can't speak to people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were saying, I can't speak to that.  I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  For his part, Bernie Sanders has remained remarkably calm  throughout this scandal.  His convention speech also scheduled to be  delivered tonight.  Will be chock-full of insults directed at Donald Trump,  compliments directed towards Hillary Clinton but he won't be firing away  from within the Democratic tent, perhaps because he is long suspected a  conspiracy to deprive him of the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a great shock to  me.  It's what we talked about six months ago.  I mean, there's no question  to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that  the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton, was in opposition to our campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Those allegiances of Bernie Sanders supporters are not being as  gentle as that thousands gathered on the streets of downtown Philadelphia  yesterday to protest.  It was a larger gathering than anything we saw.</p><p>In Cleveland, albeit, it was a peaceful demonstration.  They'll be moving  up to this neck of the woods today about 20 miles north of where they  protested yesterday to FDR Park.</p><p>The impressive thing about their appearance there yesterday was, they came  out in intense heat and humidity, did not dissuade them did at all.  Today,  a different situation, we had downpours here in Philadelphia.  We'll see if  they've been able -- if they will be able to withstand that.  Maria, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug thanks so much.  Doug McKelway there -- here in  Philly with us.  How will the DNC e-mail leak impact day one and the views  of delegates and voters.</p><p>I want to bring in former advisor to President Bill Clinton and co-author  of the new book, \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat Hillary\" and that is, of  course, Dick Morris.  Dick, good to see you.</p><p>DICK MORRIS, ARMAGEDDON AUTHOR:  Good to be here with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think?  What's the impact of all this?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think that it's notable that Trump went out of his way to  appease the conservatives in his party who he largely defeated by naming  Pence.  And Hillary went out of her way to name Kaine, who is clearly not a  liberal and does nothing to placate Sanders and Warren.</p><p>So when Sanders and Warren addressed the convention tonight, the big thing  we'll notice is that they would not chosen to be vice president.  And in a  sense -- no matter how attractive they are, people are saying that shows  that their views and Hillary's are fundamentally different.  So I think it  really casts a shadow over the whole thing.  But, you know Maria, it can  get worse.  When .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you mean it can -- how is it going to get worse?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, when a bomb hits you, you wonder if the plane is still  overhead.  And on June 14th, there was a leak from anonymous sources in  Russia, probably the Kremlin, that they possessed a number of Hillary's  state department e-mails.  And that they may release them at a time that  might be inconvenient to Hillary, and that's something to keep your eye on  all convention.  Because that would establish that the e-mail server was  hacked and was hacked by our enemies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  That's really interesting, Dagen, because this whole  time she is saying we weren't hacked, everything is fine.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Which in the interview with \"60 Minutes\"  she went out of her way to make that point and put an exclamation on the  discussion about that very e-mail server.</p><p>I want to ask Dick this in terms of a Tim Kaine picked The Wall Street  Journal editorial page, essentially says that Tim Kaine is a pick for when  she wins, so -- and when she begins to govern, that she seems to be so  confident in getting the far left vote, and in getting the votes that -- of  Sanders or Warren would appeal to, that she's basically skipping November  and going right to governing starting in January with Tim Kaine.</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I can't think that she is that na[ve.  I think there's a  different explanation for Tim Kaine.  You're right.  It's confounding as a  political proposition.  But I think that the key is Tim Kaine's letter that  he sent to the banks three days before he was nominated, avowing that he  would opposed stricter regulation of the big banks.</p><p>Now, normally when you're on a short list for V.P. you keep your mouth  shut.  But he overtly sent that letter, and I think it was to get the banks  to lobby Hillary to put him on the ticket.  And I think that what you are  seeing here is Hillary reassuring her financial controllers that she's  still on the reservation by picking Kaine.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PACK NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Dick, good morning.  This  is Morgan.  I'm wondering, what can Bernie Sanders say tonight?  And the  comparison that I'm thinking it was four years ago, Bill Clinton sort of  saved Barack Obama in his reelection by giving that powerful speech at the  convention.  Do you expect Bernie Sanders to pull a Bill Clinton four years  ago or a Ted Cruz last week when it comes to Hillary Clinton tonight?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think it will be a Bernie.  And I think he will use the  opportunity to articulate again his points of view.  I think he'll attract  Trump aggressively.  I think he'll mildly praise Hillary.  But I think that  the real point here is that his voters are the swing the vote in this  election.</p><p>Try to make that point in -- on again, in my book.  The Republicans can run  not just with the right jab, doing the conservative issues but they need to  throw a left hook coming around Hillary and talking to the Sanders voters  in the rear.  And I think Trump did a very good job of that in his speech.   And I think this e-mail scandal and the choice of Kaine both of which  essentially to have lifted the Democratic Party to stop it, really  undermine Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's been trying to do that.  You know, Trump trying to reach  out to those Bernie Sanders voters and Hillary is being forced to defend  the multiple scandals surrounding her and her entire political record.  She  gave that first interview with the V.P. choice Senator Kaine, and Clinton  claimed that she is judged on a different standard than others are judged.   Listen to this Dick Morris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I think that it is fair to say there has been a concerted effort  to convince people like that young man of something.  Nobody is quite sure  what but of something.  I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and  then there's the standard for everybody else.</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, \"60 MINUTES\" HOST:  What's the Hillary standard?</p><p>CLINTON:  Well, it is, you know, a lot of as you saw at the Republican  Convention, unfounded, inaccurate, main spirited attacks with no basis in  truth reality which take on a life of their own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORRIS:  Well .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think?  Is there a Hillary standard?</p><p>MORRIS:  I'm glad his speech writer didn't call it a vast right-wing  conspiracy.  May be they used that one already.  But I think that -- yeah,  when somebody comes out of a bar at night, they had a nice drink.  When the  guy has five DUI (ph), there's a question to whether they shouldn't have  been in that bar in the first place, and that is the Hillary standard.</p><p>But I think that it is -- when we look at this convention, Donald Trump  used this convention to show who Donald Trump is.  He was front and center  of his family, his wife, his kids.  Hillary is going to use this convention  to hide herself.  She is not running.  The first woman is running.  She's  not running, pro-choice is running and pro-gun control.  She's the only  person between Donald Trump and the presidency.</p><p>And in .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great analysis, yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  . in fact she advances through generic rather than through the  specific of her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, that's a great point.  You know, and maybe (ph) she might  also have created that standard for herself by just doing things like, oh,  I am going to -- you have my own e-mail server, because that's what I'm  going to do and nobody else can do that.</p><p>TONY SAYEGH, JAMESTOWN ASSOCIATES:  The most of these in part of that  interview was she said that all these concerns about her honesty  untrustworthiness were baseless.  Meanwhile, we know from the Clinton  Foundation contribution for foreign government, the server and et cetera,  but Delegates County saying, you've known Hillary Clinton for decades.  You  advise the Clintons a long time ago.  Has Hillary changed or is this the  same Hillary you sat down with face to face when you first met the  Clinton's back.  I believe it was in the 80's.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  Real quick, Dick.</p><p>MORRIS:  I think best say to say it, she's metastasized.  In the beginning,  there was the incipient dishonesty, there was the incipient paranoia and  secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  There was the incipient dishonesty corruption but it's grown.   It's metastasized.  It's taken her over.  You know a person from 70 years  old, you knew when they were 30, and you could see them going off the track  but not that much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  But then a 60s and 70s you say, oh, my god, look at what they've  become, that's Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know them really well.  And Dick, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MORRIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, quite morning in terms of futures.  Take a look,  we're really not far from where the market finished the day yesterday, and  yet earnings really driving the story.  Handful of names on the new this  morning.</p><p>SolarCity is (inaudible) higher.  The company reportedly closed to emerge  their deal with Tesla.  Reuters is reporting that the two companies are in  final stages of talks in carrying out due diligence on a potential deal.   Stock as you can see looking higher.</p><p>Well, the initial report of the deal came out last month.  Questions were  raised because Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and the Chairman of SolarCity.   Musk has refused himself from voting on this deal.</p><p>We'll continue to track the latest development following a fatal explosion  in Germany yesterday.   Cheryl Casone with that right now and the other  head lines from our New York headquarters.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yeah, that's right Maria.  The various  interior minister says he believes the incident was likely an Islamist  suicide attack.  Police say a 27-year old Syrian man blew himself up after  he was turned away from an open air music festival in Ansbach.</p><p>Police believe the man who killed himself was motivated after being denied  asylum in Germany.  He was already known to them for a recent drug  misdemeanor.  At least 12 others were injured in the suicide attack.</p><p>We'll here at home.  A wildfire in Southern California, destroying 18 homes  and rapidly gaining straight two days after it broke out.  The fire being  described as a freight train by some setting so much smoke into the air  that planes making water drops on it, had to be grounded (ph) at one point.   Thousands of people forced to evacuate.</p><p>This fire Maria has burned at least 34 square miles but fire officials say  that size may now have doubled.  Of course, it's dark in California.  We'll  see what happens when the sun comes up this morning.</p><p>And finally, the housing market, showing signs of improvement.  (Inaudible)  said that homes are selling an average of a week faster than they did just  one year ago.  This is the supply of nearly 5 percent lower than last year.   Homes are being sold after about 78 days on the market.  The average U.S.  home is currently worth $187,000, Maria, that's a 5.4 percent increase from  June of last year.  That's for prices from 2015.</p><p>But Maria, remember, that we're also looking about 3.5 percent for the 30- year fixed year mortgage right now, that's also affecting sales.  Back to  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Spotlight on technology  this week, setting the stage on market.  Coming up, we're going to preview  the week.  We'll tell you what to expect, out of a whole host (ph) of  earnings within the tech sector.</p><p>Plus, we're coming to you live from Democratic National Convention here in  Philadelphia.  We'll tell about what to expect as the DNC kicks off today.   Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's check market this morning with a lot of  earnings coming out this weekend some economic data that will certainly set  the tone and the Fed.  Two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve is having this  week.</p><p>Ahead of all of that, the market is looking fractionally higher.  It keeps  going back and forth though between positive and negative territory, this  following another record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Investors are gearing up for a slow of Vect (ph) technology earning  including S&amp;P components, Apple which is also a Dow component, reporting  earnings  tomorrow.  Facebook is out on Wednesday.  Amazon is out and Google parent  Alphabet are out with their results on Thursday.</p><p>This is going to be a big week.  You also have a two-day Federal Reserve  meeting which ends on Wednesday.  We're not going to see rates move higher  but we're going to be focused on the language out of the Fed, and what they  say or suggest about the next meeting.</p><p>Recon Capital Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Kelley with us standing by in  our New York studios.  Technology earnings should set the tone, what do you  expect on earnings?  Is the Fed a factor?  What drives market this week,  Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN KELLEY, RECON CAPITAL CIO:  It's going to be a very, very wild week  especially for the Nasdaq 100.  You're going to have about 40 percent of  the companies reporting this week alone.  So that's going to dictate a lot  of the market action.</p><p>And as you alluded to earlier, the big tech names are really going to drive  that but also biotech will be reporting this week as well.  And you're  seeing a lot of these names, are big growers in their space, except for  Apple.  Apple is expected to have 22 to 25 percent revenue decline and  that's because of the refreshed cycle on the iPhone.</p><p>So, we're going to have to see where software and services going that route  but you're seeing all the other names including Facebook, Amazon.  You're  seeing their growth be pretty significant, above 20 percent on the top line  revenue growth and 15 percent on the earnings growth.</p><p>So people are really going to be focused on that, because companies are  going to give their guidance, but it's expected to do very well.  And these  are companies that are giving a good value.  So when you look at the tech  sector alone, it's training in a 20 perfect discount to its forward  earnings on a historical basis.  So, people maybe getting into this and  really actually help make this sector move higher and move the overall  market higher this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even Amazon?  That's the company that's -- not going to cover  up the flow (ph), right Dagen?  That stock is up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Price is up -- maybe price for perfection and the question is,  in terms of the forward-looking earnings are those estimates wrong?  Do  they need to come down because that made -- that could make the stocks not  look like .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not beating (ph) against Amazon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Apple is down 6 percent this year.  It really  fell off a cliff.  It's come back a little bit but in terms of potential  upside there, I've heard people talking about that.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yeah .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With Amazon -- yeah.</p><p>KELLEY:  It's really limited upside on Apple but -- just so you know on the  Amazon front, Amazon is a great company that hasn't really focused on  earnings.  They've really focused on revenue growth.  So when people start  talking about a fundamental basis and their earnings, you can't focus on  that, because what they could do is they could actually slash all of their  expenditures and really make it into a great value stock if they wanted to  but they're not focused on that.  That's why you're seeing in perform  quarter over quarter on a basis.  That's why you're seeing lead even in the  Cloud space.</p><p>So, their Amazon is going to be a company that ends up being a Cloud  company that happens to have an eCommerce platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  You know what?  Investors have not been bothered by that  that they focus on revenue growth.

Kevin, any other highlights from your standpoint?   Do you care about the Fed, Tuesday, Wednesday?</p><p>KELLEY:  I don't think the Fed is really muted right now especially because  people are not expecting a move, and if they are expecting a move they're  looking it to be in December or early next year.  So people -- investors  aren't really focused on that, and they're not even focused on the bank of  Japan either because of the move last month.</p><p>So, people were going to be focused on the market.  Yup, exactly.  All  about earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I think (ph) the Japan, is on Friday.  All right, Kevin,  thank you.</p><p>We are awaiting big news this morning form month all about earnings from  Verizon reports out that say it is going to be completing inking a $5  billion deal to acquire Yahoo.

Another shooting at a nightclub in  Florida.  At least two people have been killed, seventeen others injured.</p><p>Authorities are searching for suspects, we have the latest details coming  up.  A dangerous heat wave ripping half of the country. </p><p>A look at when temperatures will begin to drop coming up.  And then the  deal of the day, Verizon acquiring Yahoo for a value of $4.8 billion.</p><p>Yahoo shares down in the pre-market, what it means for CEO Marissa Mayer's  future coming up. </p><p>Markets moving fractionally this morning, edging higher, take a look at  what we're looking at, at the open. </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open up just about 9 points  this morning, fractional moves.</p><p>Later in the week, a whole host of things that the market will get impacted  from.  Investors will have a lot to digest this week between economic data,  a two-day Fed meeting, a Bank of Japan meeting and a lot of earnings  particularly coming out of the tech sector. </p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are higher, take a look, we are looking at  gains pretty much across the board.  The Dax index in Germany up about 1  percent, leading index there.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, mixed performances as you will see fractional moves,  not too far from where they began the session. </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, and joining me to talk about it  is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Maverick PAC National Co-Chair  Morgan Ortagus and Republican strategist Tony Sayegh.</p><p>Great show so far, you guys. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Lots of fun -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Fun, Maria, thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  It's a crazy start -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot happening -- and it really is just day one. </p><p>SAYEGH:  You know, what's crazy? There is a thunder and rainstorm earlier - - </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes, I know -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Over our pavilion here, and that's the analogy for the Democratic  Convention with the resignation of their chair -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Here on the first day -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The 4 mile, 8-foot high fence that is very Trumparian(ph) if you  will.  So, you know what? A wall is OK when it's to protect Democrats, but  not the American people who don't agree with him politically.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Can you imagine -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They built a wall, that's true.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Maybe just -- can you imagine if a week ago Reince Priebus was  resigning on Monday?</p><p>I mean, it's just -- it's really -- it's -- I don't think this has ever  happened before. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And maybe Debbie Wasserman Schultz won't mock people on Twitter  like she did Reince where she offered -- she was like another chair is in  town in Cleveland last week -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where she essentially mocked him -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  He did -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Came back -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Said it didn't help him here -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it came back to bite her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, all these stories coming up this hour, we have a  can't-miss line up, do stay with us.</p><p>We will be speaking with former astronaut and Gabrielle Giffords' husband  Mark Kelly will join us.</p><p>Plus, former Michigan Governor and senior adviser of a Super PAC backing  Hillary Clinton, Jennifer Granholm is with us this morning.</p><p>And Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney will weigh in, you don't want to  miss a moment of it.  So, do stay with us for a big hour ahead. </p><p>There's in fact this raid for Democrats as the convention kicks off today.   The party chairwoman wish to resign amid an e-mail leak. </p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway, McKelway is live in the Wells Fargo Arena right  now with a preview.  Doug, over to you. </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Actually, we stepped outside now, Maria, because  it stopped raining.  But we have just learned that the keynote speaker at  tonight's opening session of the convention will be Massachusetts Senator  Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>This is a good choice for the Democrats because she may be very effective  in deflecting all the attention from the crisis which has engulfed this  convention. </p><p>She's been an excellent foil to Donald Trump, withstanding his Pocahontas  blows while matching him tweet for tweet and insult for insult.</p><p>So, look for her to fire away at Donald Trump tonight.  That said, the e- mail scandal and the Wasserman Schultz's resignation hangs as thick over  this convention as the Summer humidity. </p><p>Hillary Clinton told \"60 Minutes\" last night that she is no way involved in  this crisis. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  I didn't know anything about  it, and I haven't read any of those.  But I am adamantly opposed to anyone  bringing religion into -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes -- </p><p>CLINTON:  Our political process.  I mean, the constitution says no  religious test.  So, that is just absolutely wrong and unacceptable. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCKELWAY:  It is strange then that the Clinton campaign has announced that  Wasserman Schultz will be brought on board as a \"honorary chairman of the  Clinton campaign.\"</p><p>So, Clinton is not distancing herself from the leader of the organization  that brought on this embarrassment to start with. </p><p>Bernie Sanders however wants nothing to do with her and that is a sentiment  where she has been expressing for a long time. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT:  I asked and demanded Debbie Wasserman  Schultz's resignation many months ago.  I don't think she is qualified to  be the chair of the DNC. </p><p>Not only for these awful e-mails which revealed the prejudice of the DNC,  but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and  young people, and I don't think her leadership style is doing that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Bernie Sanders is also among those speaking tonight, as is  Michelle Obama, and an array of union presidents from the SEIU from ASME  and the American Federation of Teachers.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug, thank you so much, let's take a look at one of  those e-mails in that DNC dump-leak, Wasserman Schultz responding to  Sanders complaint that the party has not been fair to him.</p><p>\"Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party  and has no understanding of what we do.\"</p><p>My next guest is set to speak at the Democratic National Convention,  joining me right now is former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm. </p><p>She is also the senior adviser to Correct the Record; a PAC supporting  Hillary Clinton.  Governor, it's nice to see you. </p><p>JENNIFER GRANHOLM, FORMER MICHIGAN GOVERNOR:  Great to be on -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For joining us.  </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First of, I want to ask you about policy, what we're going to  hear this week from the convention for sure.</p><p>But first, there is speculation that you are going to ultimately take over  and become the head of the Democratic National Committee.  Is that true?</p><p>GRANHOLM:  No, that's news to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  That's news to me, I have not talked with anybody on the  campaign about that.  </p><p>And we've got Donna Brazile who is taking over on an interim basis,  although frankly, she would be sad to list on a long-term basis as well  because everybody loves Donna Brazile.</p><p>There are a lot of good people I'm sure who could do that job.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't want the job? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, I have not talked with anybody about that, it's -- you  know, so, it's just not in my -- is not my -- necessarily in my future. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me ask you this, governor, because you know,  Hillary Clinton has her supporters and -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are loyal supporters.  Donald Trump has his supporters,  and he's got some loyal supporters as well.  Then there's this huge block  of independents.  That's what I want to ask you about today. </p><p>What are you -- what do you think we will hear from this convention next  week, that's actually going to attract those independents? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, I think first of all, she's got to really make this case  about her economic plans affecting in a positive way the lives of real  people. </p><p>And the fact is independents who are not aligned with parties often are  really looking to hear what people are going to do for them. </p><p>And she's got very specific strategies to be able to -- you know, this is a  business network, business show, right? </p><p>To be able to make sure that businesses are able to make the choice to  manufacture advanced products in the United States.</p><p>To be able to support the growth of jobs in the U.S. and the global  economy.  She's got very specific strategies on clean energy and making  sure that those products are made in the U.S. and we're able to export. </p><p>She's got specific strategies on raising people's incomes, so that the  economy does better.  And I think you'll hear about -- I mean, starting  with tonight, tonight is the -- the theme is about children families and  how she help support families. </p><p>But it's really about how she hopes to better individual's economies which  obviously helps families.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this is what I don't understand, and you have to connect  the dots for us.</p><p>Because when you hear some of these policies in terms of what you're saying  right now, it doesn't jive with what you would think actually does increase  economic growth.</p><p>So, I mean, the big issue -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  What do you mean? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I'll tell you right -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now.  Raising wages is going to make it harder for small  business.</p><p>Building on Obamacare is going to make it more expensive for small  business.  Raising taxes on the highest earners is going to  impact small  business. </p><p>How does that lead to economic growth? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, you want to be able to make sure that people have the  ability to buy the products.  And so, making sure that everybody grows,  that we are all in this together.</p><p>That you -- if you -- if you can't even -- if you're making $900 a week  because you are earning a minimum wage, you're bringing home $900 a month,  you know, how can you afford to buy any of the products? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  How can you afford to buy any of the services? So, you want to  make sure that everybody has a chance to succeed.  And she has a total  comprehensive plan on small businesses.</p><p>Making sure they have access to capital, making sure we're supporting small  business growth.  She wants to be the small business president, so, she's  really listened to them about what it would take for them to be able to  succeed. </p><p>She's got -- she knows that there are changes that need to happen within  the Affordable Care Act.  But she also knows that she's not going to put  all of that burden on to businesses like it was in the past where you had  businesses who were picking up the full tap for people's healthcare.  You  want to have a shared responsibility for it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think you make a really good point.  But when we speak  with people like the head of a franchise for McDonald's or the head of a  small business, and we have these guys and girls on a lot.</p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say, look, raising the minimum wage to $15 on a national  level is going to create real pressure for me.  It might put us out of  business, it might put us towards bankruptcy, and yes, we will be cutting  jobs. </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, so, you want to make sure though that people who -- if  you're not making enough money to be even able to afford your rent because  you are making $7 and some change an hour, you're not going to be able to  see those people at McDonald's buying food. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about leaving it to -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The states? I mean, that's what -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Donald Trump said, leave it to the states. </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, he doesn't even want to have a minimum wage at all. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  That's all -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said he's not against raising the wage, but leave it to the  states to -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Yes, but he's also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Decide, because everybody has a different income.</p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, he's also the guy who has said that wages may be too high.   So, honestly, you need to be able to balance it, so that people who are  going to buy your products have the means to be able to do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  And you're responsible in allowing some movement at the state  level.  She has said, obviously, that she'd like to see the states take  these actions.</p><p>But she knows that in recent things are a little bit different. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he did say that he thought $7 was too low actually, is  what Donald Trump said.  But let me ask you this -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, he's not advocating for an increase in it, that's for  sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said leave it to the states, is what he said, leave it to  the -- I asked Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she was favoring Hillary  Clinton.  This was -- this was back in March.  Listen to what she said, I  want to get your reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CHAIRPERSON, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:   There's just no shred of evidence to suggest that I'm favoring Hillary  Clinton. </p><p>I am running -- if I were -- Maria, if I wanted to go -- not doing a very  good job wrapping the nomination up for her if I were actually favoring  Hillary Clinton.  I could have worked a lot harder at it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think these leaked e-mails contradict that statement? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Well, you know, the question is, are the e-mails from her or are  they from staff members? </p><p>You know, obviously -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  The Democratic National Committee is comprised of a whole lot of  staff members who have relationships on both sides. </p><p>There were some that were against Hillary Clinton, some that were against  Bernie Sanders.  The bottom line is it's the states that decide, it is the  voters in the states who decide it who is going to be the nominee.</p><p>And I don't think any of those e-mails had any impact on the outcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, let me ask you now about the trust factor.</p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know this has been one of the biggest issues -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  For sure -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For Hillary Clinton, right? People say, they don't trust her,  she lied.</p><p>How is she going to change that, you know, perception out -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There? What are we going to hear because one of the things that  people are saying is, we're going to hear who the real Hillary Clinton is  this week. </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, I mean, that is going to be part of the strategy because  there's -- you know, she has this image out there, and the Republicans  certainly just last week spent all of their time hammering her. </p><p>And so that you would think that she is this horrible monster.  People need  to hear from people who know her personally and who have been impacted by  her personally. </p><p>So, you're going to hear a lot of real people who have stories about  Hillary Clinton and how -- what she did helped them out, as well as people  who know her. </p><p>And that's going to start tonight.  They're going to have all these big  names, speaking obviously.  You got Michelle Obama -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Tonight -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's tonight -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  You got Bernie Sanders tonight, you have Cory Booker tonight -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Elizabeth Warren -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Elizabeth Warren which is great, that's really important for the  base.  But what's really important is sort of the stuff that happens in  between.  I hope you guys cover some of the smaller features -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  You know, smaller in the sense of less time because they will  tell the story of Hillary Clinton. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, do you think the party has changed, I mean, from Barack  Obama to Elizabeth Warren to Bernie Sanders all the way to the left? Has  this party become much more to the left? </p><p>GRANHOLM:  I think the party platform is the most progressive that you have  seen in a long time.  And Bernie Sanders was very effective, I think in  making the case for college for all and all of that. </p><p>I think that's really important.  However, you know, it is her -- it is her  party, so she is going to put her mark on it and we know that she's going  to be -- she's going to listen to all sides. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, great to have you on the program -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Yes, great to be here -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching your speech, thank you so much -- </p><p>GRANHOLM:  Thanks, all right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Jennifer Granholm joining us.  Up next, two  iconic players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>More on the emotional reaction coming up.  Then hundreds of thousands of  Sci-Fi fans descend on San Diego for the big Comic-Con Conference. </p><p>And this year they have a treat in the works.  A brand new \"Wonder Woman\"  trailer, we will have a complete breakdown and give you the preview  straight ahead.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New details this morning as police are  investigating a fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub earlier this morning.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with that story and the headlines right now in our New York  headquarters, Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  That's right, Maria, and good morning.  Well,  officials say at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others  injured in the shooting outside of that Florida nightclub.</p><p>This happened just after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.  The Fort  Myers police telling Fox just moments ago that it's definitely not  terrorism, it appears to be gang-related.  </p><p>Though motive isn't clear.  They don't know if an argument led to the  shooting.  Three men are being questioned after they had fled the scene, no  idea what types of weapons were used.</p><p>Now, Maria, Fort Myers police say that the area is now considered safe,  this was posted on Facebook live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They're just running behind you and shooting, like,  you just see a whole bunch of kids running, just seeing somebody just  laying on the floor.</p><p>They're laying on the floor like -- got shot.  Fired ten times.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, victims were treated at two trauma centers for or still  hospitalized this morning.  The shooting comes more than a month after the  shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando which killed 49 people, that was the  deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.</p><p>The FBI is en route this morning to assist in this investigation.  Well, a  deadly heat wave continues to blink at parts of the United States.</p><p>Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona dying from the high heat  as near triple-digit temperatures, four states from New York, all the way  to California.</p><p>Now Cody Flom was in Arizona, he was hiking in the snow mountains when he  suffered a fatal heat stroke.  This is in the Phoenix area.  Overall,  temperatures could hit 100 degrees today in New York, Philadelphia and  Washington. </p><p>And the heat index could be much higher if you combine the temperature and  the humidity.  It's going to be a dangerous day weather-wise. </p><p>Well, this morning in sports, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza were indicted  into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>Piazza played 16 years with the Dodgers, Marlins, Mets, Padres and  Athletics and hit 427 home runs including a major league record 396 as a  catcher. </p><p>All this of course, happening yesterday.  Piazza played for 16 years, he is  best known of course as a Met.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PIAZZA, FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER:  It was actually the last team that I  had managed -- that I imagined wanted me.  But it was the most amazing  experience any human being could have. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Ken Griffey Jr. played 22 big league seasons with the Mariners,  Reds, and the White Sox.  He was a 13-time all-star and 10 times gold club  award winner as a centerfielder and hit 630 -- good Lord, 630 home runs,  amazing.</p><p>Griffey is best known of course as a Mariner.  And as Wonder Woman  celebrates her 75th birthday, Chris Pine, Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen  bringing a new \"Wonder Woman\" trailer to Comic-Con in San Diego. </p><p>Outfits and gadgets from the upcoming movie also introduced at the big  event.  Warner Brothers' \"Wonder Woman\" movie scheduled to release in June  of next year.  And that's the latest from New York, Maria, back to you in  Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you so much, Cheryl, up next, former astronaut  Mark Kelly gears up to speak at the Democratic National Convention this  week.</p><p>Before he does that though, he will give us his preview of his message to  the Democratic Party.  He'll join us live.  </p><p>And then later, Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation sending shockwaves  throughout the Democratic Party.  More on the disarray at the DNC coming  up, back in a moment. </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Our next guest endorsed Hillary Clinton back in  January, he is scheduled to speak on Wednesday night at the convention.</p><p>We want to bring in former astronaut and co-founder of Americans for  Responsible Solution, Mark Kelly.  He is the husband to former Democratic  Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. </p><p>Good to see you, thank you so much for joining us. </p><p>MARK KELLY, ASTRONAUT &amp; CO-FOUNDER, AMERICANS FOR RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION:   Thanks for having me on -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First question before anything is, how is your wife doing? </p><p>KELLY:  She's doing great, we got in late though, so she's still sleeping,  I think. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so, she's doing OK. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will be your message this week? What do you want to tell  the world? </p><p>KELLY:  You know, we don't get a lot of time, right? There's a lot of  speakers, so, a very short period of time.  </p><p>But you know, we're going to talk a little bit, you know, about -- at  least, I'm going to talk a little bit about my experience in the Navy and  in NASA and you know, what we should be doing as a country.  </p><p>And then as you might expect, I'll talk a little bit about gun violence and  you know, where we are and who we need to fix not only that problem, but  other serious problems that this country has.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Dagen, we've been talking about gun violence a lot, and  obviously this is front and center for the American people.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Hillary Clinton has actually laughed at Bernie Sanders in  terms of her proposals to crack down on guns in this country.</p><p>And do you back her position that there should be a waiver, that they  should get rid of the liability waiver for gun manufacturers.  I know that  was kind of as far left as she has ever gone in terms of gun control. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, that's a distinct difference between her -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right -- </p><p>KELLY:  And Senator Sanders.  And yes, I think so, I mean, why in this  country.  I mean, there's really just two things that get blanket immunity  and that's experimental pharmaceutical drugs from what I understand, right?</p><p>You assume a lot of risk, and then there's gun manufacturers that have a  blanket immunity and that's one of the reasons why, you know, we haven't  increased the safety of firearms. </p><p>You know why -- you know, when you look at products like cars for instance.   The death rate from car accidents goes down, and the death rate from guns  does not.</p><p>And you know, one of the things you can point to is plaque which is out of  immunity.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Mark, your wife was able to relate to people in an intensely  emotional way.</p><p>And her story really grabbed people.  I found it in this election, Hillary  Clinton has really had trouble emotionally connecting with the voters. </p><p>People are really resonating with this story, considering what you and your  wife have gone through, can you give advice to Hillary Clinton on her  campaign of how she can emotionally connect to the voters in the way that  Trump is? </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know, I'm a military veteran and an astronaut.  I might  not be the most emotional person myself in trying to connect with people.</p><p>And I'm not one to give, you know, that kind of advice.  But you're right,  you know, Gabby is really good at that.  She always has been and people do  connect with her emotionally. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you think Hillary can do that given the fact that  there all these questions about her honesty and about, you know,  likability? </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know, I have campaigned with Hillary, Gabby has, too, you  know, one-on-one and with, you know, people in the audience, I think she  connects with them very well. </p><p>This tough -- you know, this is a -- this is a tough business.  But the  contrast between Hillary and I think Donald Trump is pretty clear.  I mean,  Hillary being somebody who is experienced and a problem solver.</p><p>And somebody who really has been campaigning on rhetoric that does not  paint our country in the best possible way. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you know, I know that President Obama came out,  and said, look, everything that Donald Trump said last week doesn't jive  with reality. </p><p>But I mean, it's not exactly rainbows and puppy dogs out there.  I mean,  we've got another attack this morning.  We continue to see, you know, ISIS  fighters get stronger. </p><p>What's your solution to all of this? -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, you know, I served in combat over Iraq, you know, during  desert storm.  You know, I have experience -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>KELLY:  In that part of the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for your service to our great country -- </p><p>KELLY:  You're welcome.  I mean, we do have -- we do have problems.  And  problems require thoughtful solutions.</p><p>You know, they require -- I think they -- you know, to some extent require  somebody who has experience doing this.  And I think, you know, the choice  is clear here in November. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Matter of fact, just say to you, sir, I supported Jeb Bush in the  primary, and for the better part of the year, we try to make this argument  that experience mattered.</p><p>And it didn't work for us in the campaign.  So, I think Hillary Clinton is  going to be successful again, so, she's going to have emotionally connect,  and try something other than the experience argument. </p><p>Sixteen Republicans running, trying to say that about him and it didn't  work. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>KELLY:  You see that, I would not dispute that, but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and the danger is that the Democrats dismiss Donald Trump  and just dismiss him as she -- from the hip blowhard. </p><p>Because after last week, according to the new \"Cnn\" poll, he's got a six- percentage point bump in the polls -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is the biggest bump since the year 2000. </p><p>KELLY:  But as you would expect after the convention, and you know, you  also can't argue with the fact that he has been successful and he's been  successful for a reason.</p><p>And that should not be dismissed.  It should be taken very seriously. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think you're going to get -- you think that the  Democratic Party gets a bump after this convention? </p><p>KELLY:  I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>KELLY:  You know, history would say that, and you know, we'll see how  things look here in September and October.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you, thanks so much -- </p><p>KELLY:  Thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For joining us -- </p><p>KELLY:  Appreciate it -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Mark Kelly there.  Still to come, first  leaked e-mail showing a rigged system against Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Now, the DNC chair steps down.  More on the chaos at the DNC coming up.   And then Verizon finalizes its deal to acquire Yahoo for nearly $5 billion.</p><p>What that means for the beleaguered internet giant coming up, back in a  moment.  Stay with us, thank you -- </p><p>KELLY:  Thank you -- </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Once again, here's Maria Bartiromo. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, coming to you live this week from the Democratic National  Convention here in Philadelphia.  It is Monday, July 25th.  Your top  stories right now, 8:30 AM on the East Coast, Democrats in disarray, DNC  chairwoman Debby Wasserman Schultz loses her job after leaked e-mails show  that the committee worked behind the scenes against Bernie Sanders.   Wasserman Schultz counterpart, Reince Priebus, on the RNC side, weighs in  on the controversy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, RNC CHAIRMAN:  Today's event shows, I think, really, what  an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week and unifying their  party, and starting out the week by losing your party chairman over  longstanding bitterness between factions.  There's no way to keep something  together. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, the deal of the day, Verizon is acquiring Yahoo, in  a deal valued at $4.8 billion dollars.  The Yahoo Shares are down in the  premarket.  What it means for Marissa Mayer's future coming up.  When in  Rome, you eat pasta and pizza.  When in Philly, it's all about cheese  steaks.  We've got the two top restaurants, Gino's and Pat's, right here on  set, coming up, talking about their historic rivalry and what having with  the convention in Philly, means for business.  </p><p>Turn to the broader market this morning.  Futures are searching for some  direction this morning.  As you can see, it is a mixed showing with the Dow  Industrials expected to open up about 8 points.  We've got a lot of  economic data and earnings news to really drive the story this week.  In  Europe, stocks may see a little change.  Take a look at what's happening in  Europe this morning.  As you see, fractional gains from the FT 100, but the  DAX Index in Germany up about 1 percent.  And there was a mixed picture  overnight in Asia, where the Shanghai Composite was up a fraction as well  as the Korean Kospi, but the others lower on the day.  A top DNC staffer,  Brad Marshal, going after Bernie Sanders fate in one of the thousands  leaked e-mails sparking outrage.  Here it is, it might make no difference,  but for Kentucky -- and we can get someone to ask his belief.  Does he  believe in God?  He has skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage.  I read  he's an atheist, this could make several points difference with my peeps in  West Virginia and Kentucky.  My southern Baptist peeps would draw a big  difference between a Jew and an atheist, Amy Dacey, CEO of the DNC,  subsequently responded, amen, according to these emails.  Joining us right  now is the creator and producer of the documentary, Hillary's America,  Dinesh D'Souza.  Good to see you, Dinesh, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DINESH D'SOUZA, PRODUCER:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your reaction to this e-mail scandal? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Wow.  I mean, this is the way the Clintons have operated for a  long time.  They always put their thumb on the scale.  And so, ironically,  but this party is called the Democratic Party, you think that they'd be  democratic I.E.  Have fair rules of elections to give their people a fair  shake, see who emerges on the top, that's not the case.  It looks like  Hillary was sort of the crowned candidate from the beginning, and they were  trying to sort of weigh this horse race to make sure that Bernie just ran a  show candidacy if you will. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even on Saturday Night Live, they made a joke out of it,  basically saying, look, this thing is so rigged, and, you know -- how  about, you know, when you won all of the people, but I still got all the  super delegates.  So, there was speculation about this for a long time. </p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think the irony is on the Republican side, you have this  crowded race, 17 guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>D'SOUZA: . a bitter cage fight.  I mean a lot of mutual acrimony and  accusations.  And yet, ironically, at the end of the day the Republicans  might come together more strongly because when you have a fair process, you  can respect the winner.  When the process is rigged, then you feel like you  haven't lost, you've been cheated.  And these are all themes in our movie,  our movie is, I think, intended to be a catalyst to unify the Republicans  by pointing to the Clintons and saying, look, the Clintons don't really  play by the rules, they never have, and that's partly what this election is  about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  Congratulations, because we want to show a clip right  here.  The film is now in the top ten over the weekend, so congrats to you.   Here is a portion of the documentary that Dinesh has written and produced,  Hillary's America, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  All crime is about stealing.  The big criminals are  still at large. </p><p>CLINTON:  Didn't see any reason to keep them. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  The system doesn't go after them, because they run the  system.  It's time to go behind the curtain and discover the soul of the  Democratic Party. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you trying to achieve with this film, Dinesh? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well, partly what we're trying to do is we're trying to show that  the Democratic Party puts on a front.  We're the party for the little guy.   We're a party for minorities.  We're the party that always fought for  women's rights.  Now, historically, the opposite is true.  The Democratic  Party, historically, has been the party of slavery, of segregation.  The  Democrats fought women's suffrage for 30 years before the Republicans  pushed it through.  The Democrats who avoids the party of the clan of  lynching, of forced sterilization, so they've got an unbelievably sordid  history, and many of the Clinton scandals are just on the tip of the  iceberg. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  There was never one Republican Jim  Crowe Governor, people don't realize that.  We were the party of freedom  and emancipation.  But, Dinesh D'Souza, what is the guiding principle of  the Clintons, and who corrupted who in your opinion?  Because we know  they're both political co-conspirators in pursuit of their own ambition.   But was it Hillary who kind of got Bill to this point, or was it Bill who  got Hillary to this point? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think the guiding principle of the Clintons is me, me, me.  The  difference with Obama, Obama is an ideologue, and whether we agree with him  or now he had ideological goals.</p><p>SAYEGH:  Correct.</p><p>D'SOUZA:  The Clintons are sort of partners in crime.  They're a tag team.   Ironically, I think the driving force is always been Hillary.  And the  reason is that Hillary needs Bill more than Bill needs Hillary.  Bill would  have been a success on his own.  Hillary always knew that she needed kind  of a pitchman to be her sales guide.  And so, she needs to figure out a way  create a marriage with Bill that would cement him to her, and being his  enabler is the way to do that. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  But even after all these years, he - - Bill Clinton is an incredible resale politician, who has a connection  even with people on an individual basis.  After all these years, Hillary  Clinton is still never been able to learn that from him. </p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think that's right.  Hillary is the strategist.  In some ways,  I think, she's more ambitious, because with Bill, and you saw this when he  was president, if you put Bill Clinton in a big room and everyone tells him  he's the greatest, if his immediate needs are satisfied he's happy.  With  Hillary, I think there's a more of almost a radical impulse, if she's not  running things, telling everybody what to do, snuffing out her opponents,  she's got a much more ambitious view of what politics is all about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But your description of her will be called sexist by her  supporters.  That's where they always go.  </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The dog whistle, when she was talking about the Hillary  standard.  That's she's known to be different standards.  That was a dog  whistle to women, that if sexism has nothing to do with her behavior, it's  just the fact that she's a woman. </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well, I think that's saying the opposite.  I'm saying that she's  in the tradition of very powerful men who have always wanted to lord it  over.  I mean, if you think about the tyrannical impulse that drove a  Bonaparte, a Caesar, a Genghis Khan, is that desire to dominate.  Bill  doesn't have it, Hillary does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:   Do you think what's being said at this convention this week is  going to resonate with people, or do you think what you're saying -- how do  you think it's going to play out for the voter? </p><p>D'SOUZA:  Well, this is why I'm trying really hard to get independents and  minorities to come see our movie.  Because -- we had black actors in our  movie, when they saw the film they were blown away.  They said we had no  idea this was our actual history.  So the Democrats will put out the  official story, they always do, we have a counter narrative running in  1,500 theaters across the country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Dinesh, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>D'SOUZA:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate, we'll be watching, Dinesh D'Souza there.    Coming up, the resignation of Debby Wasserman Schultz, just one of the  controversies clouding the convention kick off.  Stuart Varney says the  scandals are changing the party for good.  He'll join us next.  And then  reports say Tesla and Solar City are inching closer to coming together,  coming up.  More on how that merger may go forward.  Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Philadelphia this morning.  We're 45  minutes away from the opening bell.  The market is expected to open  fractionally higher, really searching for direction.  Here's a look at some  stocks on the move this morning.  Yahoo shares under pressure after the  company's core assets are being sold to Verizon, Verizon acquiring Yahoo  for $4.8 billion.  One question still up in the air, Yahoo CEO, Marissa  Mayer's future.  She said she will stay at the company, but Verizon  executives are not saying that quite yet.  Solar City shares up 3 percent  this morning, the company reportedly close to a merger with Tesla.  Reuters  has reporting that the two companies are in final stages of carrying out  due diligence.  When the initial reported the deal came out last month,  questions were raised because Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and he's also  the chairman of Solar City.  Musk has refused himself he said from voting  on this deal.  </p><p>Today's Democratic Convention kicks off with an e-mail scandal, a  resignation, and angry protesters as the party's nomination ceremony is  rocked by controversy.  Stuart Varney said that this is not your father's  Democratic Party anymore.  Stuart joins us right now with more.  Stuart,  Good morning to you. </p><p>STUART VARNEY, VARNEY &amp; CO. HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  Let me qualify  that, if I may. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is not your father's Democratic Party in terms of policy.  I  mean, it's really swung way out to the left.  But it's your grandfather's  party when it comes to the leadership thereof.  I mean, it's still -- speak  of Pelosi.  It's still senator from Nevada, Harry Reid.  It's still Hillary  Clinton.  These are names and figures from the past that solidified their  position and they still lead the party.  This is the party of the elites.   They seemed to have missed the message that the anti-elite feeling in this  country is very, very strong, capitalized by Donald trump, who leads the  Republican Party in a relatively unified fashion.  Now, you have a bitterly  divided Democrat Party led by the elites still with the insurgent Bernie  Sanders being conspired against.  I want to know, Maria, what's he going to  say tonight?   He speaks tonight.   If he turns around and says, OK, we'll  play kumbaya, let's unify.  He's betrayed himself and he betrayed his  supporters.   If he goes out there and says I'm really angry about this,  he's totally undermining Hillary Clinton and dividing the Democrat Party.   This is fascinating stuff, isn't it? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  And you know what?  Jennifer Granholm was just  on, and I asked her that question, has she seen a big change in the  Democratic Party, is it much more liberal than ever before?  She said this  is the most progressive agenda.</p><p>VARNEY:  What?</p><p>BARTIROMO: . the party has ever seen.  That's what she just said. </p><p>VARNEY:  It's a socialist party.  Look, I maybe -- you've got to criticize  me for being extreme, but it's a socialist policy.  That's the policy that  they've adopted by this old style people, who's been in the news for 20 or  30 years, ignoring the people, the up and comers, the millennials, the  Bernie Sanders of this world who really want change in the party structure.   What a dichotomy it really is. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Stuart, isn't it -- it's Tony Sayegh, isn't it ironic that at one  point during this primary season, Hillary Clinton said she was going to  appoint Bill Clinton to basically manage the economy.  Bill Clinton  regulated Wall Street, he cuts capital gain taxes.  He was very pro-growth  reform entitlements, free trade agreements, obviously, Donald Trump points  his support of NAFTA, and China joining the WTO, isn't that all  contradiction to.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>SAYEGH: . the modern Democratic Progressive Party? </p><p>VARNEY:  Absolutely.  Yes, it is, Tony.  Well said.  Couldn't have put it  better myself.  Do you want to come on my show a little later, because that  was good stuff.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's going to raise the minimum wage, she's going to raise  taxes. </p><p>VARNEY:  Yep.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's against the TPP.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She wants to expand social security.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yep.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Expand Medicare which is going broke in 12 years.  She wants --  again, she wants to really a public option in Medicare as well. </p><p>VARNEY:  I'm just dying to see what Bernie Sanders says tonight.  I mean. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, me, too. </p><p>VARNEY: . whichever way he goes, this party is in real trouble.  Oh, what a  difference a weekend does make.  Remember last week, it was all the  Republicans, oh, chaos this and plagiarism that.  What nonsense.  Look  what's going on this week, for heaven sake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  We'll see if Bernie Sanders addresses the Debbie  Wasserman Schultz resignation tonight.  We'll be watching.  And, Stuart, of  course, we're going to see you in ten minutes.  We'll be watching Varney &amp;  Co.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Varney &amp; Co., begins every day, 9 AM  Eastern, right after Mornings With Maria.  Up next, one food famously  associated with the city of brotherly love, the Philly cheese steak, we  haven't forgotten them.  Straight ahead, we're talking to two of the iconic  name in the business and their 50-year-old rivalry, that's raking in the  big money.  Keep it right here, Mornings With Maria, comes right back with  Philly cheese steaks.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  There is one food famously associated with the  city of brotherly love.  It is the Philly cheese steak.  And it is been  around since 1930.  I want to bring in two of the iconic names in the  cheese steak business, Frank Olivieri, owner of Pat's King of Steaks, and  Geno Vento, president of Geno's steaks.  Good to see you guys, thank you so  much for joining us. </p><p>GENO VENTO, GENO'S STEAKS OWNER:  Well, thank you for having us.</p><p>FRANK OLIVIERI, PAT'S KINGS OF STEAK OWNER:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that you guys are massive rivals.   You're right across the street from each other, and yet, you're friends. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Year, we're rivals, we're friends.  We live in the same  building, actually. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, how big is this business, the cheese steaks? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  It's booming. </p><p>VENTO:  It's insane.  </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.</p><p>VENTO:  Cheese steaks it's a Philadelphia comfort food, everybody wants it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  And so, that's right.  It's iconic.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . right?  And so do you expect a big boost for business with the  DNC in town this week? </p><p>VENTO:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, just the amount of people just coming in  and being a tourist destination, I mean, it's the thing to do when you come  to Philly, get a cheese steak.  So, you have two right here. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  I usually say people comes to Philadelphia they get a cheese  steak from one of our place.  Look at the liberty bell in front of Rocky  statue. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, that's what they do.  Why is cheese steak so, you  know, so iconic, and so great about Philly, why? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  It's just one of those things, my great Uncle Pat and my  grandfather invented the sandwich back in 1930, and it's just an iconic  sandwich.  And, you know, Geno's father right across the street. </p><p>VENTO:  It's '66. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  It's '66, and we've been fierce rivals ever since, but we're  best friends. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  And so, when you -- what's the sales pitch to go  to Geno's or go to Pat's, which one should I do?  You know, can you believe  I've never had a cheese steak from Philly?</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Really?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  I've been hearing all about it for years. </p><p>VENTO:  Well, you've got like 10 of them right in front of you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got all these cheese steaks.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  How did they let you into the city without having one before? </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- when I'm here.  So, what's the secret sauce to the  Philly cheese steak? </p><p>VENTO:  Well, the official cheese stake of Philadelphia would be the cheese  whiz, and then you get onions or no onions.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Exactly.</p><p>VENTO:  So, do you like onions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I guess so.</p><p>VENTO:  All right.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  I think the secret to it is that I think, you know, we both take  pride in our product.  I mean, if I won't eat it, I won't sell it, and I  know Geno feels the same way. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You guys are both running small businesses that have become,  you know, bigger businesses, obviously.  Tell me how business is right now? </p><p>VENTO:  It's unbelievable.  I mean, we're doing record numbers and, you  know, being the tourism and being the summertime, and what Philly has to  offer, I mean, I can't speak for Frankie, but, you know, it's doing very  well. </p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that Frankie? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  We're doing very well.  As a matter of fact, Elizabeth Warren  was down yesterday -- now we say the winning president always comes out,  you know, our stores. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I know, exactly.  So, it's a must-stop for celebrities  and for politicians, why is that, because they want to have an iconic  sandwich? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  I think they want to win that, you know, small vote, when it get  in the nitty-gritty of Philadelphia, and then cheese steaks are in the  nitty-gritty of Philadelphia. </p><p>VENTO:  And they want to be in the heart of South Philly, that's where all  the action happens. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you've seen a change in business just over the last day or  so, I mean, tell me what you've seen so far from the DNC and its impact? </p><p>VENTO:  I mean, just the lines forming, you know, people coming in,  taking  pictures, getting, you know, half of it being able to see all of them come  in, and so all the secret service, you know, the delegates, and, you know,  I mean, they have to eat, too, you know. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, have you made a different plans or arrangements to  accommodate all these new people coming in. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  We ordered extra bread, and I'm sure he did, too. </p><p>VENTO:  Yeah, we do.  That's right. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  What we did was -- we're kind of running a crazy promotion where  we're making a Hillary Clinton sandwich and a Bernie Sanders sandwich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  And we're going to see at the end of the week who's ordered more  sandwiches, kind of like a fun little thing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  What's the difference between a Bernie sandwich  and a Hillary? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Well, the Hillary sandwich we call it a heart attack, it has the  three cheese.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, the heart attack. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  And the Bernie Sanders sandwich which we call it the gaboom,  which is it has the mushrooms, peppers, onions, cheese wiz, and. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You put it all on. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Put it all on, yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Do you do anything like that? </p><p>VENTO:  No, we're still in the regular cheese steak.  I'm afraid to do  that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because that's been resonating already.  </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So how much is the cheese steaks? </p><p>VENTO:  $10. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Same price.  We price that over dinner together.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, then there's got to be lots of companies that are sort  of like want to do business with you, right?  Everybody wants to have the  Geno's or the Frankie's cheese steak? </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Yeah.  Actually, there's one more guy who lives in our building,  Tony Luke, and he's the other one, we're like the three amigos. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They all live in the same building.  </p><p>OLIVIERI:  We all live in the same building.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that by design? </p><p>VENTO:  Well, I was first, tony was second, and then me and Tony talked to  Frankie into moving in. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else can I buy at the cheese steak shop?  Not cheese  steak. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Cheese steak you can get -- well we started with hot dogs.  So  you can get a hot dog at my place, and we have pork.  Do you serve roast  pork? </p><p>VENTO:  Yeah we have roast pork.  We have Italians hoagies, and I'm  bringing meatball pork back. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  All right.  Well, I've going to have to take a bite  of one of these, Frank Olivieri, Geno Vento, really good to see you, both. </p><p>OLIVIERI:  Oh, thank you, Maria, thanks for having us.</p><p>VENTO:   Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations and good luck on the big week. </p><p>VENTO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>OLIVIERI:  Thank you, </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from our all-star panel live from the  Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Before we go, let's get some final thoughts from  our all-star panel.  We are kicking off the Democratic National Convention.   Morgan, what are you thinking about? </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Everyone is talking about  Bernie Sanders, what he's going to say tonight.  I'm actually most looking  forward to hearing what Elizabeth Warren has to say, because I think she's  great at firing up the base, and I don't think she's going to be happy over  this DNC controversy.  So, I'm looking for Elizabeth Warren -- I think  she'll be the litmus test for the rest of the liberals. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  How can you be happy when you've got all these  protesters outside?  I actually hit the streets yesterday, I saw these  protests heating up.  I took a couple of pictures.  Then they started  hosing one another.  But all the streets were closed down.  You couldn't  get anywhere because the protesters were just dominating. </p><p>SAYEGH:  This was a rocky start and it's turning into a political  avalanche.  Do not under estimate the weight of the party chair, the head  of this convention, resigning a day before these proceedings begin.  I  think the Bernie Sanders delegates are going to react differently than  Bernie Sanders himself.  And throw in there this, Maria, I also believe  they're not happy with this election, the Sanders folks of V.P. Kaine.  And  that's going to get them agitated as well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Probably true, yeah. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Pay attention to the whole speakers list, because today it is  union leaders, and it is Dan Malloy, the governor of my state of  Connecticut who can teach you how to drive business out of your state by  raising taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who can teach you how to destroy jobs.  And they want to know  why the economy is in the state that it is, look at the speaker list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thanks everybody, great show.  We'll see you  tomorrow, same time, same place, but first, Varney &amp; Co., begins right now,  over to Stuart, Stu.    </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

I am Maria  Bartiromo.  Welcome back.  It is Monday, July 25.  Your top stories right  now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Drama at the Democratic national convention and it hasn't even started yet.   It kicks off today.</p><p>Party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announcing her resignation, after  an e-mail leak shows that DNC favored Clinton over Bernie Sanders the  entire primary season.  Clinton campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon weighed  in on the shake-up last night on Fox News.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN FALLON, CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON:  Debbie Wasserman Schultz is  committed to defeating Donald Trump.  So she's going to stay involved in  terms of helping us lead a 50-state campaign.  But I think given all the  distractions that have arisen in the last of couple days especially in  light of these e-mails this was a very good step that will help unite the  party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is raising new questions about party unity certainly.   Sanders is set to address the convention tonight and his supporters have  already begun filling the streets.  They were protesting all day yesterday.</p><p>Breaking news this morning -- another shooting, this time at a nightclub in  Florida, at least two people killed, 17 others injured.  Authorities are  searching for suspects.  We have the details, coming up.</p><p>And the deal of the day: Verizon acquiring Yahoo -- the announcement  crossing the tape right now.  The deal is valued at $4.8 billion.  What it  means for the future of the struggling web company coming up.  The stocks  are halted in the premarket right now.</p><p>A big weekend at the box office to tell you about.  \"Star Trek fans went to  the theatres in droves.  Details on film's ticket sales coming up and how  well it did.</p><p>Markets this morning is showing a flat performance, edging higher.  The Dow  Industrials going back and forth between negative and positive territory  this morning, as you can see there.  Later in the week investors have a lot  to digest including economic data, a two-day Federal Reserve meeting, a  meeting in the Bank of Japan and a whole host of second quarter earnings  particularly in the tech sector.</p><p>In Europe today stocks are higher.  Take a look -- fractional moves there  as well but they are higher across the board.  The FT 100 just flipping  into positive territory eking out a gain right now of about 1 point, the  DAX index has approved over the last hour, up about 1 percent right now and  the CAC 40 in Paris up three-quarters of one percent. </p><p>It was a mixed performance in Asia overnight.  As you can see there,  fractional move as you see.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning right here.</p><p>And joining me this morning to talk about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Maverick PAC national co-chair Morgan Ortagus, and Republican  strategist Tony Sayegh.  Good to see everybody.  </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning -- Maria. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  It's great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I thought Dennis Kucinich had some really interesting  comments earlier.  He is basically saying, look, Bernie Sanders should not  take this and withdraw your endorsement.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  It seems as if Bernie Sanders has begun to detach from his own  movement as early as he began to indicate endorsement to Hillary Clinton.   We're showing footage of protests here in Philadelphia.  By the way,  Sanders supporters have the most number of protester permits at the DNC.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SAYEGH:  So keep that in mind.  You have almost 2,000 Sanders delegates.  I  don't think Sanders himself is going to create any distance or maybe do  something beyond endorse Hillary Clinton tonight.  But I think his  supporters are very reluctant to do so.</p><p>You see already opposition to the Kaine pick.  They think he's way too  centrist, way too moderate, wrong on trade, goes with Wall Street.  This is  not going to be an easy convention for the Democrats.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We will see if he refers to it tonight.  He's going to be  among the kickoff speakers tonight, Bernie Sanders and First Lady Michelle  Obama.  We're going to talk about all this coming up.</p><p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is with us this hour; New York  Congresswoman Caroline Maloney is with us this morning, Former astronaut  and Gabrielle Giffords' husband Mark Kelly will join us, and former  Michigan governor, a senior advisory to a super PAC backing Hillary Clinton  Jennifer Granholm is with us as well.</p><p>Meanwhile a major shake-up rocking the Democratic Party amid a new e-mail  scandal just hours before the Democratic national convention kicks off here  in Philadelphia.</p><p>I want to get right to Blake Berman.  He's inside the Wells Fargo Arena  here in Philly.  Blake -- good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BERMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there -- Maria.  Good morning to you  as well.</p><p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz later today will gavel in the Democratic national  convention.  She'll give a speech later this week.  And she will gavel it  out the convention on Thursday and that will be it for her as it relates to  her duties as the chairwoman of the DNC.</p><p>Wasserman Schultz yesterday here in Philadelphia, announcing that she will  resign at the end of this convention due to the WikiLeaks scandal.  Of  course, over the weekend WikiLeaks released some 19,000 internal DNC memos  which showed that during the primary process, several top DNC staffers  actively favored Bernie Sanders -- actively favored rather Hillary Clinton  over Bernie Sanders -- in fact trying to tip the scales Clinton's way over  Sanders.  Wasserman Schultz herself had some choice words in some e-mails  as it related to Sanders' campaign manager.</p><p>Last evening Brian Fallon who is one of the top spokespeople for Hillary  Clinton said that they would not defend those e-mails but they also believe  that the e-mails prove or ate least show that nothing would have changed as  a result to the end result of the primary process.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FALLON:  Let's not confuse these e-mails which I am not going to defend  with the idea of a rigged nomination process.  The election was really won  on the ground. It was the voters in the Democratic primary that decided  Hillary Clinton should be our nominee.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Donald Trump as you might imagine was jumping all over this  yesterday.  He sent out a series of tweets; one which reads and I am  quoting here.  He writes \"The Democrats are in a total meltdown.  But the  biased media will say how great they are doing.  E-mails say the rigged  system is alive and well.\"</p><p>Of course, Maria -- the entire time Trump has been trying to make the  argument that the primary process on both sides is rigged.  He continued to  make that case yesterday, very strategic though on his part as he will try  to bring some of those Sanders supporters over to his side.  Sanders, by  the way, speaks inside here later this evening.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake -- thank you so much.  Blake Berman.</p><p>We want to bring in former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  Governor --  good to see you.  What is your take on all of this?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The scandal the DNC e-mail dumps and now Debbie Wasserman  Schultz forced to step down?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well I am pretty sure the DNC wishes that they had put all of  their e-mails on Hillary's server where things just disappear but,  unfortunately, it all got leaked.  And, you know, the trouble is that the  first day of their convention is all about the controversy of the e-mails.</p><p>And Bernie Sanders supporters are out there in the streets.  Bernie looks  like he's kind of waved the white flag of surrender.  But as I said last  night on Fox, Hillary comes into this convention with more baggage than  Delta Airlines.  It's a going to be a rocky week.</p><p>And for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she's going to be virtually invisible.   You will be seeing her face on milk cartons during the week in Philadelphia  -- I am pretty sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Well look, we should point out that Hillary just hired  Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  So that is only going to fuel the fire, that --  they are in the tank.  I mean -- </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, look -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, I mean -- why would she do that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was best for her.  She got fired so Hillary gave her a job.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  I would love to ask the governor this question and definitely get  your perspective on this.  And we talked about this with Dennis Kucinich  earlier.  He was outraged as well.</p><p>There were indications that they were planning to use Bernie Sanders'  religious views against him.  They were going to put out these open  questions about whether or not he was an atheist.  They were going to try  to wedge that as an issue in a state like West Virginia.</p><p>Governor, I mean you're a man of faith.  You were obviously presidential  candidate, former candidate.  I mean how does that sound to you?  And, of  course, then to Maria's point, Hillary says ok, well, you are going to  leave the DNC but now you're on the HRC campaign.  I mean does that make  sense at all?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No it doesn't at all.  And I think it really creates a problem  for Hillary to say ok, so we expose that Debbie Wasserman Schultz really  didn't play her role as objectively and fairly as she was supposed to do.   She was in the tank for Hillary.  She violated really all of the ethical  standards that a party chairman should uphold.  So we are going to hire  her.</p><p>I mean if you've got a candidate who has a 68 percent lack of  trustworthiness view by the American people then who do you hire?  Somebody  who has a worse reputation than you do.  I mean only Hillary would hire  somebody to deal with her credibility problem who has less credibility than  Hillary.</p><p>I do agree with you that this religion issue -- that's huge because it  really shows that there was no depths that they were willing to -- that  they were unwilling to mine.  You know, Bernie supporters are against  fracking but I am going to tell you something it became very apparent in  these e-mail leaks that the deepest drilling was going on at the DNC trying  to go into such things Bernie Sanders' faith which frankly has nothing to  do with whether he's capable of being president.  And I think everybody  should be and is offended by that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to create a whole narrative about well, let's get  somebody to ask him if he even believes in God.  You know my peeps in West  Virginia -- that will really resonate with them.</p><p>Listen to what Hillary Clinton said about this because she was asked about  it in this interview that they gave to \"60 Minutes\".  Listen to this --  Governor.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I didn't know anything about  it.  And I haven't read any of those but I am adamantly opposed to anyone  bringing religion into our political process.  I mean the constitution says  no religious tests so that is just absolutely wrong and unacceptable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on that -- attacking a candidate on their  religion and how she answered it -- Governor?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It is kind of like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and you have  Sergeant Schultz.  Hillary Clinton -- I know nothing, I know nothing.  And  that has been her answer on a lot of things. </p><p>Perhaps she didn't know.  I am going to have to assume Hillary Clinton  didn't know what was being talked about in the inner sort of -- may be  walls of the DNC.  I get that.</p><p>But it is offensive.  I am glad that she repudiated it.  But frankly, you  know, if Bernie Sanders is an atheist so be it.  Honestly, I would rather  have an honest atheist as president than I had a phony believer.  So I say  that as a person who is a person of faith and as a Christian just want  authenticity.  I want somebody to be who they are.</p><p>And you know, let us make the decision.  There is no religious test to poll  public office in America.  But I have got more respect for people who are  honest about where they stand than I do with people who pretend that they  believe something when in fact they don't.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is hard to say that nobody knew anything because this  whole narrative has been out for a long time.  A lot of people have been  criticizing the fact that the debates, for example, were on nights when no  one was watching TV.</p><p>Real quick, Governor -- before you go let's talk policy for a second.  What  are we going to hear this week from the Dems that might be different from  what we heard last week when it comes to policy and what Hillary Clinton  would do as president?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think everything.</p><p>You know you are going to -- really see a dramatic contrast on law and  order, on trade, on the economy, on dealing with terrorism, even on  admitting where terrorism really rests.  It is going to be as complete a  contrast as possible.</p><p>And I think Hillary's problem is how does she placate the far left which is  really in control more and more of her party and get them to be  enthusiastic about her candidacy and her potential administration.  She's  got a challenge on her hands with that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>All right Governor -- great to see you as always.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You bet.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee there.  </p><p>We will also hear about minimum wage -- right.  They're going to raise  minimum wage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Watch this today though.  All the speakers, many of them,  are from unions.  They're union leaders.  You've Randi Weingarten -- a  lineup of them because the only good jobs in America are union jobs.  That  is what they are going to start arguing.  And why did those jobs go  overseas in the first place?  Because the unions were on verge of putting  the companies out of business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do what the union want -- raise taxes and raise wages.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And fill their coffers so then they can promote Democratic  candidates because that's what union workers really do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  There you go.</p><p>Coming up we are following the breaking news of a nightclub shooting in  Fort Myers, Florida leaving at least two people dead, 17 others injured</p><p>Then the drawn-out bidding process is over.  Yahoo finally has a buyer,  Verizon -- $4.8-billion buyout of the former web pioneer, Yahoo.  Coming  up.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Police are investigating a failed shooting at a Florida nightclub early  this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the story and the headlines at  headquarters now.  Cheryl -- good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  We are trying to get some  new details for you this morning on the shooting.  Officials say at least  two people were killed, and as many as 17 others were injured in this  shooting outside of a Florida nightclub, this happened, just after midnight  in Fort Myers at Club Blue.  Gunshots rang out in the parking lot and at  this hour there are two active crime scenes that we know of.</p><p>Here's what one mother said.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I just thank God that my daughter is ok.  Because she  could have been shot, her dodging bullets and running, dropping between  cars as she did.  What kids have to go through they can't enjoy themselves. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Casone:  This is an all age event, by the way, Maria that was happening in  Fort Myers.  Authorities say injuries range from minor to life-threatening  right now.  Three people have been taken in to custody and the  investigation is continuing.  The shooting comes more than a month after  the shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando which killed 49 people.  That  was the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.  </p><p>Well, switching gears this morning there was no winner for Saturday's  Powerball jackpot worth $391 million so the prize is growing -- it's now at  $422 million for Wednesday's drawing.  That is the ninth largest in  Powerball history.  By the way, if you're feeling kind of confident this  morning, the odds of a $2 ticket hitting the jackpot are more than 292  million to one.  The jackpot has only been hit three times, this year.   Last year the Powerball numbers were picked 12 times -- so good luck.  </p><p>And finally this -- Maria.  Very interesting study today -- a new study by  a research firm MSCI finds the best paid CEOs tend to run some of the worst  performing companies.  The analysis shows that $100 invested in the 20  percent companies with the highest paid CEOs would have grown to $265  dollars over 10 years.  But the same amount investment in the companies  with the lowest paid CEOs would have grown to $367.  You can do the math on  this one -- guys.  The study about examined 800 CEOs during the decade  ending back in 2014 -- Maria.  So Marissa Mayer might be thinking about  that one this morning.   </p><p>Back to you in Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- Cheryl.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Are you surprised by that study -- Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not really.  Not very surprised, the Marisa Mayer thing though,  I want to point out what I pointed out last hour -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- $50 million if she is let go as part of this deal when she's  already earned $100 million in cash compensation and stocks.  </p><p>I don't know -- again, you get paid for driving a company's value into the  ground.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, you know, it's crazy especially since we argue so much from  the political side about meritocracy and the free market, you know, being  able to do it the best.  How could a CEO who performs so badly still get so  much money?  That doesn't seem to me to be a best practice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wonder if that becomes a talking point though during the DNC - - </p><p>SAYEGH:  Not to give them any ideas.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because the politicians would love to tell private companies  how much to pay their CEOs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But when it comes to technology.  Did you see yesterday?   I saw on Twitter, that Facebook said they made a mistake but they had  blocked all the WikiLeaks dump.  And they came and they unblocked -- oh,  can we unblock?  It was mistake.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was a lot of blocking of that information on Twitter  specifically.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twitter, Facebook -- so I mean you talk about DNC and  technology -- they're together.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, we should remember that next time -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Suppression of a free press is suppression of free speech.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really gets me angry because it is all about free speech.   They said it was a mistake.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, so the next time they say that they can't block ISIS when  it comes on Twitter or Facebook we can just remind them that they were able  to do it with WikiLeaks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They really don't aggressively -- particularly Twitter, they do  not aggressively police those ISIS accounts and it is almost unthinkable  and so repugnant.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But to block information -- I mean WikiLeaks was the  biggest story all day yesterday.  People wanted to see these e-mails and  they decide to just block it.  </p><p>SAYEGH:  And I bet it wasn't trending on Google since we know they  manipulate searches to benefit Hillary Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You brought up technology and  technology with the DNC -- actually there I think they're on the same side.   Now Peter Thiel though, we saw him the other night at the RNC.</p><p>SAYEGH:  Amazing speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did a great job.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Highlight of the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It really was.  All right.  Let's take a break.</p><p>We want to check markets as we go to a break right here because futures  certainly have improved in the last half an hour.  Take a look.</p><p>Nasdaq's been in the red pretty much for the last hour but we're looking at  (inaudible) interest in the larger names in the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  Futures indicating a hire opening for those averages  open.</p><p>Investors are eyeing a slew of big technology earnings this week ahead of  the open -- Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet -- all  reporting quarterly results.</p><p>Coming up, it is official.  Verizon finalizes its deal to acquire Yahoo for  nearly $5 billion -- what that means for the beleaguered Internet giant.   Coming up.</p><p>Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>This just in moments ago -- Verizon making an acquisition of Yahoo official  for $4.8 billion, the deal giving VerizonYahoo's one billion monthly  active users and its digital content building on the online businesses  Verizon acquired through its $4.4-billion acquisition of AOL last year.</p><p>Joining us right now from New York, Recon Capital CIO Kevin Kelly.  We're  looking at Yahoo shares looking fractionally lower and, of course, Verizon  also active.</p><p>Kevin -- what is your take on the deal?  Is this going to work?  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL:  This deal is going to work especially for  Verizon.  One of the reasons why is because they can actually monetize the  assets and plug it into a mobile world that we have right now.  We have  seen that has been the problem with Yahoo.  They were always six months too  late.</p><p>They never really transitioned to the mobile so that is why you couldn't  see them increase their advertising revenue.  I mean they were getting  single digit growth while everyone else including Microsoft and Bing were  growing at double digits.</p><p>So this is a really good deal for Verizon.  They'll be able to unlock a lot  of value from this. And that is why I don't think any other birders could  come close to the $4.8 billion.</p><p>But it's important to note, that Marissa Mayer has not done well with this  company at all.  What she did is she actually bought Tumblr for a billion  dollars and guess what -- had to write down the entire company value and  they used Facebook's ad platform right now.</p><p>So she said -- even said I will not mess this up.  And that is all she has  done this entire time.  So shareholders are going to rejoice right now  because they were given a negative equity value to the core Yahoo business  but this is really going to firm up the shares before they open this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, Verizon's goal is to basically build an online  advertising competitor to the likes of Google and Facebook but if you look  at the share of the total digital and ad market out there it's about half  or more than half for Google and Facebook and it's in single digits if you  look at Yahoo.  And even the existing properties AOL which Verizon owns, it  is less than 2 percent at AOL, and at Yahoo it's only a little less than  3.5 percent.  So they have a long way to go if they think that they are  going to really take on the big dogs.  </p><p>KELLY:  I am glad you brought that up because what they have, though that  is so much more valuable is they actually have their wireless network where  they can actually have geo-positioning on their advertising so if I go to a  Rangers game they actually can pinpoint where I am at and serve custom ads  to me.</p><p>So that's a huge added value that advertisers are willing to pay up for  because it's going to be a more precise advertising especially a live  advertising.  So that is why this deal will be praised and they can gain  some more market share because that is worth more because digital  advertising is worth less than desktop advertising right now except when  you can pinpoint and do precise advertising like they're looking to do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that is why I have my location services turned off on my  phone because I don't want anybody knowing where I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the time.</p><p>Thanks very much.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  So do I.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Get this, you guys.  In a Tumblr post this morning  Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer says that she's planning to stay.  So she said she  is going to stay, you know Dagen brought this big payday she's going to get  when she leaves.  But what is her role going to be in this merger?  Do we  know -- Kevin?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Her next role is actually zero and you can see even Verizon  executives said that before the sale process even existed.  She's obviously  looked at her contract.  She sees that they're going to wait for her to  acquire then she can get her golden parachute and go.  But she should be  staying in this because protecting herself.</p><p>But one of the reasons why her contract was so much is that she actually  had all these Google options before they went to Alphabet that were about  to vest.  So in order to bring her on over they actually needed to  compensate her for it.</p><p>So I am actually more mad that she brought over Dick Castro, who -- from  Google, as well as bunch of her other cronies -- sycophantic maniacs that  weren't able to do anything and paid them.  She's destroyed a lot of  shareholder value and not only did she do it for herself but she did it for  her friends.</p><p>So I can see her doing this.  She bungled the Tumblr thing.  She's actually  bungled the sales effort.  She threw a giant party in Christmas time where  she's -- and spent a bunch of money wherein she was laying off, I don't  know, like I don't know -- maybe 10 percent, maybe 25 percent of the  workforce.</p><p>The culture there has been terrible.  So this is good news for everyone  that works at not only Verizon but also Yahoo because they're going to get  some good talent because you saw a bunch of talent leave Yahoo.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well -- ouch.  I like her.  I mean don't know, you know,  obviously the valuation plummeted under her performance and shareholders  have not done well.  But there you go -- wish her the best.</p><p>Kevin -- thank you.  </p><p>KELLY:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said she's going to get $50 million.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If they fire her.  If they terminate her she gets $50 million on  top of the 100 million that she's made so far running the company -- ended  up well, reducing the value of the company just to be kind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She says she is staying.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see what happens.</p><p>Up next, a major shake-up rocking the Democratic Party this morning amid a  new e-mail scandal -- yes, a new one -- just hours before the convention  kicks off in Philadelphia.  More on the disarray at the DNC.</p><p>We're live from Philadelphia this week.  </p><p>Later \"Live long and prosper\" at the box office.  The latest installment of  the \"Star Trek\" franchise kicks off its theater debut on a strong note.   More on the money behind the sci-fi favorite -- next.</p><p>Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UINDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Once again, here's Maria Bartiromo. </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Welcome back.  Good Monday  morning, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from the  Democratic National Convention here in Philadelphia.  It is Monday, July  25th.  Here are your top story's 7:30 AM on the East Coast, drama at the  Democratic National Convention, it hasn't even started yet, party  chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announcing she will resign after an  e-mail link shows the DNC favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders  throughout the primary season.  New poll showed Donald Trump got a  convention bounce meanwhile according to the CNN/ORC.  He has 44 percent  support to now Clinton's 39 percent.  Meanwhile, Clinton and her running  mate, Senator Tim Kaine, sitting down for their first interview last night,  and Kaine weigh in on the relationship between the White House and  congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIM KAINE, VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do.  I absolutely do.  I think  the house is going to remain a Republican.  He has, I think the margin will  be narrow.  Some of the big things that we have to do, immigration reform,  tax reform, mental health reform, criminal justice reform, they're only  going to get tough.  I think they're only going to get done probably with a  divided house scenario where each side got to give them something. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this raising new questions about party unity, Sanders is  set to address the convention tonight.  He's one of the key speakers  tonight.  His supporters, however, have been filling the streets of  Philadelphia with signs about Bernie.  The scary scene for the Dallas  Cowboy teams bus, meanwhile, no staffers were on the bus were injured.   We've got all the details coming up on this story as well.  Making happy  hour healthy?  Booze makers jumping on the healthy eating trend to draw in  new costumers.  And a big weekend at the box office to tell you about, Star  Trek fans went to the theaters in droves, details on the film sales coming  up. </p><p>Markets this morning, a fractionally higher, really edging higher in a  quiet morning ahead of a whole host of earnings and the -- big events for  the market, Dow Industrial expected to be up about seven points at the  opening this morning.  Later on in the week, investors will have a lot to  digest between economic data, a two day Fed meeting, a Bank of Japan  meeting, and a lot of earnings, particularly in the tech sector.  In  Europe, stocks are higher across the board this morning.  Take a look.   We've got the DAX Index up about 1 percent.  That's the leader index this  morning.  The CAC prompt in Paris and the FT 100 also up a fraction.  But  mixed performances overnight in Asia, take a look, as you could see  fractional moves, however, very much a mix story. </p><p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announcing that she will step down as DNC  chairwoman, this after WikiLeaks posted 20,000 hacked DNC e-mails on the  internet.  The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary  Clinton, then released a statement thanking her, quote, longtime friend for  her leadership, while revealing that Wasserman Schultz will serve as an  honorary chair of Clinton's campaign, so Hillary gave her a job.  Earlier  in the show, Dennis Kucinich offers some advice for Bernie Sanders in light  of this new development.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think Bernie Sanders should do more here. </p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, U.S. POLITICAN:  Well, I actually think that it's time for  him to consider withdrawing the endorsement, because it's not just about  him, it's about a movement that he represents which got 46 percent of the  votes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to talk more about it is congresswoman,  Carolyn Maloney.  Congressman, good to see you. </p><p>CAROLYN MALONEY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Should Bernie Sanders  withdraw that endorsement? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, Bernie Sanders support this election, and this convention  is not about e-mails.  It's about the issues, it's the economy, homeland  security, and I agree with Bernie when he said, forget the damn e-mails.   It's not about e-mails.  So, this is about, for us, at least, electing  Hillary Clinton president. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, because I think you make a really good  point in terms of what the issues are.  Look, Donald Trump has his  supporters, Hillary Clinton has her supporters, and they are loyalists on  both sides.  We know that.  And then there's this enormous group of  independents out there.  What do you think we're going to hear this week  and what can they say this week, all of the speakers, to actually lure in  the independents? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, Hillary Clinton, unlike her opponent has a lifetime of  experience, and you would hear this throughout the convention.  Ways that  she has helped our economy, helped our country, helped our people.  And  he's saying trust me, I'll do this, I'll do that.  She has details, factual  proposals on everything, from Renewable energy, to homeland security, to  the economy.  You'll see a deep contrast.  And not only a record of  achievements, but also her plans for the future, and how she proposes to  turn these plans into a reality.  And she has a history of working across  the aisle, as did her husband when he was president.  And we have the best  economy in my lifetime, 22 private sector jobs created, under President  Obama 14.8 million private sector jobs created.  And I've got to say that  you will see such unity and depth.  Bernie Sanders, quoting him again, my  top goal is electing Hillary Clinton president and defeating Donald Trump.   You will see a unified party.  Sure, there're some delegates that prefer  Bernie, but at the end of this convention we'll all have a big D on our  shirts, and we're going to be out there working hard to get her elected. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Unity inside that arena,  congresswoman, but certainly not outside in terms of the protesters,  because, again, if you look around and talk to people, they are here to  support Bernie Sanders.  They are not here to support Hillary Clinton.  Do  you worry that those Sanders supporters -- maybe they don't go vote for  Donald Trump, but they just won't vote at all because they don't trust her. </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I believe that they trust Bernie, and Bernie is supporting  her.  And Bernie's top goal is to elect Hillary Clinton president.  And I  know Bernie -- I'm good friends with him and with Hillary.  And I know him,  no one will work harder to advance the goals, and really he brought an  energy, a new idea, and a lot of excitement.  We had 30 million Americans  vote for this ticket, and vote for Democrats, and we'll be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why hasn't he called the dogs off?  I mean, literally, why  hasn't he called the dogs off?  You've got thousands of protesters outside  right now.  Should he tell supporters, hey, go home, let's not disrupt this  convention. </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I don't think they are disrupting it.  We're going to go to  the floor.  We're going to elect her.  We're going to go forward.  And it's  going to be a very deep convention.  You're going to have two president  speaking.  First lady, Michelle Obama, who's speeches were so good, they  were even quoted at the Republican Convention.  And even Republicans are  coming out for Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Mayor Bloomberg has come out for  her. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he does.</p><p>MALONEY:  Larry Rockefeller has come out for her.  You'll see a strong  contingent of Republicans for Hillary Clinton.  And our compared, half the  people stayed home at the Republican Convention.  Our people are here. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Bloomberg is not really a Republican.  He was a Democrat  then a Republican, now he's independent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shape-shifting politicians. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You mention Republicans endorsing  Hillary Clinton.  You had Hank Paulson, George W. Bush secretary of  treasury.  Who architected the TARP bailout of Wall Street.  You have Dick  Armitage, who architected the Iraq war.  The Wall Street bailout and the  Iraq war aren't exactly assets to Bernie Sanders supporters who don't like  Hillary Clinton for that very reason.  It seems as if she's ideologically  been all over the map at her campaign is indicating that.  She's gone very  left is the primary, associating herself against stray now.  Obviously,  doing things like saying she's for the $15 minimum wage.  But her record  and even her, to your point, her endorsement indicates that she really is  still this kind of product of big establishment special interests.  How do  you reconcile that? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, she has a record of achievement and she is very consistent.   She is pro-America.  She's pro-American people.  Instead of building walls,  she'll be tearing down walls for opportunity for all Americans.  Her whole  career, and I've worked with her for 20 years, as First Lady she expanded  health care to 8 million American children.  And I was even with here in  Beijing when she gave that famous speech that's still quoted today that  women's rights are human rights.  She was the first major politician to  speak up to the Chinese government on human rights, and really transformed  the way women's issues are discussed.  They elevated it to a national  level.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take so many good points, but I got to push back because the  viewers are going to say when you talk about human rights why did she take  money from countries that treat women horribly like a Saudi Arabia?  When  you talk about the economy, wages haven't moved in 10 years.  President  Obama has not seen one year of 3 percent economic growth under his watch.   Most people are saying, wow, I'm worried that I'm going to lose my job.  My  friends are going to lose their job, 10 years after the financial crisis.   You look at Obamacare, that's the one issue that business managers continue  to bring up.  That's the reason that they're not hiring more people because  it's just too expensive.  Regulation has shut businesses to the extent that  they're not hiring or investing in anything.  We see the business part of  the economy unable to spend any new money.  So, when you say a record of  achievement, that's just the economy.  I could move on to national security  as well, ISIS has gotten stronger on her watch.  How is she going to  differentiate herself from all of these failures? </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, we as Democrats are proud to speak about the record of  former president Clinton.  I didn't even hear George Bush's name mentioned  at the Republican Convention.  And when he left office, this country was  shedding 800,000 jobs a month.  He's last year in office they lost 4.5. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this is not about Bush.  This is Donald Trump or Hillary  Clinton. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALONEY:  Is about the economy, and policies that move this country forward  for all Americans.  And under President Obama we have seen consistent job  growth from that deep Republican valley to having gained 14.8 million  private sector jobs.  And a report that came out from Blinder at Princeton  shows the economy is consistently better under Democratic presence.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he's -- congresswoman, he's a Democrat, Alan Blinder. </p><p>MALONEY:  The stock market is up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SAYEGH:  The real people wages are down.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the wages -- but you have a.</p><p>MALONEY:  It's picking up the last two months.  And it's true we need to do  more in that area.  That's why she supports raising the minimum wage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fifteen dollars minimum wage.</p><p>MALONEY: . and supports growing small businesses, which are the major  employer for Americans in this country.  But if you compare the record, her  record is of solid achievement.  That's why she has earned the support of  Democrats, independents, Bernie Sanders.  She has earned the support of  many Republicans based on a record of helping people -- coping our economy.   She was part of the architect, and I would put her on this, on creating the  department of homeland security and creating anti-terrorism unit all across  our country, and reforming our whole system in -- of intelligence, which is  really the only way we can stop these attempts -- attempts on New York  since 9/11.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People don't trust her.</p><p>MALONEY:  But we stopped.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p><p>MALONEY:  Because of improved intelligence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, primarily.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, but voters don't trust her.  And you know her  personally, but the American people don't know her personally, and they  don't trust what they see, and they don't believe what she tell the  American people because she's lied to them before. </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, she has not, and she is trusted and she will be elected  president based on the merits.  She's not saying trust me, vote for me.   She's saying trust me look at my record, look what I've done, look at where  we're going, and this is how we're going to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  Pardon me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How surprised are you at how tight this race is?  You've got to  be just like, wow. </p><p>MALONEY:  I've got to tell you, I'm very surprised. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MALONEY:  But you've got to understand that I am a Hillary friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MALONEY: . and a fan and supporter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We understand.</p><p>MALONEY:  And the fact that they're so close is very surprising to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it's incredible.</p><p>MALONEY:  That's a 40-40.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MALONEY: . and 20 percent undecided. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why I asked you about independence.  Congressman, good  to see you.  Thank you so much, Congressman Maloney there.  Back in a  minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A fatal accident to report involving a Dallas  Cowboy's bus, Cheryl Casone with more and the headlines right now, Cheryl,  over to you. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWTORK:  Yeah, Maria, the bus which is a  fixture for Cowboys fans was carrying several team staffers when it  collided with a van on a Arizona highway about 180 miles northeast of  Phoenix.  Four people in the van were killed.  There were no Cowboy's  player on the bus, and none of the Cowboy staffers were injured.  They were  on their way to Las Vegas for a Cowboys fan event. </p><p>Well, switching gears, it was all about Star Trek Beyond this weekend, the  film coming in number one at the box office. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  No ship.  No crew.  How are we going to get out on  this one?</p><p>UINDENTIFIED MALE:  The impossible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The recent installment of the film series that tracks the journeys  of the Starship Enterprise, bringing in nearly $60 million in ticket sales,  knocking the Secret Life of Pets from the number one spot.  Tied for third  place with $21.6 million are Ghostbusters and Lights Out, and rounding up  the top five, Ice Age Collision Course.  And finally, I know its Monday, I  know it's early, you always hear that the booze is bad for you, so the  industry including some of the world's biggest makers of booze are rolling  out new drinks aim at consumers that want something healthy.  The Wall  Street Journal, big article about this today, says the new offerings will  include drinks that are gluten-free, vegan, all-natural or even alcohol  free.  Diageo, which of course is the world's largest spirit's maker,  recently announced that it's investing in a nonalcoholic distilled spirit,  they're calling it Seedlip.  Say that 10 times.  Maria, Seedlip, just to  let you know what this is, it's being use at a London bar to make a drink  that tastes like a gin and tonic, and -- but it's not.  Also on the menu,  non-alcoholic espresso martinis, and there's a lot more in the article, but  I don't have time to go to the whole list.  But, it's interesting.  Back to  you in Philadelphia. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Up next, no shortage of drama here at the Democratic National  convention this week.  Police are on high alert.  Protesters are taking to  the streets of Philadelphia, more on the escalating chaos at the convention  coming up.  And then later, cashing in on a 50 year rivalry, we are talking  to the owners in Philadelphia's iconic cheese steak shops, Philly cheese  steaks, how they're benefiting from the convention.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Police in Philadelphia are on high alert this week, preparing  for big protesters at the Democratic National Convention kicks off today.   Fox News Leland Vitter is on the ground on Philly with the very latest.   Leland, good morning to you. </p><p>LELAND VITTER, FOX NEWS:  Good morning to you, Maria.  We are on the  western front of the DNC complex, and the protest zone all is quiet, maybe  even silent over here.  To give you an idea the security preparations 4  miles of this stop they call no scale fencing, very difficult to get up.   And here by the protest zone they created a no man's land of sort here, so  if anybody is in the park protesting and tried to hop this red fence,  there's some defensible space here before getting in to the secure area.   This is Broad Street, the main drag world of protesters were yesterday.   There were more protesters out on Sunday at the DNC before it started, and  then at the RNC all week.  And they were angry about a couple things.  They  were talking a lot about the environment, and a lot about Bernie Sanders.  </p><p>Fired up, perhaps it's almost 100 degrees with the heat index out here, but  also because of the WikiLeaks e-mails saying this really proves what  they've been saying all along that the DNC and the primary process was  rigged and stacked against their man, Bernie Sanders.  Things yesterday  totally peaceful, that's in stark contrast to what everyone saw in 2000 at  the RNC in Philadelphia, when people were chaining themselves together and  then putting themselves across highway overpasses trying to disrupt rush- hour.  They certainly succeeded in disrupting rush-hour back in 2000.  So  far here haven't seen anything like that.  That, of course, though is the  big fear as we started rush-hour.  Number one of the DNC, Maria, whether  was the thunderstorms or people have just decided those aren't the tactics  they're going to use, things so far have been awfully quiet, back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Leland, thank you so much.  How will the protesting  impact a local business economy here in Philadelphia?  We want to bring in  the executive director of the greater Philadelphia chamber of commerce,  Matt Cabrey with us right now.  Matt, good to see you. </p><p>MATT CABREY, PHILADELPHIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR:  Great to  be here, Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  So, how big of an economic boost do you  think that the Democratic National Convention will be on filling in the  greater Philadelphia area? </p><p>CABREY:  Yes.  So this is significant, and that we expect to see an uptick  in some of what we call the expected industries.  You know, transportation,  tourism, hospitality sector, telecommunications, photography, event  production, things like that, but generally speaking we're managing  expectations well.  We'll definitely going to see an uptick compared to  last July, for example.  But we really could expect about a $300 to $400  thousand economic impact based on all the activities, because there are  costs associated with delivering a program like this as well.  So, it all  balances out.  The real upside is greater awareness.  When we get Greater  Philadelphia on the national and internationals stage it's really  beneficial.  So long-term, if we can get that message out about doing great  business in greater Philadelphia, it's really perfect. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in doing great business, you want to attract as many  businesses as possible.  How are you going to attract businesses to come up  and setup shop here in Philly? </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah, absolutely.  We reach out to them, we set up sessions, and  we basically articulate the great assets we have here, everything from our  talent, which is really key for us, to our transportation infrastructure,  our accessibility, our proximity.  Here's a great fun-fact for you, 60  percent of the U.S. population is accessible within two hours of Greater  Philadelphia, so if you're an industry that relies on distribution  channels, and you have goods and services that you're looking to  distribute, this is a great gateway into the Greater Philadelphia region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>CABREY: . for a European region company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this city.  It's a great city.  And you're right, it's  very accessible.</p><p>CABREY:  Absolutely. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Lots of fun. </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah.</p><p>SAYEGH:  We're enjoying it.  Thanks for the hospitality. </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah, absolutely.  Welcome. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said that some of the big revenue generators in the city  are what?  You said life-sciences. </p><p>CABREY:  Yeah.  Life-sciences is huge, and a lot of this goes back actually  to our history, so we are a very rich city as you know in history to which  our country was founded.  But it's also key to know that the first  hospital, the first university, the first pharmaceutical school was  establish here, and today that translates into a very robust R&amp;D life- sciences. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt, good to see you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>CABREY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt Cabrey joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, you're watching a special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

I can only speak to my campaign.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a  great shock to me. I think as I said, it's what we talked about six months  ago.

Take a look at the  performances. We see the FJ, CAC 40, and DAX index, the German DAX index up  almost 1 percent. </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning. And here with me to break it  all down, Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, Maverick PAC national co- chair, Morgan Ortagus, and republican strategist, Tony Sayegh. </p><p>Good to see you, everybody. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shall we kick it off, we get here and the first thing is  distraction. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that how do democrats say unity? That's how you say unity  for democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God. But we've got that coming up. </p><p>To join us this morning we've got a great line up.

Congressman Caroline  Maloney will be here. Former astronaut, husband of former Representative  Gabriel Gifford, and co-founder of American for Responsible Solutions, Mark  Kelly is joining us this morning. And former Michigan Governor and senior  of Correct the Record, a super PAC67 backing Hillary Clinton, Jennifer  Granholm will be with us as well. </p><p>Disorder at the DNC this morning. A major shakeup rocking the Democratic  Party emitted in the e-mail scandal just hours before the Democratic  national Convention kicks in Philadelphia. </p><p>Let's get right to Blake Burman, he's here in Philly with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Maria. God morning to you  as well. Debbie Wasserman Schulz will gather in the Democratic National  Conventional later today. She'll give a speech at some point this week.  Gavel it out on Thursday and that will be it. </p><p>For her is that the Democratic National Committee as Wasserman Schultz  yesterday resigned from the top post at the DNC. Of course, this is due to  the fallout of the WikiLeaks scandal. WikiLeaks over the weekend releasing  some 19,000 plus e-mails that showed during the primary process. </p><p>Top democratic officials, some of them favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie  Sanders even in some states trying to tip the scales towards Clinton.  Wasserman Schultz herself even had some choice words when describing  Sanders campaign manager. </p><p>Now, Hillary Clinton was asked about those e-mails over the weekend, in an  interview with 60 Minutes. I should note that she gave this interview  before Wasserman Schultz officially submitted her letter of resignation.  Hear now Hillary Clinton about the e-mails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  I didn't know anything about it and I haven't read any of those.  But I am adamantly opposed to anyone bringing religion into our political  process. </p><p>Again, I don't know anything. I don't know anything about -- about these e- mails. I haven't followed it. But I'm very proud of the campaign that I  ran. </p><p>I can't speak to what people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were singing. I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Donald Trump as you might was not staying silent during all of  this. He had several responses via Twitter. Among them I'll read you one  here, quote \"Because the democrats are in a total meltdown, but the biased  media will say how great they are doing. E-mail say the rigged system is  alive and well.\" </p><p>Of course, Maria, Trump has been saying that the system was rigged against  Bernie Sanders. He will try to use this to try to sway some Sanders to his  side, and in something that you can't make up, Maria. The theme here  tonight for the democrats, \"United together.\" Ted Cruz and all of that was  so last week. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true. I mean, so much conversation about last week,  and yet here we are kicking this often and this happens. Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman with the latest there. </p><p>I want to bring in former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a former  presidential candidate himself and Fox News contributor. Congressman, good  to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your reaction to the e-mail scandal, WikiLeaks releasing  20,000 e-mails and that's obviously it came to life. </p><p>KUCINICH:  What reflects the culture inside the Democratic National  Committee. And as such, I think that when you add up all of the things,  setting the debate schedule that was insufficient, that super delegates.  There's so many things which basically prove that this election was rigged  against Bernie Sanders. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think, now -- we were talking on the commercial break. You  think Bernie Sanders should do more. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I actually think that it's time for him to consider  withdrawing the endorsement. Because it's not just about him, it's about  the movement that he represents which had 46 percent of the votes for the  country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And it was that kind of conduct was totally dismissive of almost  half of the democratic voters. And you cannot have that kind of contempt  for voters. And I think Bernie, I would -- I think he ought to at least  consider withdrawing the endorsement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we've been talking and hearing from the Democratic  National Committee yesterday as this is happening, Tony Sayegh. They kept  saying, well, he wasn't going to win anyway. But the truth is we'll never  know that for sure. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, doesn't that confirm the whole idea that it was rigged in  the first place.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to make that -- to make that...</p><p>SAYEGH:  And the evolution is crazy, Maria. You and I were together  yesterday morning. At that point, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has just said  she's not going to speak at the convention. </p><p>By the end of the day, and Bernie Sanders interview had I think a lot to do  it. She was out as the head of the DNC. But, Congressman, I agree with you.  I think Bernie Sanders should be strong and may be reconsidering his  endorsement. It doesn't sound like he's going to do that though. But it  sounds like his followers are pretty darn mad. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, they are. And, you know, as a former candidate for  president, I can tell you that, you know, you cannot expect the people who  support you to just go lockstep when then you say. And so that, you know,  there's the Bernie movement is a little bit separate from what the  candidate might want to do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And I want to go back to what you just said, Maria, where the  DNC's excuse was he wasn't going to win anyways. In other words, their  conduct, actually help to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where Bernie  was locked up because the game was rigged. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. And remember when we were watching all of those  democrats, we were all scratching our heads saying, why are they doing it  when the playoffs are on. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are they doing it on a Saturday night when no one watches - - or Sunday night. I mean, they were all very low, you know, viewing night  when they did these debates.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  But, Congressman, don't  you think this is immedicable larger cultural problem within the DNC  within, you know, when Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, this  the second e-mail scandal in the past year with the Democratic Party. </p><p>But don't you think that the party itself needs to look and say, you know,  we have a cultural leadership problem here where we're allowing this  cronyism to go on and fair tactics to go on that if the Republican Party  did, we'd be skewered for doing this. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, that is true. But let's go one step further. This is a  whole new era where technology is impacting politics in a powerful way. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  This is the millennial will understand this better than anyone.  Because you don't put anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't expect to  have to read publicly. And so, the politicians are just getting caught up. </p><p>And I think caught up and I think that what it reflects is an older  political culture that a pre-internet and it hasn't really caught up.</p><p>And so, again, but there has to be some kind of and say this is not right.  This kind of politics cannot be -- cannot be -- cannot continue. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Congressman, I suspect that this has disturbed you as much as it  disturb me and others. The idea that it was revealed they were  contemplating using Bernie Sanders religious beliefs...</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes. </p><p>SAYEGH:  ... as a campaign issue. And at the time where particularly as  republicans were often demonized by our opponents for being racist, being  bigoted in some fashion. Certainly our presidential candidate today is  assail by those things. </p><p>Doesn't that reveal hypocrisy that they were actually willing to do it  against their own? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I think it goes a little bit worse than hypocrisy. Here's  why. The head of the DNC, Jewish, OK. And probably so. An that's a good  thing. But how can you have under lengths trying to trap somebody, you  know, about his religion which also happens to be Jewish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  I mean, it boggles the mind. And so, this is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The cultural problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of -- the e-mails was -- one of the officials basically  saying somebody needs to ask him, do you even believe in God. And then he  said, look, my peeps in West Virginia are going to -- that will really  resonate with them, you know. Maybe he is an Atheist. Now he's Jewish. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, you know, the question now is that the DNC believe in  fairness? Does the DNC believe in the Constitution of the United States and  Freedom of Religion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  Does the DNC believe in trying to unite the party? </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I wouldn't be surprise to see two campaigns to have sort of e- mails going back and forth. But I think the crucial difference here is not  that these are two campaigns. This is the Democratic National Committee  overtly planning how to take one of their candidates. </p><p>KUCINICH:  There's no way to defend us. It's indefensible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tonight, Bernie Sanders will speak. Tonight, we'll see what  he says. We'll see if he addresses this. That's' going to be something to  watch.</p><p>KUCINICH:  he's going to need to address.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And Michelle Obama, the First Lady will speak tonight. So,  we will be obviously covering that. Congressman, good to see you. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. Congressman Kucinich there.  We will be live from the Democratic National Convention tonight in  Philadelphia all week. Don't miss our special primetime coverage, I'll here  that off tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern, followed by Lou Dobbs and Trish Regan.  So, do join us for our special coverage tonight. </p><p>Meanwhile, we are following the breaking news out of a nightclub shooting  in Fort Myers, Florida. At last two people are dead, 17 injured. We will  bring you the very latest from this deadly shooting in Florida. </p><p>Yahoo, meanwhile may have finally found a new home in Verizon. Reports say  Verizon is set to announce the nearly $5 billion deal this morning.  Interesting to know that back in the day Microsoft was willing to pay $48  billion. Verizon will pay 5 billion. Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. A fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub early  this morning to report. Cheryl Casone with the story and the other  headlines right now in our New York headquarters. Cheryl, good morning to  you. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria. Well,  officials say that at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others  injured in a shooting outside of a Florida nightclub. This happened just  after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.</p><p>Gunshots ring out in the parking lot and at this hour there are two active  crime scenes that we know off. Authorities say that injuries range from  minor to life-threatening at this hour. </p><p>Three people have been taken into custody and the investigation is  continuing right now. We'll bring updates if we get them, Maris.</p><p>Also this today, a deadly heat wave continuing to blanket parts of the  United States. Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona who died  from the heat as near triple digit temperatures sports state from New York  all the way to California. </p><p>Cody's mom was hiking in the snowy mountains when he suffered a fatal heat  strike. This happened in Phoenix, Arizona. Across the country, Maria,  temperatures got in 100 today, in particular in New York, Philadelphia, and  Washington. The heat index could be much higher if you combine the  temperature and humidity. </p><p>And finally, in business headlines this morning, the long process is over.  It appears that Verizon has come out on top in the biddings for Yahoo.  Reports said that Verizon has agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo. That  report includes Yahoo's core internet business and its finance news and  sports sides along with some real estate from the company. </p><p>Maria, the deal expected to be announced today. Take a look at buzz stock,  Yahoo right now, Maria. The stock is flat, the pre-market, but Verizon is  up just lately. Back to you in Philadelphia. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to bring in the  CIO of Recon Capital, chief investment officer, Kevin Kelly. Kevin, good to  see you. What are your thoughts on this deal? I think it's just so  extraordinary that back in, you know, back in the, what was it, early 2000,  Microsoft made a bid of -- a bid of $48 billion for Yahoo. And here we are  looking at a deal $4.8 billion or 5 billion. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS CEO:  Yes. You're bringing up a great  point. I mean, Marissa Mayer as well as other regimes have actually  decrease shareholder value pretty significantly for Yahoo. But what's nice  to know is that this is finally over. </p><p>Shareholders actually wanted Verizon to complete this deal. You can see  with the stock they really weren't attributing any value to this core  Yahoo. Yahoo right now when you look at the share price, it's really  factoring in Alibaba in its share price. </p><p>So, this is great news for shareholders because they now they can move on  with it. But, I mean, Marissa Mayer said she would not mess up. The Tumbler  rock was a shame. She said the sales process would go smoothly. It was  anything but people didn't know what was her sale. You could but this, or  you could buy that, including the real estate the patents they didn't know.</p><p>So, this is a good deal, especially for Verizon. So, they thought Yahoo was  going to hold them up on the sales process and actually ask for more, but  this is a fair price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin, let me ask you. The other technology earnings really  going to be in headlines this week. That Apple coming out with earnings.  You've got Google parent Alphabet coming out. And I believe Amazon, is that  going to set the tone. What are you expecting from some of these high- profile tech names this week? </p><p>KELLY:  That will set the tone this week, especially when you actually have  over a dozen central banks making actions including the Federal Reserve  here. People are going to focus on the largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 and  that is tech. </p><p>So, people are going to start seeing how these managements are going to  guide going forward. When you look at the tech sector, it provides the  largest growth out of any sector as well. It has net cash on the balance  sheets so people are going to start going into these names if you start to  see dividends increase in the tech sector, which could be great for the  market this week. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. It's all about -- it's all about earnings and it's  about guidance, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes. And I wanted to just point out Marissa Mayer, she gets  terminated with this acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon. She gets $50 million.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's already earned 100 million in cash and other compensation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, it's a sweet payday for basically driving the company into  the ground. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fifty million.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Kevin.</p><p>Coming up, democratic party leaders facing outrage ahead of the convention  over leaked e-mails. And the Clinton campaign is pointing the fingers at  Russia. Russian hackers, that's next.</p><p>And then if you're in the market to buy a home, maybe it's fair to act  fast. Homes are selling faster than a year earlier. What you should do to  win the housing wars, straight ahead.</p><p>Back in a moment on Mornings with Maria, live from Philadelphia at the  Democratic National Convention.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. </p><p>Hillary Clinton reacting to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S.  diplomatic compound in Benghazi. That ahead of today's kickoff to the  Democratic national Convention. </p><p>Here's what she said in an interview to 60 Minutes last night when asked  about her responsibility there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  So, when this happened in Benghazi, I immediately stood up an  independent committee, distinguished Americans from the military civilian  experts. They came out and they said, you know, the ball was dropped in  security. And, you know, some of the decisions that were made probably  should have been rethought. </p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT:  But wasn't that your ball to  carry? </p><p>CLINTON:  No, it wasn't. It was not my fault to carry. It was there with --  read the -- read the reports. Read all of the reports all many hundreds of  pages of them including this latest one, which was a political exercise  from the very beginning. Those never reached me. Those never came to my  attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, Pete  Hegseth. He's also a Fox news contributor. Pete, your reaction to that.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, IRAQ &amp; AFGHANISTAN VETERAN:  Good morning. The reaction is  she continues to be sort of arrogantly dismissive of the entire team.  She'll say immediately, yes, I had some responsibility but no  responsibility. It never reached my level. </p><p>And I wish Scott Pelley had asked the real question about, well then why  did you lie to people, that to me the biggest scandal. </p><p>For a week afterwards you lied about what you knew to be the real reason  for the attack. But there was a political expedient narrative that you push  forward. He never asked that follow up question. I think she needs to  continue to be asked that question. Because she has no answer. </p><p>The evident shows she told her daughter one thing and then lied to the  families of the fallen and said something else. She has never taken  responsibility for this and never taken it seriously. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. I mean, you would think -- I mean, this was September 11,  2012. And they had this whole narrative that there was a video, and then  they sent Susan Rice out there on all the Sunday shows. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to his point, the most disgusting thing about it which she  still won't own is that the she told the family...</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... that very lie that was cooked up by the administration for  political purposes. And then when she talks about in the interview, it was  not my ball to carry in terms of the security... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's fault was it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... in the program. Right. You're running -- again.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's the Secretary of State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was the Secretary of State, how did you operate. how did you  behave in that leadership post and you expect the American people to vote  you to run the nation. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And then, you know, in any leader and organization when something  goes wrong the buck should stop with the leader. And this is what I was  talking to earlier about my point of this culture within her campaign in  the DNC. </p><p>That I think the story would have been a lot sooner if she would have just  said I was the Secretary of State, ultimately it's my responsibility. But  the fact that she still can't take any responsibility as why this narrative  keeps going and going and going. And I don't know why she doesn't get it.  You're in charge, take responsibility. </p><p>HEGSETH:  That's exactly right. Leaders assert themselves in times of  difficulty not fade to the background which is exactly what she did hiding  behind other people. There's a scandal before this current scandal during  Benghazi and the scandal afterwards is what we still need to pin her down  on because she's never been able to explain why she lied. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And no one will forget the famous quote at this point when she  was testifying to Congress what difference does it make at this point. </p><p>Let me move on to this WikiLeaks dump of 20,000 e-mails. Hillary Clinton's  campaign is pointing fingers at Russian hackers for the DNC e-mail scandal  ahead of the convention. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is disturbing to us is that we, experts are  telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these e- mails. And other experts are now saying that they are -- the Russian are  releasing these e-mails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump. </p><p>I don't think it's coincidental that these e-mails were released on the eve  of our convention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know. To help Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They have theories that Donald Trump is pro-Putin and as a result  Putin state actors are working to poured out e-mails to the DNC. Again,  they're trying to obfuscate confuse create a counter narrative for the  irresponsibility and their inability to secure...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's still on tough election right now. Putin is in re-election  at the moment which is quite tough, you know, in Russia? So, I think he has  his own affairs to worry about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She still insists which she went of her way to point out in the  60 Minutes interview that her e-mail server, that her e-mails weren't  compromise. Well, we'll wait and see if that's the case because if the  server was hacked you know those e-mails are going to show up.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, but this whole leak is so really dangerous for the  DNC because the truth is now everything they say, I don't know, people are  questioning. Because it's like, well, you just created a narrative yourself  that Bernie Sanders might not be Jewish and then he's an Atheist. </p><p>So, now I'm going to believe this new narrative that you've just come up  with that Donald Trump is behind somehow this DNC leaked? I mean, it's hard  to believe anything now. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Indeed. And from the media as well as you see collusion with the  media on the stories they're running in by Politico and elsewhere. Hey,  does this make sense. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Vogel for Politico actually showed them his story before he  published. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes. But, doesn't it fit the narrative that Donald Trump is that  they're lying to you? That it's all of a fussed; this is exactly what this  does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I feel I love the fact that one woman in the Democratic Party  lost her job over an e-mail scandal and another one gets nominated to run  for president. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. All right. We will -- well, there you go. Pete and Dagen,  great insights. Pete Hegseth there.</p><p>A rocky start to the Democratic National Convention for sure as protesters  take to the streets before the official kick off. </p><p>More on what to expect live on the ground from Philly.

Key speakers tonight include  first lady, Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Fox News's Doug McKelway is live in Philly with a preview.  Doug, good  morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Morning Maria, and there's been a bit of breaking  news from the Democratic National Convention this morning.  They have  announced that the keynote speaker for tonight will be Massachusetts  Senator Elizabeth Warren.  This is probably a very, very sound decision by  the DNC.</p><p>As you know, Elizabeth Warren has been an attacked dog nipping at heels of  Donald Trump.  Throughout this campaign she goes head-to-head with him in  Twitter wars, and matches insult for insult.  And so, in that sense, it  will probably a very -- be a very effective strategy in trying to divert  attention from the story DuJour of the Democratic National Convention.  The  story of the convention, thus far, which is the e-mail scandal and the  resignation of Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p><p>She has come to a bit of a soft landing in the sense.  She has been picked  up by the Clinton campaign to serve as an honorary co-chairman.  But the  damage has been done, and her resignation is something that had to be done,  because -- simply to see her coming out on this stage, you know, walk out  on a daze (ph) in front of all these delegates to face a chorus of boos in  a way that Ted Cruz faced, of course, the boos when is he failed to  introduce Donald Trump and to support Donald Trump at the Republican  convention.  Something they did not want to see repeated here.</p><p>Clinton has been successful in alienating herself from the scandal as well  as she told \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE:  I don't know anything about these e- mails, I haven't followed it.  But I am very proud of the campaign that I  ran.  I can't speak to people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were saying, I can't speak to that.  I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  For his part, Bernie Sanders has remained remarkably calm  throughout this scandal.  His convention speech also scheduled to be  delivered tonight.  Will be chock-full of insults directed at Donald Trump,  compliments directed towards Hillary Clinton but he won't be firing away  from within the Democratic tent, perhaps because he is long suspected a  conspiracy to deprive him of the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a great shock to  me.  It's what we talked about six months ago.  I mean, there's no question  to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that  the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton, was in opposition to our campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Those allegiances of Bernie Sanders supporters are not being as  gentle as that thousands gathered on the streets of downtown Philadelphia  yesterday to protest.  It was a larger gathering than anything we saw.</p><p>In Cleveland, albeit, it was a peaceful demonstration.  They'll be moving  up to this neck of the woods today about 20 miles north of where they  protested yesterday to FDR Park.</p><p>The impressive thing about their appearance there yesterday was, they came  out in intense heat and humidity, did not dissuade them did at all.  Today,  a different situation, we had downpours here in Philadelphia.  We'll see if  they've been able -- if they will be able to withstand that.  Maria, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug thanks so much.  Doug McKelway there -- here in  Philly with us.  How will the DNC e-mail leak impact day one and the views  of delegates and voters.</p><p>I want to bring in former advisor to President Bill Clinton and co-author  of the new book, \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat Hillary\" and that is, of  course, Dick Morris.  Dick, good to see you.</p><p>DICK MORRIS, ARMAGEDDON AUTHOR:  Good to be here with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think?  What's the impact of all this?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think that it's notable that Trump went out of his way to  appease the conservatives in his party who he largely defeated by naming  Pence.  And Hillary went out of her way to name Kaine, who is clearly not a  liberal and does nothing to placate Sanders and Warren.</p><p>So when Sanders and Warren addressed the convention tonight, the big thing  we'll notice is that they would not chosen to be vice president.  And in a  sense -- no matter how attractive they are, people are saying that shows  that their views and Hillary's are fundamentally different.  So I think it  really casts a shadow over the whole thing.  But, you know Maria, it can  get worse.  When .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you mean it can -- how is it going to get worse?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, when a bomb hits you, you wonder if the plane is still  overhead.  And on June 14th, there was a leak from anonymous sources in  Russia, probably the Kremlin, that they possessed a number of Hillary's  state department e-mails.  And that they may release them at a time that  might be inconvenient to Hillary, and that's something to keep your eye on  all convention.  Because that would establish that the e-mail server was  hacked and was hacked by our enemies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  That's really interesting, Dagen, because this whole  time she is saying we weren't hacked, everything is fine.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Which in the interview with \"60 Minutes\"  she went out of her way to make that point and put an exclamation on the  discussion about that very e-mail server.</p><p>I want to ask Dick this in terms of a Tim Kaine picked The Wall Street  Journal editorial page, essentially says that Tim Kaine is a pick for when  she wins, so -- and when she begins to govern, that she seems to be so  confident in getting the far left vote, and in getting the votes that -- of  Sanders or Warren would appeal to, that she's basically skipping November  and going right to governing starting in January with Tim Kaine.</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I can't think that she is that na[ve.  I think there's a  different explanation for Tim Kaine.  You're right.  It's confounding as a  political proposition.  But I think that the key is Tim Kaine's letter that  he sent to the banks three days before he was nominated, avowing that he  would opposed stricter regulation of the big banks.</p><p>Now, normally when you're on a short list for V.P. you keep your mouth  shut.  But he overtly sent that letter, and I think it was to get the banks  to lobby Hillary to put him on the ticket.  And I think that what you are  seeing here is Hillary reassuring her financial controllers that she's  still on the reservation by picking Kaine.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PACK NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Dick, good morning.  This  is Morgan.  I'm wondering, what can Bernie Sanders say tonight?  And the  comparison that I'm thinking it was four years ago, Bill Clinton sort of  saved Barack Obama in his reelection by giving that powerful speech at the  convention.  Do you expect Bernie Sanders to pull a Bill Clinton four years  ago or a Ted Cruz last week when it comes to Hillary Clinton tonight?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think it will be a Bernie.  And I think he will use the  opportunity to articulate again his points of view.  I think he'll attract  Trump aggressively.  I think he'll mildly praise Hillary.  But I think that  the real point here is that his voters are the swing the vote in this  election.</p><p>Try to make that point in -- on again, in my book.  The Republicans can run  not just with the right jab, doing the conservative issues but they need to  throw a left hook coming around Hillary and talking to the Sanders voters  in the rear.  And I think Trump did a very good job of that in his speech.   And I think this e-mail scandal and the choice of Kaine both of which  essentially to have lifted the Democratic Party to stop it, really  undermine Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's been trying to do that.  You know, Trump trying to reach  out to those Bernie Sanders voters and Hillary is being forced to defend  the multiple scandals surrounding her and her entire political record.  She  gave that first interview with the V.P. choice Senator Kaine, and Clinton  claimed that she is judged on a different standard than others are judged.   Listen to this Dick Morris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I think that it is fair to say there has been a concerted effort  to convince people like that young man of something.  Nobody is quite sure  what but of something.  I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and  then there's the standard for everybody else.</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, \"60 MINUTES\" HOST:  What's the Hillary standard?</p><p>CLINTON:  Well, it is, you know, a lot of as you saw at the Republican  Convention, unfounded, inaccurate, main spirited attacks with no basis in  truth reality which take on a life of their own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORRIS:  Well .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think?  Is there a Hillary standard?</p><p>MORRIS:  I'm glad his speech writer didn't call it a vast right-wing  conspiracy.  May be they used that one already.  But I think that -- yeah,  when somebody comes out of a bar at night, they had a nice drink.  When the  guy has five DUI (ph), there's a question to whether they shouldn't have  been in that bar in the first place, and that is the Hillary standard.</p><p>But I think that it is -- when we look at this convention, Donald Trump  used this convention to show who Donald Trump is.  He was front and center  of his family, his wife, his kids.  Hillary is going to use this convention  to hide herself.  She is not running.  The first woman is running.  She's  not running, pro-choice is running and pro-gun control.  She's the only  person between Donald Trump and the presidency.</p><p>And in .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great analysis, yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  . in fact she advances through generic rather than through the  specific of her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, that's a great point.  You know, and maybe (ph) she might  also have created that standard for herself by just doing things like, oh,  I am going to -- you have my own e-mail server, because that's what I'm  going to do and nobody else can do that.</p><p>TONY SAYEGH, JAMESTOWN ASSOCIATES:  The most of these in part of that  interview was she said that all these concerns about her honesty  untrustworthiness were baseless.  Meanwhile, we know from the Clinton  Foundation contribution for foreign government, the server and et cetera,  but Delegates County saying, you've known Hillary Clinton for decades.  You  advise the Clintons a long time ago.  Has Hillary changed or is this the  same Hillary you sat down with face to face when you first met the  Clinton's back.  I believe it was in the 80's.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  Real quick, Dick.</p><p>MORRIS:  I think best say to say it, she's metastasized.  In the beginning,  there was the incipient dishonesty, there was the incipient paranoia and  secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  There was the incipient dishonesty corruption but it's grown.   It's metastasized.  It's taken her over.  You know a person from 70 years  old, you knew when they were 30, and you could see them going off the track  but not that much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  But then a 60s and 70s you say, oh, my god, look at what they've  become, that's Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know them really well.  And Dick, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MORRIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, quite morning in terms of futures.  Take a look,  we're really not far from where the market finished the day yesterday, and  yet earnings really driving the story.  Handful of names on the new this  morning.</p><p>SolarCity is (inaudible) higher.  The company reportedly closed to emerge  their deal with Tesla.

Musk has refused himself from voting on this deal.</p><p>We'll continue to track the latest development following a fatal explosion  in Germany yesterday.   Cheryl Casone with that right now and the other  head lines from our New York headquarters.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yeah, that's right Maria.  The various  interior minister says he believes the incident was likely an Islamist  suicide attack.  Police say a 27-year old Syrian man blew himself up after  he was turned away from an open air music festival in Ansbach.</p><p>Police believe the man who killed himself was motivated after being denied  asylum in Germany.  He was already known to them for a recent drug  misdemeanor.  At least 12 others were injured in the suicide attack.</p><p>We'll here at home.  A wildfire in Southern California, destroying 18 homes  and rapidly gaining straight two days after it broke out.  The fire being  described as a freight train by some setting so much smoke into the air  that planes making water drops on it, had to be grounded (ph) at one point.   Thousands of people forced to evacuate.</p><p>This fire Maria has burned at least 34 square miles but fire officials say  that size may now have doubled.  Of course, it's dark in California.  We'll  see what happens when the sun comes up this morning.</p><p>And finally, the housing market, showing signs of improvement.  (Inaudible)  said that homes are selling an average of a week faster than they did just  one year ago.  This is the supply of nearly 5 percent lower than last year.   Homes are being sold after about 78 days on the market.  The average U.S.  home is currently worth $187,000, Maria, that's a 5.4 percent increase from  June of last year.  That's for prices from 2015.</p><p>But Maria, remember, that we're also looking about 3.5 percent for the 30- year fixed year mortgage right now, that's also affecting sales.  Back to  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Spotlight on technology  this week, setting the stage on market.  Coming up, we're going to preview  the week.  We'll tell you what to expect, out of a whole host (ph) of  earnings within the tech sector.</p><p>Plus, we're coming to you live from Democratic National Convention here in  Philadelphia.  We'll tell about what to expect as the DNC kicks off today.   Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's check market this morning with a lot of  earnings coming out this weekend some economic data that will certainly set  the tone and the Fed.  Two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve is having this  week.</p><p>Ahead of all of that, the market is looking fractionally higher.  It keeps  going back and forth though between positive and negative territory, this  following another record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Investors are gearing up for a slow of Vect (ph) technology earning  including S&amp;P components, Apple which is also a Dow component, reporting  earnings  tomorrow.  Facebook is out on Wednesday.  Amazon is out and Google parent  Alphabet are out with their results on Thursday.</p><p>This is going to be a big week.  You also have a two-day Federal Reserve  meeting which ends on Wednesday.  We're not going to see rates move higher  but we're going to be focused on the language out of the Fed, and what they  say or suggest about the next meeting.</p><p>Recon Capital Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Kelley with us standing by in  our New York studios.  Technology earnings should set the tone, what do you  expect on earnings?  Is the Fed a factor?  What drives market this week,  Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN KELLEY, RECON CAPITAL CIO:  It's going to be a very, very wild week  especially for the Nasdaq 100.  You're going to have about 40 percent of  the companies reporting this week alone.  So that's going to dictate a lot  of the market action.</p><p>And as you alluded to earlier, the big tech names are really going to drive  that but also biotech will be reporting this week as well.  And you're  seeing a lot of these names, are big growers in their space, except for  Apple.  Apple is expected to have 22 to 25 percent revenue decline and  that's because of the refreshed cycle on the iPhone.</p><p>So, we're going to have to see where software and services going that route  but you're seeing all the other names including Facebook, Amazon.  You're  seeing their growth be pretty significant, above 20 percent on the top line  revenue growth and 15 percent on the earnings growth.</p><p>So people are really going to be focused on that, because companies are  going to give their guidance, but it's expected to do very well.  And these  are companies that are giving a good value.  So when you look at the tech  sector alone, it's training in a 20 perfect discount to its forward  earnings on a historical basis.  So, people maybe getting into this and  really actually help make this sector move higher and move the overall  market higher this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even Amazon?  That's the company that's -- not going to cover  up the flow (ph), right Dagen?  That stock is up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Price is up -- maybe price for perfection and the question is,  in terms of the forward-looking earnings are those estimates wrong?  Do  they need to come down because that made -- that could make the stocks not  look like .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not beating (ph) against Amazon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Apple is down 6 percent this year.  It really  fell off a cliff.  It's come back a little bit but in terms of potential  upside there, I've heard people talking about that.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yeah .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With Amazon -- yeah.</p><p>KELLEY:  It's really limited upside on Apple but -- just so you know on the  Amazon front, Amazon is a great company that hasn't really focused on  earnings.  They've really focused on revenue growth.  So when people start  talking about a fundamental basis and their earnings, you can't focus on  that, because what they could do is they could actually slash all of their  expenditures and really make it into a great value stock if they wanted to  but they're not focused on that.  That's why you're seeing in perform  quarter over quarter on a basis.  That's why you're seeing lead even in the  Cloud space.</p><p>So, their Amazon is going to be a company that ends up being a Cloud  company that happens to have an eCommerce platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  You know what?  Investors have not been bothered by that  that they focus on revenue growth.  They keep buying the stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They can hold their nose only so long and then they have to  breath through their nose and look out block (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  Kevin, any other highlights from your standpoint?   Do you care about the Fed, Tuesday, Wednesday?</p><p>KELLEY:  I don't think the Fed is really muted right now especially because  people are not expecting a move, and if they are expecting a move they're  looking it to be in December or early next year.  So people -- investors  aren't really focused on that, and they're not even focused on the bank of  Japan either because of the move last month.</p><p>So, people were going to be focused on the market.  Yup, exactly.  All  about earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I think (ph) the Japan, is on Friday.  All right, Kevin,  thank you.</p><p>We are awaiting big news this morning form month all about earnings from  Verizon reports out that say it is going to be completing inking a $5  billion deal to acquire Yahoo.  What it means for CEO Marissa Mayer and  shareholders of Yahoo and Verizon.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz is out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that how do democrats say unity? That's how you say unity  for democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.

A major shakeup rocking the Democratic  Party emitted in the e-mail scandal just hours before the Democratic  national Convention kicks in Philadelphia. </p><p>Let's get right to Blake Burman, he's here in Philly with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Maria. God morning to you  as well. Debbie Wasserman Schulz will gather in the Democratic National  Conventional later today. She'll give a speech at some point this week.  Gavel it out on Thursday and that will be it. </p><p>For her is that the Democratic National Committee as Wasserman Schultz  yesterday resigned from the top post at the DNC. Of course, this is due to  the fallout of the WikiLeaks scandal. WikiLeaks over the weekend releasing  some 19,000 plus e-mails that showed during the primary process. </p><p>Top democratic officials, some of them favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie  Sanders even in some states trying to tip the scales towards Clinton.  Wasserman Schultz herself even had some choice words when describing  Sanders campaign manager. </p><p>Now, Hillary Clinton was asked about those e-mails over the weekend, in an  interview with 60 Minutes. I should note that she gave this interview  before Wasserman Schultz officially submitted her letter of resignation.  Hear now Hillary Clinton about the e-mails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  I didn't know anything about it and I haven't read any of those.  But I am adamantly opposed to anyone bringing religion into our political  process. </p><p>Again, I don't know anything. I don't know anything about -- about these e- mails. I haven't followed it. But I'm very proud of the campaign that I  ran. </p><p>I can't speak to what people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were singing. I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Donald Trump as you might was not staying silent during all of  this. He had several responses via Twitter. Among them I'll read you one  here, quote \"Because the democrats are in a total meltdown, but the biased  media will say how great they are doing. E-mail say the rigged system is  alive and well.\" </p><p>Of course, Maria, Trump has been saying that the system was rigged against  Bernie Sanders. He will try to use this to try to sway some Sanders to his  side, and in something that you can't make up, Maria. The theme here  tonight for the democrats, \"United together.\" Ted Cruz and all of that was  so last week. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true. I mean, so much conversation about last week,  and yet here we are kicking this often and this happens. Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman with the latest there. </p><p>I want to bring in former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a former  presidential candidate himself and Fox News contributor. Congressman, good  to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your reaction to the e-mail scandal, WikiLeaks releasing  20,000 e-mails and that's obviously it came to life. </p><p>KUCINICH:  What reflects the culture inside the Democratic National  Committee. And as such, I think that when you add up all of the things,  setting the debate schedule that was insufficient, that super delegates.  There's so many things which basically prove that this election was rigged  against Bernie Sanders. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think, now -- we were talking on the commercial break. You  think Bernie Sanders should do more. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I actually think that it's time for him to consider  withdrawing the endorsement. Because it's not just about him, it's about  the movement that he represents which had 46 percent of the votes for the  country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And it was that kind of conduct was totally dismissive of almost  half of the democratic voters. And you cannot have that kind of contempt  for voters. And I think Bernie, I would -- I think he ought to at least  consider withdrawing the endorsement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we've been talking and hearing from the Democratic  National Committee yesterday as this is happening, Tony Sayegh. They kept  saying, well, he wasn't going to win anyway. But the truth is we'll never  know that for sure. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, doesn't that confirm the whole idea that it was rigged in  the first place.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to make that -- to make that...</p><p>SAYEGH:  And the evolution is crazy, Maria. You and I were together  yesterday morning. At that point, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has just said  she's not going to speak at the convention. </p><p>By the end of the day, and Bernie Sanders interview had I think a lot to do  it. She was out as the head of the DNC. But, Congressman, I agree with you.  I think Bernie Sanders should be strong and may be reconsidering his  endorsement. It doesn't sound like he's going to do that though. But it  sounds like his followers are pretty darn mad. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, they are. And, you know, as a former candidate for  president, I can tell you that, you know, you cannot expect the people who  support you to just go lockstep when then you say. And so that, you know,  there's the Bernie movement is a little bit separate from what the  candidate might want to do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And I want to go back to what you just said, Maria, where the  DNC's excuse was he wasn't going to win anyways. In other words, their  conduct, actually help to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where Bernie  was locked up because the game was rigged. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. And remember when we were watching all of those  democrats, we were all scratching our heads saying, why are they doing it  when the playoffs are on. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are they doing it on a Saturday night when no one watches - - or Sunday night. I mean, they were all very low, you know, viewing night  when they did these debates.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  But, Congressman, don't  you think this is immedicable larger cultural problem within the DNC  within, you know, when Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, this  the second e-mail scandal in the past year with the Democratic Party. </p><p>But don't you think that the party itself needs to look and say, you know,  we have a cultural leadership problem here where we're allowing this  cronyism to go on and fair tactics to go on that if the Republican Party  did, we'd be skewered for doing this. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, that is true. But let's go one step further. This is a  whole new era where technology is impacting politics in a powerful way. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  This is the millennial will understand this better than anyone.  Because you don't put anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't expect to  have to read publicly. And so, the politicians are just getting caught up. </p><p>And I think caught up and I think that what it reflects is an older  political culture that a pre-internet and it hasn't really caught up.</p><p>And so, again, but there has to be some kind of and say this is not right.  This kind of politics cannot be -- cannot be -- cannot continue. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Congressman, I suspect that this has disturbed you as much as it  disturb me and others. The idea that it was revealed they were  contemplating using Bernie Sanders religious beliefs...</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes. </p><p>SAYEGH:  ... as a campaign issue. And at the time where particularly as  republicans were often demonized by our opponents for being racist, being  bigoted in some fashion. Certainly our presidential candidate today is  assail by those things. </p><p>Doesn't that reveal hypocrisy that they were actually willing to do it  against their own? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I think it goes a little bit worse than hypocrisy. Here's  why. The head of the DNC, Jewish, OK. And probably so. An that's a good  thing. But how can you have under lengths trying to trap somebody, you  know, about his religion which also happens to be Jewish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  I mean, it boggles the mind. And so, this is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The cultural problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of -- the e-mails was -- one of the officials basically  saying somebody needs to ask him, do you even believe in God. And then he  said, look, my peeps in West Virginia are going to -- that will really  resonate with them, you know. Maybe he is an Atheist. Now he's Jewish. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, you know, the question now is that the DNC believe in  fairness? Does the DNC believe in the Constitution of the United States and  Freedom of Religion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  Does the DNC believe in trying to unite the party? </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I wouldn't be surprise to see two campaigns to have sort of e- mails going back and forth. But I think the crucial difference here is not  that these are two campaigns. This is the Democratic National Committee  overtly planning how to take one of their candidates. </p><p>KUCINICH:  There's no way to defend us. It's indefensible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tonight, Bernie Sanders will speak. Tonight, we'll see what  he says. We'll see if he addresses this. That's' going to be something to  watch.</p><p>KUCINICH:  he's going to need to address.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And Michelle Obama, the First Lady will speak tonight. So,  we will be obviously covering that. Congressman, good to see you. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. Congressman Kucinich there.  We will be live from the Democratic National Convention tonight in  Philadelphia all week. Don't miss our special primetime coverage, I'll here  that off tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern, followed by Lou Dobbs and Trish Regan.  So, do join us for our special coverage tonight. </p><p>Meanwhile, we are following the breaking news out of a nightclub shooting  in Fort Myers, Florida. At last two people are dead, 17 injured. We will  bring you the very latest from this deadly shooting in Florida. </p><p>Yahoo, meanwhile may have finally found a new home in Verizon. Reports say  Verizon is set to announce the nearly $5 billion deal this morning.  Interesting to know that back in the day Microsoft was willing to pay $48  billion. Verizon will pay 5 billion. Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. A fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub early  this morning to report. Cheryl Casone with the story and the other  headlines right now in our New York headquarters. Cheryl, good morning to  you. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria. Well,  officials say that at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others  injured in a shooting outside of a Florida nightclub. This happened just  after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.</p><p>Gunshots ring out in the parking lot and at this hour there are two active  crime scenes that we know off. Authorities say that injuries range from  minor to life-threatening at this hour. </p><p>Three people have been taken into custody and the investigation is  continuing right now. We'll bring updates if we get them, Maris.</p><p>Also this today, a deadly heat wave continuing to blanket parts of the  United States. Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona who died  from the heat as near triple digit temperatures sports state from New York  all the way to California. </p><p>Cody's mom was hiking in the snowy mountains when he suffered a fatal heat  strike. This happened in Phoenix, Arizona. Across the country, Maria,  temperatures got in 100 today, in particular in New York, Philadelphia, and  Washington. The heat index could be much higher if you combine the  temperature and humidity. </p><p>And finally, in business headlines this morning, the long process is over.  It appears that Verizon has come out on top in the biddings for Yahoo.  Reports said that Verizon has agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo. That  report includes Yahoo's core internet business and its finance news and  sports sides along with some real estate from the company. </p><p>Maria, the deal expected to be announced today. Take a look at buzz stock,  Yahoo right now, Maria. The stock is flat, the pre-market, but Verizon is  up just lately. Back to you in Philadelphia. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to bring in the  CIO of Recon Capital, chief investment officer, Kevin Kelly. Kevin, good to  see you. What are your thoughts on this deal? I think it's just so  extraordinary that back in, you know, back in the, what was it, early 2000,  Microsoft made a bid of -- a bid of $48 billion for Yahoo. And here we are  looking at a deal $4.8 billion or 5 billion. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS CEO:  Yes. You're bringing up a great  point. I mean, Marissa Mayer as well as other regimes have actually  decrease shareholder value pretty significantly for Yahoo. But what's nice  to know is that this is finally over. </p><p>Shareholders actually wanted Verizon to complete this deal. You can see  with the stock they really weren't attributing any value to this core  Yahoo. Yahoo right now when you look at the share price, it's really  factoring in Alibaba in its share price. </p><p>So, this is great news for shareholders because they now they can move on  with it. But, I mean, Marissa Mayer said she would not mess up. The Tumbler  rock was a shame. She said the sales process would go smoothly. It was  anything but people didn't know what was her sale. You could but this, or  you could buy that, including the real estate the patents they didn't know.</p><p>So, this is a good deal, especially for Verizon. So, they thought Yahoo was  going to hold them up on the sales process and actually ask for more, but  this is a fair price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin, let me ask you. The other technology earnings really  going to be in headlines this week. That Apple coming out with earnings.  You've got Google parent Alphabet coming out. And I believe Amazon, is that  going to set the tone. What are you expecting from some of these high- profile tech names this week? </p><p>KELLY:  That will set the tone this week, especially when you actually have  over a dozen central banks making actions including the Federal Reserve  here. People are going to focus on the largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 and  that is tech. </p><p>So, people are going to start seeing how these managements are going to  guide going forward. When you look at the tech sector, it provides the  largest growth out of any sector as well. It has net cash on the balance  sheets so people are going to start going into these names if you start to  see dividends increase in the tech sector, which could be great for the  market this week. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. It's all about -- it's all about earnings and it's  about guidance, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes. And I wanted to just point out Marissa Mayer, she gets  terminated with this acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon. She gets $50 million.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's already earned 100 million in cash and other compensation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, it's a sweet payday for basically driving the company into  the ground. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fifty million.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Kevin.</p><p>Coming up, democratic party leaders facing outrage ahead of the convention  over leaked e-mails. And the Clinton campaign is pointing the fingers at  Russia. Russian hackers, that's next.</p><p>And then if you're in the market to buy a home, maybe it's fair to act  fast. Homes are selling faster than a year earlier. What you should do to  win the housing wars, straight ahead.</p><p>Back in a moment on Mornings with Maria, live from Philadelphia at the  Democratic National Convention.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. </p><p>Hillary Clinton reacting to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S.  diplomatic compound in Benghazi. That ahead of today's kickoff to the  Democratic national Convention. </p><p>Here's what she said in an interview to 60 Minutes last night when asked  about her responsibility there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  So, when this happened in Benghazi, I immediately stood up an  independent committee, distinguished Americans from the military civilian  experts. They came out and they said, you know, the ball was dropped in  security. And, you know, some of the decisions that were made probably  should have been rethought. </p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT:  But wasn't that your ball to  carry? </p><p>CLINTON:  No, it wasn't. It was not my fault to carry. It was there with --  read the -- read the reports. Read all of the reports all many hundreds of  pages of them including this latest one, which was a political exercise  from the very beginning. Those never reached me. Those never came to my  attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, Pete  Hegseth. He's also a Fox news contributor. Pete, your reaction to that.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, IRAQ &amp; AFGHANISTAN VETERAN:  Good morning. The reaction is  she continues to be sort of arrogantly dismissive of the entire team.  She'll say immediately, yes, I had some responsibility but no  responsibility. It never reached my level. </p><p>And I wish Scott Pelley had asked the real question about, well then why  did you lie to people, that to me the biggest scandal. </p><p>For a week afterwards you lied about what you knew to be the real reason  for the attack. But there was a political expedient narrative that you push  forward. He never asked that follow up question. I think she needs to  continue to be asked that question. Because she has no answer. </p><p>The evident shows she told her daughter one thing and then lied to the  families of the fallen and said something else. She has never taken  responsibility for this and never taken it seriously. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. I mean, you would think -- I mean, this was September 11,  2012. And they had this whole narrative that there was a video, and then  they sent Susan Rice out there on all the Sunday shows. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to his point, the most disgusting thing about it which she  still won't own is that the she told the family...</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... that very lie that was cooked up by the administration for  political purposes. And then when she talks about in the interview, it was  not my ball to carry in terms of the security... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's fault was it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... in the program. Right. You're running -- again.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's the Secretary of State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was the Secretary of State, how did you operate. how did you  behave in that leadership post and you expect the American people to vote  you to run the nation. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And then, you know, in any leader and organization when something  goes wrong the buck should stop with the leader. And this is what I was  talking to earlier about my point of this culture within her campaign in  the DNC. </p><p>That I think the story would have been a lot sooner if she would have just  said I was the Secretary of State, ultimately it's my responsibility. But  the fact that she still can't take any responsibility as why this narrative  keeps going and going and going. And I don't know why she doesn't get it.  You're in charge, take responsibility. </p><p>HEGSETH:  That's exactly right. Leaders assert themselves in times of  difficulty not fade to the background which is exactly what she did hiding  behind other people. There's a scandal before this current scandal during  Benghazi and the scandal afterwards is what we still need to pin her down  on because she's never been able to explain why she lied. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And no one will forget the famous quote at this point when she  was testifying to Congress what difference does it make at this point. </p><p>Let me move on to this WikiLeaks dump of 20,000 e-mails. Hillary Clinton's  campaign is pointing fingers at Russian hackers for the DNC e-mail scandal  ahead of the convention. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is disturbing to us is that we, experts are  telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these e- mails. And other experts are now saying that they are -- the Russian are  releasing these e-mails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump. </p><p>I don't think it's coincidental that these e-mails were released on the eve  of our convention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know. To help Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They have theories that Donald Trump is pro-Putin and as a result  Putin state actors are working to poured out e-mails to the DNC. Again,  they're trying to obfuscate confuse create a counter narrative for the  irresponsibility and their inability to secure...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's still on tough election right now. Putin is in re-election  at the moment which is quite tough, you know, in Russia? So, I think he has  his own affairs to worry about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She still insists which she went of her way to point out in the  60 Minutes interview that her e-mail server, that her e-mails weren't  compromise. Well, we'll wait and see if that's the case because if the  server was hacked you know those e-mails are going to show up.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, but this whole leak is so really dangerous for the  DNC because the truth is now everything they say, I don't know, people are  questioning. Because it's like, well, you just created a narrative yourself  that Bernie Sanders might not be Jewish and then he's an Atheist. </p><p>So, now I'm going to believe this new narrative that you've just come up  with that Donald Trump is behind somehow this DNC leaked? I mean, it's hard  to believe anything now. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Indeed. And from the media as well as you see collusion with the  media on the stories they're running in by Politico and elsewhere. Hey,  does this make sense. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Vogel for Politico actually showed them his story before he  published. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes. But, doesn't it fit the narrative that Donald Trump is that  they're lying to you? That it's all of a fussed; this is exactly what this  does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I feel I love the fact that one woman in the Democratic Party  lost her job over an e-mail scandal and another one gets nominated to run  for president. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. All right. We will -- well, there you go. Pete and Dagen,  great insights. Pete Hegseth there.</p><p>A rocky start to the Democratic National Convention for sure as protesters  take to the streets before the official kick off. </p><p>More on what to expect live on the ground from Philly.

Doug, good  morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Morning Maria, and there's been a bit of breaking  news from the Democratic National Convention this morning.  They have  announced that the keynote speaker for tonight will be Massachusetts  Senator Elizabeth Warren.  This is probably a very, very sound decision by  the DNC.</p><p>As you know, Elizabeth Warren has been an attacked dog nipping at heels of  Donald Trump.  Throughout this campaign she goes head-to-head with him in  Twitter wars, and matches insult for insult.  And so, in that sense, it  will probably a very -- be a very effective strategy in trying to divert  attention from the story DuJour of the Democratic National Convention.  The  story of the convention, thus far, which is the e-mail scandal and the  resignation of Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p><p>She has come to a bit of a soft landing in the sense.  She has been picked  up by the Clinton campaign to serve as an honorary co-chairman.  But the  damage has been done, and her resignation is something that had to be done,  because -- simply to see her coming out on this stage, you know, walk out  on a daze (ph) in front of all these delegates to face a chorus of boos in  a way that Ted Cruz faced, of course, the boos when is he failed to  introduce Donald Trump and to support Donald Trump at the Republican  convention.

But I am very proud of the campaign that I  ran.  I can't speak to people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were saying, I can't speak to that.  I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  For his part, Bernie Sanders has remained remarkably calm  throughout this scandal.  His convention speech also scheduled to be  delivered tonight.  Will be chock-full of insults directed at Donald Trump,  compliments directed towards Hillary Clinton but he won't be firing away  from within the Democratic tent, perhaps because he is long suspected a  conspiracy to deprive him of the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a great shock to  me.  It's what we talked about six months ago.  I mean, there's no question  to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that  the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton, was in opposition to our campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Those allegiances of Bernie Sanders supporters are not being as  gentle as that thousands gathered on the streets of downtown Philadelphia  yesterday to protest.  It was a larger gathering than anything we saw.</p><p>In Cleveland, albeit, it was a peaceful demonstration.  They'll be moving  up to this neck of the woods today about 20 miles north of where they  protested yesterday to FDR Park.</p><p>The impressive thing about their appearance there yesterday was, they came  out in intense heat and humidity, did not dissuade them did at all.  Today,  a different situation, we had downpours here in Philadelphia.  We'll see if  they've been able -- if they will be able to withstand that.  Maria, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug thanks so much.  Doug McKelway there -- here in  Philly with us.  How will the DNC e-mail leak impact day one and the views  of delegates and voters.</p><p>I want to bring in former advisor to President Bill Clinton and co-author  of the new book, \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat Hillary\" and that is, of  course, Dick Morris.  Dick, good to see you.</p><p>DICK MORRIS, ARMAGEDDON AUTHOR:  Good to be here with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think?  What's the impact of all this?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think that it's notable that Trump went out of his way to  appease the conservatives in his party who he largely defeated by naming  Pence.  And Hillary went out of her way to name Kaine, who is clearly not a  liberal and does nothing to placate Sanders and Warren.</p><p>So when Sanders and Warren addressed the convention tonight, the big thing  we'll notice is that they would not chosen to be vice president.  And in a  sense -- no matter how attractive they are, people are saying that shows  that their views and Hillary's are fundamentally different.  So I think it  really casts a shadow over the whole thing.  But, you know Maria, it can  get worse.  When .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you mean it can -- how is it going to get worse?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, when a bomb hits you, you wonder if the plane is still  overhead.  And on June 14th, there was a leak from anonymous sources in  Russia, probably the Kremlin, that they possessed a number of Hillary's  state department e-mails.  And that they may release them at a time that  might be inconvenient to Hillary, and that's something to keep your eye on  all convention.  Because that would establish that the e-mail server was  hacked and was hacked by our enemies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  That's really interesting, Dagen, because this whole  time she is saying we weren't hacked, everything is fine.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Which in the interview with \"60 Minutes\"  she went out of her way to make that point and put an exclamation on the  discussion about that very e-mail server.</p><p>I want to ask Dick this in terms of a Tim Kaine picked The Wall Street  Journal editorial page, essentially says that Tim Kaine is a pick for when  she wins, so -- and when she begins to govern, that she seems to be so  confident in getting the far left vote, and in getting the votes that -- of  Sanders or Warren would appeal to, that she's basically skipping November  and going right to governing starting in January with Tim Kaine.</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I can't think that she is that na&lt;ve.  I think there's a  different explanation for Tim Kaine.  You're right.  It's confounding as a  political proposition.  But I think that the key is Tim Kaine's letter that  he sent to the banks three days before he was nominated, avowing that he  would opposed stricter regulation of the big banks.</p><p>Now, normally when you're on a short list for V.P. you keep your mouth  shut.  But he overtly sent that letter, and I think it was to get the banks  to lobby Hillary to put him on the ticket.  And I think that what you are  seeing here is Hillary reassuring her financial controllers that she's  still on the reservation by picking Kaine.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PACK NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Dick, good morning.  This  is Morgan.  I'm wondering, what can Bernie Sanders say tonight?  And the  comparison that I'm thinking it was four years ago, Bill Clinton sort of  saved Barack Obama in his reelection by giving that powerful speech at the  convention.  Do you expect Bernie Sanders to pull a Bill Clinton four years  ago or a Ted Cruz last week when it comes to Hillary Clinton tonight?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think it will be a Bernie.  And I think he will use the  opportunity to articulate again his points of view.  I think he'll attract  Trump aggressively.  I think he'll mildly praise Hillary.  But I think that  the real point here is that his voters are the swing the vote in this  election.</p><p>Try to make that point in -- on again, in my book.  The Republicans can run  not just with the right jab, doing the conservative issues but they need to  throw a left hook coming around Hillary and talking to the Sanders voters  in the rear.  And I think Trump did a very good job of that in his speech.   And I think this e-mail scandal and the choice of Kaine both of which  essentially to have lifted the Democratic Party to stop it, really  undermine Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's been trying to do that.  You know, Trump trying to reach  out to those Bernie Sanders voters and Hillary is being forced to defend  the multiple scandals surrounding her and her entire political record.  She  gave that first interview with the V.P. choice Senator Kaine, and Clinton  claimed that she is judged on a different standard than others are judged.   Listen to this Dick Morris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I think that it is fair to say there has been a concerted effort  to convince people like that young man of something.  Nobody is quite sure  what but of something.  I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and  then there's the standard for everybody else.</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, \"60 MINUTES\" HOST:  What's the Hillary standard?</p><p>CLINTON:  Well, it is, you know, a lot of as you saw at the Republican  Convention, unfounded, inaccurate, main spirited attacks with no basis in  truth reality which take on a life of their own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORRIS:  Well .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think?  Is there a Hillary standard?</p><p>MORRIS:  I'm glad his speech writer didn't call it a vast right-wing  conspiracy.  May be they used that one already.  But I think that -- yeah,  when somebody comes out of a bar at night, they had a nice drink.  When the  guy has five DUI (ph), there's a question to whether they shouldn't have  been in that bar in the first place, and that is the Hillary standard.</p><p>But I think that it is -- when we look at this convention, Donald Trump  used this convention to show who Donald Trump is.  He was front and center  of his family, his wife, his kids.  Hillary is going to use this convention  to hide herself.  She is not running.  The first woman is running.  She's  not running, pro-choice is running and pro-gun control.  She's the only  person between Donald Trump and the presidency.</p><p>And in .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great analysis, yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  . in fact she advances through generic rather than through the  specific of her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, that's a great point.  You know, and maybe (ph) she might  also have created that standard for herself by just doing things like, oh,  I am going to -- you have my own e-mail server, because that's what I'm  going to do and nobody else can do that.</p><p>TONY SAYEGH, JAMESTOWN ASSOCIATES:  The most of these in part of that  interview was she said that all these concerns about her honesty  untrustworthiness were baseless.  Meanwhile, we know from the Clinton  Foundation contribution for foreign government, the server and et cetera,  but Delegates County saying, you've known Hillary Clinton for decades.  You  advise the Clintons a long time ago.  Has Hillary changed or is this the  same Hillary you sat down with face to face when you first met the  Clinton's back.  I believe it was in the 80's.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  Real quick, Dick.</p><p>MORRIS:  I think best say to say it, she's metastasized.  In the beginning,  there was the incipient dishonesty, there was the incipient paranoia and  secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  There was the incipient dishonesty corruption but it's grown.   It's metastasized.  It's taken her over.  You know a person from 70 years  old, you knew when they were 30, and you could see them going off the track  but not that much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  But then a 60s and 70s you say, oh, my god, look at what they've  become, that's Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know them really well.  And Dick, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MORRIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, quite morning in terms of futures.  Take a look,  we're really not far from where the market finished the day yesterday, and  yet earnings really driving the story.  Handful of names on the new this  morning.</p><p>SolarCity is (inaudible) higher.  The company reportedly closed to emerge  their deal with Tesla.  Reuters is reporting that the two companies are in  final stages of talks in carrying out due diligence on a potential deal.   Stock as you can see looking higher.</p><p>Well, the initial report of the deal came out last month.  Questions were  raised because Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and the Chairman of SolarCity.   Musk has refused himself from voting on this deal.</p><p>We'll continue to track the latest development following a fatal explosion  in Germany yesterday.   Cheryl Casone with that right now and the other  head lines from our New York headquarters.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yeah, that's right Maria.  The various  interior minister says he believes the incident was likely an Islamist  suicide attack.  Police say a 27-year old Syrian man blew himself up after  he was turned away from an open air music festival in Ansbach.</p><p>Police believe the man who killed himself was motivated after being denied  asylum in Germany.  He was already known to them for a recent drug  misdemeanor.  At least 12 others were injured in the suicide attack.</p><p>We'll here at home.  A wildfire in Southern California, destroying 18 homes  and rapidly gaining straight two days after it broke out.  The fire being  described as a freight train by some setting so much smoke into the air  that planes making water drops on it, had to be grounded (ph) at one point.   Thousands of people forced to evacuate.</p><p>This fire Maria has burned at least 34 square miles but fire officials say  that size may now have doubled.  Of course, it's dark in California.  We'll  see what happens when the sun comes up this morning.</p><p>And finally, the housing market, showing signs of improvement.  (Inaudible)  said that homes are selling an average of a week faster than they did just  one year ago.  This is the supply of nearly 5 percent lower than last year.   Homes are being sold after about 78 days on the market.  The average U.S.  home is currently worth $187,000, Maria, that's a 5.4 percent increase from  June of last year.  That's for prices from 2015.</p><p>But Maria, remember, that we're also looking about 3.5 percent for the 30- year fixed year mortgage right now, that's also affecting sales.  Back to  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Spotlight on technology  this week, setting the stage on market.  Coming up, we're going to preview  the week.  We'll tell you what to expect, out of a whole host (ph) of  earnings within the tech sector.</p><p>Plus, we're coming to you live from Democratic National Convention here in  Philadelphia.  We'll tell about what to expect as the DNC kicks off today.   Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's check market this morning with a lot of  earnings coming out this weekend some economic data that will certainly set  the tone and the Fed.  Two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve is having this  week.</p><p>Ahead of all of that, the market is looking fractionally higher.  It keeps  going back and forth though between positive and negative territory, this  following another record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Investors are gearing up for a slow of Vect (ph) technology earning  including S&amp;P components, Apple which is also a Dow component, reporting  earnings  tomorrow.  Facebook is out on Wednesday.  Amazon is out and Google parent  Alphabet are out with their results on Thursday.</p><p>This is going to be a big week.  You also have a two-day Federal Reserve  meeting which ends on Wednesday.  We're not going to see rates move higher  but we're going to be focused on the language out of the Fed, and what they  say or suggest about the next meeting.</p><p>Recon Capital Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Kelley with us standing by in  our New York studios.  Technology earnings should set the tone, what do you  expect on earnings?  Is the Fed a factor?  What drives market this week,  Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN KELLEY, RECON CAPITAL CIO:  It's going to be a very, very wild week  especially for the Nasdaq 100.  You're going to have about 40 percent of  the companies reporting this week alone.  So that's going to dictate a lot  of the market action.</p><p>And as you alluded to earlier, the big tech names are really going to drive  that but also biotech will be reporting this week as well.  And you're  seeing a lot of these names, are big growers in their space, except for  Apple.  Apple is expected to have 22 to 25 percent revenue decline and  that's because of the refreshed cycle on the iPhone.</p><p>So, we're going to have to see where software and services going that route  but you're seeing all the other names including Facebook, Amazon.  You're  seeing their growth be pretty significant, above 20 percent on the top line  revenue growth and 15 percent on the earnings growth.</p><p>So people are really going to be focused on that, because companies are  going to give their guidance, but it's expected to do very well.  And these  are companies that are giving a good value.  So when you look at the tech  sector alone, it's training in a 20 perfect discount to its forward  earnings on a historical basis.  So, people maybe getting into this and  really actually help make this sector move higher and move the overall  market higher this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even Amazon?  That's the company that's -- not going to cover  up the flow (ph), right Dagen?  That stock is up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Price is up -- maybe price for perfection and the question is,  in terms of the forward-looking earnings are those estimates wrong?  Do  they need to come down because that made -- that could make the stocks not  look like .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not beating (ph) against Amazon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Apple is down 6 percent this year.  It really  fell off a cliff.  It's come back a little bit but in terms of potential  upside there, I've heard people talking about that.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yeah .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With Amazon -- yeah.</p><p>KELLEY:  It's really limited upside on Apple but -- just so you know on the  Amazon front, Amazon is a great company that hasn't really focused on  earnings.  They've really focused on revenue growth.  So when people start  talking about a fundamental basis and their earnings, you can't focus on  that, because what they could do is they could actually slash all of their  expenditures and really make it into a great value stock if they wanted to  but they're not focused on that.  That's why you're seeing in perform  quarter over quarter on a basis.  That's why you're seeing lead even in the  Cloud space.</p><p>So, their Amazon is going to be a company that ends up being a Cloud  company that happens to have an eCommerce platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  You know what?  Investors have not been bothered by that  that they focus on revenue growth.  They keep buying the stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They can hold their nose only so long and then they have to  breath through their nose and look out block (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  Kevin, any other highlights from your standpoint?   Do you care about the Fed, Tuesday, Wednesday?</p><p>KELLEY:  I don't think the Fed is really muted right now especially because  people are not expecting a move, and if they are expecting a move they're  looking it to be in December or early next year.  So people -- investors  aren't really focused on that, and they're not even focused on the bank of  Japan either because of the move last month.</p><p>So, people were going to be focused on the market.  Yup, exactly.  All  about earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I think (ph) the Japan, is on Friday.  All right, Kevin,  thank you.</p><p>We are awaiting big news this morning form month all about earnings from  Verizon reports out that say it is going to be completing inking a $5  billion deal to acquire Yahoo.  What it means for CEO Marissa Mayer and  shareholders of Yahoo and Verizon.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  You are watching a special edition of Mornings  with Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning everybody, welcome back.  I am Maria  Bartiromo.

It is Monday,   July 25th. We are coming to you live from the Democratic National  Convention in Philadelphia. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 6 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drama at the Democratic National Convention. And it hasn't even started  yet. Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning after an e-mail  that shows the DNC favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders in the  primary. Clinton says she was unaware, but Sanders pushed back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I can't speak to let  people who were not working for me, who were saying whatever they were  saying, I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my campaign.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a  great shock to me. I think as I said, it's what we talked about six months  ago. I mean, there's no question in my mind and I think no question to any  objective observer's mind that the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This raising new questions this morning about party unity.  Sanders had to address the convention tonight and his supporters already  filling the streets, protesting all day yesterday and today expected. </p><p>Breaking news meanwhile. Another nightclub shooting in Florida. At least  two people have been killed, 17 others injured. Authorities searching for  the suspect. We have the latest details ahead. </p><p>A dangerous heat wave whipping half of the country. A look at when  temperatures will begin to drop, coming up. And in Southern California, a  massive wildfire growing rapidly. More than 1,000 residents evacuated as  firefighters battle that blaze.</p><p>Yahoo reportedly finally with a buyer. Verizon is the buyer expected to  announce it is acquiring the struggling technology company today for nearly  $5 billion. Yahoo will not be the only tech company making headlines this  week. Giants including Apple, Facebook, Google parent company Alphabet all  set to report their quarterly results. </p><p>We will have a preview. New signs that the housing market is coming back. A  new survey says homes are flying off the market, so fire is better act  fast. We'll bring all the latest news there. </p><p>And markets this morning edging higher. take a look at futures really flat  on the session indicating a fractional move to the upside for the Doe Jones  Industrial average. </p><p>Later this week, investors have a lot to digest between economic data and  earnings news which continues to flow out this week. </p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher across the board. Take a look at the  performances. We see the FJ, CAC 40, and DAX index, the German DAX index up  almost 1 percent. </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning. And here with me to break it  all down, Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, Maverick PAC national co- chair, Morgan Ortagus, and republican strategist, Tony Sayegh. </p><p>Good to see you, everybody. </p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shall we kick it off, we get here and the first thing is  distraction. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that how do democrats say unity? That's how you say unity  for democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God. But we've got that coming up. </p><p>To join us this morning we've got a great line up. Former adviser to  President Bill Clinton and author of \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat  Hillary,\" Dick Morris is with us this morning. </p><p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will join us. Congressman Caroline  Maloney will be here. Former astronaut, husband of former Representative  Gabriel Gifford, and co-founder of American for Responsible Solutions, Mark  Kelly is joining us this morning. And former Michigan Governor and senior  of Correct the Record, a super PAC67 backing Hillary Clinton, Jennifer  Granholm will be with us as well. </p><p>Disorder at the DNC this morning. A major shakeup rocking the Democratic  Party emitted in the e-mail scandal just hours before the Democratic  national Convention kicks in Philadelphia. </p><p>Let's get right to Blake Burman, he's here in Philly with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Maria. God morning to you  as well. Debbie Wasserman Schulz will gather in the Democratic National  Conventional later today. She'll give a speech at some point this week.  Gavel it out on Thursday and that will be it. </p><p>For her is that the Democratic National Committee as Wasserman Schultz  yesterday resigned from the top post at the DNC. Of course, this is due to  the fallout of the WikiLeaks scandal. WikiLeaks over the weekend releasing  some 19,000 plus e-mails that showed during the primary process. </p><p>Top democratic officials, some of them favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie  Sanders even in some states trying to tip the scales towards Clinton.  Wasserman Schultz herself even had some choice words when describing  Sanders campaign manager. </p><p>Now, Hillary Clinton was asked about those e-mails over the weekend, in an  interview with 60 Minutes. I should note that she gave this interview  before Wasserman Schultz officially submitted her letter of resignation.  Hear now Hillary Clinton about the e-mails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  I didn't know anything about it and I haven't read any of those.  But I am adamantly opposed to anyone bringing religion into our political  process. </p><p>Again, I don't know anything. I don't know anything about -- about these e- mails. I haven't followed it. But I'm very proud of the campaign that I  ran. </p><p>I can't speak to what people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were singing. I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Donald Trump as you might was not staying silent during all of  this. He had several responses via Twitter. Among them I'll read you one  here, quote \"Because the democrats are in a total meltdown, but the biased  media will say how great they are doing. E-mail say the rigged system is  alive and well.\" </p><p>Of course, Maria, Trump has been saying that the system was rigged against  Bernie Sanders. He will try to use this to try to sway some Sanders to his  side, and in something that you can't make up, Maria. The theme here  tonight for the democrats, \"United together.\" Ted Cruz and all of that was  so last week. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true. I mean, so much conversation about last week,  and yet here we are kicking this often and this happens. Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman with the latest there. </p><p>I want to bring in former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a former  presidential candidate himself and Fox News contributor. Congressman, good  to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your reaction to the e-mail scandal, WikiLeaks releasing  20,000 e-mails and that's obviously it came to life. </p><p>KUCINICH:  What reflects the culture inside the Democratic National  Committee. And as such, I think that when you add up all of the things,  setting the debate schedule that was insufficient, that super delegates.  There's so many things which basically prove that this election was rigged  against Bernie Sanders. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think, now -- we were talking on the commercial break. You  think Bernie Sanders should do more. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I actually think that it's time for him to consider  withdrawing the endorsement. Because it's not just about him, it's about  the movement that he represents which had 46 percent of the votes for the  country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And it was that kind of conduct was totally dismissive of almost  half of the democratic voters. And you cannot have that kind of contempt  for voters. And I think Bernie, I would -- I think he ought to at least  consider withdrawing the endorsement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we've been talking and hearing from the Democratic  National Committee yesterday as this is happening, Tony Sayegh. They kept  saying, well, he wasn't going to win anyway. But the truth is we'll never  know that for sure. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Well, doesn't that confirm the whole idea that it was rigged in  the first place.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to make that -- to make that...</p><p>SAYEGH:  And the evolution is crazy, Maria. You and I were together  yesterday morning. At that point, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has just said  she's not going to speak at the convention. </p><p>By the end of the day, and Bernie Sanders interview had I think a lot to do  it. She was out as the head of the DNC. But, Congressman, I agree with you.  I think Bernie Sanders should be strong and may be reconsidering his  endorsement. It doesn't sound like he's going to do that though. But it  sounds like his followers are pretty darn mad. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, they are. And, you know, as a former candidate for  president, I can tell you that, you know, you cannot expect the people who  support you to just go lockstep when then you say. And so that, you know,  there's the Bernie movement is a little bit separate from what the  candidate might want to do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUCINICH:  And I want to go back to what you just said, Maria, where the  DNC's excuse was he wasn't going to win anyways. In other words, their  conduct, actually help to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where Bernie  was locked up because the game was rigged. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. And remember when we were watching all of those  democrats, we were all scratching our heads saying, why are they doing it  when the playoffs are on. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are they doing it on a Saturday night when no one watches - - or Sunday night. I mean, they were all very low, you know, viewing night  when they did these debates.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  But, Congressman, don't  you think this is immedicable larger cultural problem within the DNC  within, you know, when Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, this  the second e-mail scandal in the past year with the Democratic Party. </p><p>But don't you think that the party itself needs to look and say, you know,  we have a cultural leadership problem here where we're allowing this  cronyism to go on and fair tactics to go on that if the Republican Party  did, we'd be skewered for doing this. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, that is true. But let's go one step further. This is a  whole new era where technology is impacting politics in a powerful way. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  This is the millennial will understand this better than anyone.  Because you don't put anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't expect to  have to read publicly. And so, the politicians are just getting caught up. </p><p>And I think caught up and I think that what it reflects is an older  political culture that a pre-internet and it hasn't really caught up.</p><p>And so, again, but there has to be some kind of and say this is not right.  This kind of politics cannot be -- cannot be -- cannot continue. </p><p>SAYEGH:  Congressman, I suspect that this has disturbed you as much as it  disturb me and others. The idea that it was revealed they were  contemplating using Bernie Sanders religious beliefs...</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes. </p><p>SAYEGH:  ... as a campaign issue. And at the time where particularly as  republicans were often demonized by our opponents for being racist, being  bigoted in some fashion. Certainly our presidential candidate today is  assail by those things. </p><p>Doesn't that reveal hypocrisy that they were actually willing to do it  against their own? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, I think it goes a little bit worse than hypocrisy. Here's  why. The head of the DNC, Jewish, OK. And probably so. An that's a good  thing. But how can you have under lengths trying to trap somebody, you  know, about his religion which also happens to be Jewish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  I mean, it boggles the mind. And so, this is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The cultural problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of -- the e-mails was -- one of the officials basically  saying somebody needs to ask him, do you even believe in God. And then he  said, look, my peeps in West Virginia are going to -- that will really  resonate with them, you know. Maybe he is an Atheist. Now he's Jewish. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, you know, the question now is that the DNC believe in  fairness? Does the DNC believe in the Constitution of the United States and  Freedom of Religion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUCINICH:  Does the DNC believe in trying to unite the party? </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I wouldn't be surprise to see two campaigns to have sort of e- mails going back and forth. But I think the crucial difference here is not  that these are two campaigns. This is the Democratic National Committee  overtly planning how to take one of their candidates. </p><p>KUCINICH:  There's no way to defend us. It's indefensible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tonight, Bernie Sanders will speak. Tonight, we'll see what  he says. We'll see if he addresses this. That's' going to be something to  watch.</p><p>KUCINICH:  he's going to need to address.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And Michelle Obama, the First Lady will speak tonight. So,  we will be obviously covering that. Congressman, good to see you. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. Congressman Kucinich there.  We will be live from the Democratic National Convention tonight in  Philadelphia all week. Don't miss our special primetime coverage, I'll here  that off tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern, followed by Lou Dobbs and Trish Regan.  So, do join us for our special coverage tonight. </p><p>Meanwhile, we are following the breaking news out of a nightclub shooting  in Fort Myers, Florida. At last two people are dead, 17 injured. We will  bring you the very latest from this deadly shooting in Florida. </p><p>Yahoo, meanwhile may have finally found a new home in Verizon. Reports say  Verizon is set to announce the nearly $5 billion deal this morning.  Interesting to know that back in the day Microsoft was willing to pay $48  billion. Verizon will pay 5 billion. Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. A fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub early  this morning to report. Cheryl Casone with the story and the other  headlines right now in our New York headquarters. Cheryl, good morning to  you. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria. Well,  officials say that at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others  injured in a shooting outside of a Florida nightclub. This happened just  after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.</p><p>Gunshots ring out in the parking lot and at this hour there are two active  crime scenes that we know off. Authorities say that injuries range from  minor to life-threatening at this hour. </p><p>Three people have been taken into custody and the investigation is  continuing right now. We'll bring updates if we get them, Maris.</p><p>Also this today, a deadly heat wave continuing to blanket parts of the  United States. Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona who died  from the heat as near triple digit temperatures sports state from New York  all the way to California. </p><p>Cody's mom was hiking in the snowy mountains when he suffered a fatal heat  strike. This happened in Phoenix, Arizona. Across the country, Maria,  temperatures got in 100 today, in particular in New York, Philadelphia, and  Washington. The heat index could be much higher if you combine the  temperature and humidity. </p><p>And finally, in business headlines this morning, the long process is over.  It appears that Verizon has come out on top in the biddings for Yahoo.  Reports said that Verizon has agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo. That  report includes Yahoo's core internet business and its finance news and  sports sides along with some real estate from the company. </p><p>Maria, the deal expected to be announced today. Take a look at buzz stock,  Yahoo right now, Maria. The stock is flat, the pre-market, but Verizon is  up just lately. Back to you in Philadelphia. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to bring in the  CIO of Recon Capital, chief investment officer, Kevin Kelly. Kevin, good to  see you. What are your thoughts on this deal? I think it's just so  extraordinary that back in, you know, back in the, what was it, early 2000,  Microsoft made a bid of -- a bid of $48 billion for Yahoo. And here we are  looking at a deal $4.8 billion or 5 billion. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS CEO:  Yes. You're bringing up a great  point. I mean, Marissa Mayer as well as other regimes have actually  decrease shareholder value pretty significantly for Yahoo. But what's nice  to know is that this is finally over. </p><p>Shareholders actually wanted Verizon to complete this deal. You can see  with the stock they really weren't attributing any value to this core  Yahoo. Yahoo right now when you look at the share price, it's really  factoring in Alibaba in its share price. </p><p>So, this is great news for shareholders because they now they can move on  with it. But, I mean, Marissa Mayer said she would not mess up. The Tumbler  rock was a shame. She said the sales process would go smoothly. It was  anything but people didn't know what was her sale. You could but this, or  you could buy that, including the real estate the patents they didn't know.</p><p>So, this is a good deal, especially for Verizon. So, they thought Yahoo was  going to hold them up on the sales process and actually ask for more, but  this is a fair price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin, let me ask you. The other technology earnings really  going to be in headlines this week. That Apple coming out with earnings.  You've got Google parent Alphabet coming out. And I believe Amazon, is that  going to set the tone. What are you expecting from some of these high- profile tech names this week? </p><p>KELLY:  That will set the tone this week, especially when you actually have  over a dozen central banks making actions including the Federal Reserve  here. People are going to focus on the largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 and  that is tech. </p><p>So, people are going to start seeing how these managements are going to  guide going forward. When you look at the tech sector, it provides the  largest growth out of any sector as well. It has net cash on the balance  sheets so people are going to start going into these names if you start to  see dividends increase in the tech sector, which could be great for the  market this week. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. It's all about -- it's all about earnings and it's  about guidance, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes. And I wanted to just point out Marissa Mayer, she gets  terminated with this acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon. She gets $50 million.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's already earned 100 million in cash and other compensation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, it's a sweet payday for basically driving the company into  the ground. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fifty million.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Kevin.</p><p>Coming up, democratic party leaders facing outrage ahead of the convention  over leaked e-mails. And the Clinton campaign is pointing the fingers at  Russia. Russian hackers, that's next.</p><p>And then if you're in the market to buy a home, maybe it's fair to act  fast. Homes are selling faster than a year earlier. What you should do to  win the housing wars, straight ahead.</p><p>Back in a moment on Mornings with Maria, live from Philadelphia at the  Democratic National Convention.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. </p><p>Hillary Clinton reacting to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S.  diplomatic compound in Benghazi. That ahead of today's kickoff to the  Democratic national Convention. </p><p>Here's what she said in an interview to 60 Minutes last night when asked  about her responsibility there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  So, when this happened in Benghazi, I immediately stood up an  independent committee, distinguished Americans from the military civilian  experts. They came out and they said, you know, the ball was dropped in  security. And, you know, some of the decisions that were made probably  should have been rethought. </p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT:  But wasn't that your ball to  carry? </p><p>CLINTON:  No, it wasn't. It was not my fault to carry. It was there with --  read the -- read the reports. Read all of the reports all many hundreds of  pages of them including this latest one, which was a political exercise  from the very beginning. Those never reached me. Those never came to my  attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, Pete  Hegseth. He's also a Fox news contributor. Pete, your reaction to that.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, IRAQ &amp; AFGHANISTAN VETERAN:  Good morning. The reaction is  she continues to be sort of arrogantly dismissive of the entire team.  She'll say immediately, yes, I had some responsibility but no  responsibility. It never reached my level. </p><p>And I wish Scott Pelley had asked the real question about, well then why  did you lie to people, that to me the biggest scandal. </p><p>For a week afterwards you lied about what you knew to be the real reason  for the attack. But there was a political expedient narrative that you push  forward. He never asked that follow up question. I think she needs to  continue to be asked that question. Because she has no answer. </p><p>The evident shows she told her daughter one thing and then lied to the  families of the fallen and said something else. She has never taken  responsibility for this and never taken it seriously. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. I mean, you would think -- I mean, this was September 11,  2012. And they had this whole narrative that there was a video, and then  they sent Susan Rice out there on all the Sunday shows. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to his point, the most disgusting thing about it which she  still won't own is that the she told the family...</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... that very lie that was cooked up by the administration for  political purposes. And then when she talks about in the interview, it was  not my ball to carry in terms of the security... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's fault was it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... in the program. Right. You're running -- again.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's the Secretary of State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was the Secretary of State, how did you operate. how did you  behave in that leadership post and you expect the American people to vote  you to run the nation. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And then, you know, in any leader and organization when something  goes wrong the buck should stop with the leader. And this is what I was  talking to earlier about my point of this culture within her campaign in  the DNC. </p><p>That I think the story would have been a lot sooner if she would have just  said I was the Secretary of State, ultimately it's my responsibility. But  the fact that she still can't take any responsibility as why this narrative  keeps going and going and going. And I don't know why she doesn't get it.  You're in charge, take responsibility. </p><p>HEGSETH:  That's exactly right. Leaders assert themselves in times of  difficulty not fade to the background which is exactly what she did hiding  behind other people. There's a scandal before this current scandal during  Benghazi and the scandal afterwards is what we still need to pin her down  on because she's never been able to explain why she lied. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And no one will forget the famous quote at this point when she  was testifying to Congress what difference does it make at this point. </p><p>Let me move on to this WikiLeaks dump of 20,000 e-mails. Hillary Clinton's  campaign is pointing fingers at Russian hackers for the DNC e-mail scandal  ahead of the convention. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is disturbing to us is that we, experts are  telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these e- mails. And other experts are now saying that they are -- the Russian are  releasing these e-mails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump. </p><p>I don't think it's coincidental that these e-mails were released on the eve  of our convention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know. To help Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They have theories that Donald Trump is pro-Putin and as a result  Putin state actors are working to poured out e-mails to the DNC. Again,  they're trying to obfuscate confuse create a counter narrative for the  irresponsibility and their inability to secure...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's still on tough election right now. Putin is in re-election  at the moment which is quite tough, you know, in Russia? So, I think he has  his own affairs to worry about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She still insists which she went of her way to point out in the  60 Minutes interview that her e-mail server, that her e-mails weren't  compromise. Well, we'll wait and see if that's the case because if the  server was hacked you know those e-mails are going to show up.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, but this whole leak is so really dangerous for the  DNC because the truth is now everything they say, I don't know, people are  questioning. Because it's like, well, you just created a narrative yourself  that Bernie Sanders might not be Jewish and then he's an Atheist. </p><p>So, now I'm going to believe this new narrative that you've just come up  with that Donald Trump is behind somehow this DNC leaked? I mean, it's hard  to believe anything now. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Indeed. And from the media as well as you see collusion with the  media on the stories they're running in by Politico and elsewhere. Hey,  does this make sense. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Vogel for Politico actually showed them his story before he  published. </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes. But, doesn't it fit the narrative that Donald Trump is that  they're lying to you? That it's all of a fussed; this is exactly what this  does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I feel I love the fact that one woman in the Democratic Party  lost her job over an e-mail scandal and another one gets nominated to run  for president. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. All right. We will -- well, there you go. Pete and Dagen,  great insights. Pete Hegseth there.</p><p>A rocky start to the Democratic National Convention for sure as protesters  take to the streets before the official kick off. </p><p>More on what to expect live on the ground from Philly. And then wildfires  sweeping California this morning sparking massive evacuations. More with  the measures the state is talking to cope.</p><p>We're back in a moment. We're live from the Democratic National Convention  here in Philadelphia. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Once again, here is Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN:  Good Monday morning everybody, welcome back.  I am  Maria Bartiromo.  It is Monday, July 25th.  Your top stories right now,  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Democrats in disarray DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz losses her job  after leaked e-mails show that the committee worked behind scenes against  Bernie Sanders.  Wasserman Schultz's counterpart, Reince Priebus, wade in  on controversies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  Today's events  show I think really want an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week  in unifying their party and starting out the week by losing your party  chairman over longstanding bitterness between fractions is no way to keep  something together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The conflict raising new questions about party unity to insure  Sander set to address the convention tonight, and protesters and Sanders  supporters are already filling the streets here in Philly.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Southern California, a massive wildfire grows rapidly.  More  than 1,000 residents evacuated, as firefighter's battle that blaze.</p><p>Technology in focus this week in business, Giants including Apple, Facebook  and Google parent Alphabet all set to report their quarterly results.   We've got the preview for you on tech.</p><p>New Science, the housing market is coming back.  A new survey says homes  are flying off the market so buyers better act fast.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets this morning -- really flat in on the session.  As you  can see, things have turned negative, but just by a fraction.  So Dow  Industrials now indicated lower by about two points.</p><p>Later this week, investors will have a lot to digest between a host of  economic data like the GDP report is out at the end of the week, and a  number of high profile earnings news coming out.</p><p>In Europe, this morning stocks are higher across the board, take a look.   Well, not across the board.  The FT 100 is actually down at 10 points, but  things have improved in the Eurozone, Cac Quarante in Paris up half a  percent, Dax index in Germany up almost 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia, overnight mixed performances, as you can see here, also just  fractional moves as well.</p><p>The city of Philadelphia prepping for expected protests today, as the  Democratic National Convention kicks off.  Key speakers tonight include  first lady, Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Fox News's Doug McKelway is live in Philly with a preview.  Doug, good  morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Morning Maria, and there's been a bit of breaking  news from the Democratic National Convention this morning.  They have  announced that the keynote speaker for tonight will be Massachusetts  Senator Elizabeth Warren.  This is probably a very, very sound decision by  the DNC.</p><p>As you know, Elizabeth Warren has been an attacked dog nipping at heels of  Donald Trump.  Throughout this campaign she goes head-to-head with him in  Twitter wars, and matches insult for insult.  And so, in that sense, it  will probably a very -- be a very effective strategy in trying to divert  attention from the story DuJour of the Democratic National Convention.  The  story of the convention, thus far, which is the e-mail scandal and the  resignation of Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p><p>She has come to a bit of a soft landing in the sense.  She has been picked  up by the Clinton campaign to serve as an honorary co-chairman.  But the  damage has been done, and her resignation is something that had to be done,  because -- simply to see her coming out on this stage, you know, walk out  on a daze (ph) in front of all these delegates to face a chorus of boos in  a way that Ted Cruz faced, of course, the boos when is he failed to  introduce Donald Trump and to support Donald Trump at the Republican  convention.  Something they did not want to see repeated here.</p><p>Clinton has been successful in alienating herself from the scandal as well  as she told \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE:  I don't know anything about these e- mails, I haven't followed it.  But I am very proud of the campaign that I  ran.  I can't speak to people who were not working for me, who were saying  whatever they were saying, I can't speak to that.  I can only speak to my  campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  For his part, Bernie Sanders has remained remarkably calm  throughout this scandal.  His convention speech also scheduled to be  delivered tonight.  Will be chock-full of insults directed at Donald Trump,  compliments directed towards Hillary Clinton but he won't be firing away  from within the Democratic tent, perhaps because he is long suspected a  conspiracy to deprive him of the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS:  I think it's outrageous, but it is not a great shock to  me.  It's what we talked about six months ago.  I mean, there's no question  to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that  the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton, was in opposition to our campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Those allegiances of Bernie Sanders supporters are not being as  gentle as that thousands gathered on the streets of downtown Philadelphia  yesterday to protest.  It was a larger gathering than anything we saw.</p><p>In Cleveland, albeit, it was a peaceful demonstration.  They'll be moving  up to this neck of the woods today about 20 miles north of where they  protested yesterday to FDR Park.</p><p>The impressive thing about their appearance there yesterday was, they came  out in intense heat and humidity, did not dissuade them did at all.  Today,  a different situation, we had downpours here in Philadelphia.  We'll see if  they've been able -- if they will be able to withstand that.  Maria, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug thanks so much.  Doug McKelway there -- here in  Philly with us.  How will the DNC e-mail leak impact day one and the views  of delegates and voters.</p><p>I want to bring in former advisor to President Bill Clinton and co-author  of the new book, \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat Hillary\" and that is, of  course, Dick Morris.  Dick, good to see you.</p><p>DICK MORRIS, ARMAGEDDON AUTHOR:  Good to be here with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think?  What's the impact of all this?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think that it's notable that Trump went out of his way to  appease the conservatives in his party who he largely defeated by naming  Pence.  And Hillary went out of her way to name Kaine, who is clearly not a  liberal and does nothing to placate Sanders and Warren.</p><p>So when Sanders and Warren addressed the convention tonight, the big thing  we'll notice is that they would not chosen to be vice president.  And in a  sense -- no matter how attractive they are, people are saying that shows  that their views and Hillary's are fundamentally different.  So I think it  really casts a shadow over the whole thing.  But, you know Maria, it can  get worse.  When .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you mean it can -- how is it going to get worse?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, when a bomb hits you, you wonder if the plane is still  overhead.  And on June 14th, there was a leak from anonymous sources in  Russia, probably the Kremlin, that they possessed a number of Hillary's  state department e-mails.  And that they may release them at a time that  might be inconvenient to Hillary, and that's something to keep your eye on  all convention.  Because that would establish that the e-mail server was  hacked and was hacked by our enemies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  That's really interesting, Dagen, because this whole  time she is saying we weren't hacked, everything is fine.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Which in the interview with \"60 Minutes\"  she went out of her way to make that point and put an exclamation on the  discussion about that very e-mail server.</p><p>I want to ask Dick this in terms of a Tim Kaine picked The Wall Street  Journal editorial page, essentially says that Tim Kaine is a pick for when  she wins, so -- and when she begins to govern, that she seems to be so  confident in getting the far left vote, and in getting the votes that -- of  Sanders or Warren would appeal to, that she's basically skipping November  and going right to governing starting in January with Tim Kaine.</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I can't think that she is that na&lt;ve.  I think there's a  different explanation for Tim Kaine.  You're right.  It's confounding as a  political proposition.  But I think that the key is Tim Kaine's letter that  he sent to the banks three days before he was nominated, avowing that he  would opposed stricter regulation of the big banks.</p><p>Now, normally when you're on a short list for V.P. you keep your mouth  shut.  But he overtly sent that letter, and I think it was to get the banks  to lobby Hillary to put him on the ticket.  And I think that what you are  seeing here is Hillary reassuring her financial controllers that she's  still on the reservation by picking Kaine.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PACK NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Dick, good morning.  This  is Morgan.  I'm wondering, what can Bernie Sanders say tonight?  And the  comparison that I'm thinking it was four years ago, Bill Clinton sort of  saved Barack Obama in his reelection by giving that powerful speech at the  convention.  Do you expect Bernie Sanders to pull a Bill Clinton four years  ago or a Ted Cruz last week when it comes to Hillary Clinton tonight?</p><p>MORRIS:  Well, I think it will be a Bernie.  And I think he will use the  opportunity to articulate again his points of view.  I think he'll attract  Trump aggressively.  I think he'll mildly praise Hillary.  But I think that  the real point here is that his voters are the swing the vote in this  election.</p><p>Try to make that point in -- on again, in my book.  The Republicans can run  not just with the right jab, doing the conservative issues but they need to  throw a left hook coming around Hillary and talking to the Sanders voters  in the rear.  And I think Trump did a very good job of that in his speech.   And I think this e-mail scandal and the choice of Kaine both of which  essentially to have lifted the Democratic Party to stop it, really  undermine Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's been trying to do that.  You know, Trump trying to reach  out to those Bernie Sanders voters and Hillary is being forced to defend  the multiple scandals surrounding her and her entire political record.  She  gave that first interview with the V.P. choice Senator Kaine, and Clinton  claimed that she is judged on a different standard than others are judged.   Listen to this Dick Morris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I think that it is fair to say there has been a concerted effort  to convince people like that young man of something.  Nobody is quite sure  what but of something.  I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and  then there's the standard for everybody else.</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, \"60 MINUTES\" HOST:  What's the Hillary standard?</p><p>CLINTON:  Well, it is, you know, a lot of as you saw at the Republican  Convention, unfounded, inaccurate, main spirited attacks with no basis in  truth reality which take on a life of their own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORRIS:  Well .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think?  Is there a Hillary standard?</p><p>MORRIS:  I'm glad his speech writer didn't call it a vast right-wing  conspiracy.  May be they used that one already.  But I think that -- yeah,  when somebody comes out of a bar at night, they had a nice drink.  When the  guy has five DUI (ph), there's a question to whether they shouldn't have  been in that bar in the first place, and that is the Hillary standard.</p><p>But I think that it is -- when we look at this convention, Donald Trump  used this convention to show who Donald Trump is.  He was front and center  of his family, his wife, his kids.  Hillary is going to use this convention  to hide herself.  She is not running.  The first woman is running.  She's  not running, pro-choice is running and pro-gun control.  She's the only  person between Donald Trump and the presidency.</p><p>And in .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great analysis, yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  . in fact she advances through generic rather than through the  specific of her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, that's a great point.  You know, and maybe (ph) she might  also have created that standard for herself by just doing things like, oh,  I am going to -- you have my own e-mail server, because that's what I'm  going to do and nobody else can do that.</p><p>TONY SAYEGH, JAMESTOWN ASSOCIATES:  The most of these in part of that  interview was she said that all these concerns about her honesty  untrustworthiness were baseless.  Meanwhile, we know from the Clinton  Foundation contribution for foreign government, the server and et cetera,  but Delegates County saying, you've known Hillary Clinton for decades.  You  advise the Clintons a long time ago.  Has Hillary changed or is this the  same Hillary you sat down with face to face when you first met the  Clinton's back.  I believe it was in the 80's.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  Real quick, Dick.</p><p>MORRIS:  I think best say to say it, she's metastasized.  In the beginning,  there was the incipient dishonesty, there was the incipient paranoia and  secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  There was the incipient dishonesty corruption but it's grown.   It's metastasized.  It's taken her over.  You know a person from 70 years  old, you knew when they were 30, and you could see them going off the track  but not that much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS:  But then a 60s and 70s you say, oh, my god, look at what they've  become, that's Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know them really well.  And Dick, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MORRIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, quite morning in terms of futures.  Take a look,  we're really not far from where the market finished the day yesterday, and  yet earnings really driving the story.  Handful of names on the new this  morning.</p><p>SolarCity is (inaudible) higher.  The company reportedly closed to emerge  their deal with Tesla.  Reuters is reporting that the two companies are in  final stages of talks in carrying out due diligence on a potential deal.   Stock as you can see looking higher.</p><p>Well, the initial report of the deal came out last month.  Questions were  raised because Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and the Chairman of SolarCity.   Musk has refused himself from voting on this deal.</p><p>We'll continue to track the latest development following a fatal explosion  in Germany yesterday.   Cheryl Casone with that right now and the other  head lines from our New York headquarters.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yeah, that's right Maria.  The various  interior minister says he believes the incident was likely an Islamist  suicide attack.  Police say a 27-year old Syrian man blew himself up after  he was turned away from an open air music festival in Ansbach.</p><p>Police believe the man who killed himself was motivated after being denied  asylum in Germany.  He was already known to them for a recent drug  misdemeanor.  At least 12 others were injured in the suicide attack.</p><p>We'll here at home.  A wildfire in Southern California, destroying 18 homes  and rapidly gaining straight two days after it broke out.  The fire being  described as a freight train by some setting so much smoke into the air  that planes making water drops on it, had to be grounded (ph) at one point.   Thousands of people forced to evacuate.</p><p>This fire Maria has burned at least 34 square miles but fire officials say  that size may now have doubled.  Of course, it's dark in California.  We'll  see what happens when the sun comes up this morning.</p><p>And finally, the housing market, showing signs of improvement.  (Inaudible)  said that homes are selling an average of a week faster than they did just  one year ago.  This is the supply of nearly 5 percent lower than last year.   Homes are being sold after about 78 days on the market.  The average U.S.  home is currently worth $187,000, Maria, that's a 5.4 percent increase from  June of last year.  That's for prices from 2015.</p><p>But Maria, remember, that we're also looking about 3.5 percent for the 30- year fixed year mortgage right now, that's also affecting sales.  Back to  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Spotlight on technology  this week, setting the stage on market.  Coming up, we're going to preview  the week.  We'll tell you what to expect, out of a whole host (ph) of  earnings within the tech sector.</p><p>Plus, we're coming to you live from Democratic National Convention here in  Philadelphia.  We'll tell about what to expect as the DNC kicks off today.   Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's check market this morning with a lot of  earnings coming out this weekend some economic data that will certainly set  the tone and the Fed.  Two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve is having this  week.</p><p>Ahead of all of that, the market is looking fractionally higher.  It keeps  going back and forth though between positive and negative territory, this  following another record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Investors are gearing up for a slow of Vect (ph) technology earning  including S&amp;P components, Apple which is also a Dow component, reporting  earnings  tomorrow.  Facebook is out on Wednesday.  Amazon is out and Google parent  Alphabet are out with their results on Thursday.</p><p>This is going to be a big week.  You also have a two-day Federal Reserve  meeting which ends on Wednesday.  We're not going to see rates move higher  but we're going to be focused on the language out of the Fed, and what they  say or suggest about the next meeting.</p><p>Recon Capital Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Kelley with us standing by in  our New York studios.  Technology earnings should set the tone, what do you  expect on earnings?  Is the Fed a factor?  What drives market this week,  Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN KELLEY, RECON CAPITAL CIO:  It's going to be a very, very wild week  especially for the Nasdaq 100.  You're going to have about 40 percent of  the companies reporting this week alone.  So that's going to dictate a lot  of the market action.</p><p>And as you alluded to earlier, the big tech names are really going to drive  that but also biotech will be reporting this week as well.  And you're  seeing a lot of these names, are big growers in their space, except for  Apple.  Apple is expected to have 22 to 25 percent revenue decline and  that's because of the refreshed cycle on the iPhone.</p><p>So, we're going to have to see where software and services going that route  but you're seeing all the other names including Facebook, Amazon.  You're  seeing their growth be pretty significant, above 20 percent on the top line  revenue growth and 15 percent on the earnings growth.</p><p>So people are really going to be focused on that, because companies are  going to give their guidance, but it's expected to do very well.  And these  are companies that are giving a good value.  So when you look at the tech  sector alone, it's training in a 20 perfect discount to its forward  earnings on a historical basis.  So, people maybe getting into this and  really actually help make this sector move higher and move the overall  market higher this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even Amazon?  That's the company that's -- not going to cover  up the flow (ph), right Dagen?  That stock is up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Price is up -- maybe price for perfection and the question is,  in terms of the forward-looking earnings are those estimates wrong?  Do  they need to come down because that made -- that could make the stocks not  look like .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not beating (ph) against Amazon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Apple is down 6 percent this year.  It really  fell off a cliff.  It's come back a little bit but in terms of potential  upside there, I've heard people talking about that.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yeah .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With Amazon -- yeah.</p><p>KELLEY:  It's really limited upside on Apple but -- just so you know on the  Amazon front, Amazon is a great company that hasn't really focused on  earnings.  They've really focused on revenue growth.  So when people start  talking about a fundamental basis and their earnings, you can't focus on  that, because what they could do is they could actually slash all of their  expenditures and really make it into a great value stock if they wanted to  but they're not focused on that.  That's why you're seeing in perform  quarter over quarter on a basis.  That's why you're seeing lead even in the  Cloud space.</p><p>So, their Amazon is going to be a company that ends up being a Cloud  company that happens to have an eCommerce platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  You know what?  Investors have not been bothered by that  that they focus on revenue growth.  They keep buying the stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They can hold their nose only so long and then they have to  breath through their nose and look out block (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  Kevin, any other highlights from your standpoint?   Do you care about the Fed, Tuesday, Wednesday?</p><p>KELLEY:  I don't think the Fed is really muted right now especially because  people are not expecting a move, and if they are expecting a move they're  looking it to be in December or early next year.  So people -- investors  aren't really focused on that, and they're not even focused on the bank of  Japan either because of the move last month.</p><p>So, people were going to be focused on the market.  Yup, exactly.  All  about earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I think (ph) the Japan, is on Friday.  All right, Kevin,  thank you.</p><p>We are awaiting big news this morning form month all about earnings from  Verizon reports out that say it is going to be completing inking a $5  billion deal to acquire Yahoo.  What it means for CEO Marissa Mayer and  shareholders of Yahoo and Verizon.

I think as I said, it's what we talked about six months ago.

Sanders had to address the convention tonight and his supporters already filling the streets, protesting all day yesterday and today expected.</p><p>Breaking news meanwhile.

And here with me to break it all down, Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, Maverick PAC national co- chair, Morgan Ortagus, and republican strategist, Tony Sayegh.</p><p>Good to see you, everybody.</p><p>TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Shall we kick it off, we get here and the first thing is distraction. <person><nameText>Debbie Wasserman Schultz </nameText></person>is out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said that how do democrats say unity? That's how you say unity for democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. But we've got that coming up.</p><p>To join us this morning we've got a great line up. Former adviser to President Bill Clinton and author of \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat Hillary,\" Dick Morris is with us this morning.</p><p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will join us.

Former astronaut, husband of former Representative Gabriel Gifford, and co-founder of American for Responsible Solutions, Mark Kelly is joining us this morning. And former Michigan Governor and senior of Correct the Record, a super PAC67 backing <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>Jennifer Granholm will be with us as well.</p><p>Disorder at the DNC this morning. A major shakeup rocking the Democratic Party emitted in the e-mail scandal just hours before the Democratic national Convention kicks in Philadelphia.</p><p>Let's get right to Blake Burman, he's here in Philly with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Maria. God morning to you as well. Debbie Wasserman Schulz will gather in the Democratic National Conventional later today. She'll give a speech at some point this week. Gavel it out on Thursday and that will be it.</p><p>For her is that the Democratic National Committee as Wasserman Schultz yesterday resigned from the top post at the DNC. Of course, this is due to the fallout of the WikiLeaks scandal. WikiLeaks over the weekend releasing some 19,000 plus e-mails that showed during the primary process.</p><p>Top democratic officials, some of them favored <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>over <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>even in some states trying to tip the scales towards Clinton. Wasserman Schultz herself even had some choice words when describing Sanders campaign manager.</p><p>Now, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was asked about those e-mails over the weekend, in an interview with 60 Minutes. I should note that she gave this interview before Wasserman Schultz officially submitted her letter of resignation. Hear now <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>about the e-mails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: I didn't know anything about it and I haven't read any of those. But I am adamantly opposed to anyone bringing religion into our political process.</p><p>Again, I don't know anything. I don't know anything about -- about these e- mails. I haven't followed it. But I'm very proud of the campaign that I ran.</p><p>I can't speak to what people who were not working for me, who were saying whatever they were singing. I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Donald Trump as you might was not staying silent during all of this. He had several responses via Twitter. Among them I'll read you one here, quote \"Because the democrats are in a total meltdown, but the biased media will say how great they are doing. E-mail say the rigged system is alive and well.\"</p><p>Of course, Maria, Trump has been saying that the system was rigged against <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders. </nameText></person>He will try to use this to try to sway some Sanders to his side, and in something that you can't make up, Maria. The theme here tonight for the democrats, \"United together.\" Ted Cruz and all of that was so last week. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true. I mean, so much conversation about last week, and yet here we are kicking this often and this happens. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman with the latest there.</p><p>I want to bring in former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a former presidential candidate himself and Fox News contributor. Congressman, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First, your reaction to the e-mail scandal, WikiLeaks releasing 20,000 e-mails and that's obviously it came to life.</p><p>KUCINICH: What reflects the culture inside the Democratic National Committee. And as such, I think that when you add up all of the things, setting the debate schedule that was insufficient, that super delegates. There's so many things which basically prove that this election was rigged against <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.</nameText></person></p><p>BARTIROMO: You think, now -- we were talking on the commercial break. You think <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>should do more.</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, I actually think that it's time for him to consider withdrawing the endorsement. Because it's not just about him, it's about the movement that he represents which had 46 percent of the votes for the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: yes.</p><p>KUCINICH: And it was that kind of conduct was totally dismissive of almost half of the democratic voters. And you cannot have that kind of contempt for voters. And I think Bernie, I would -- I think he ought to at least consider withdrawing the endorsement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, we've been talking and hearing from the Democratic National Committee yesterday as this is happening, Tony Sayegh. They kept saying, well, he wasn't going to win anyway. But the truth is we'll never know that for sure.</p><p>SAYEGH: Well, doesn't that confirm the whole idea that it was rigged in the first place.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have to make that -- to make that...</p><p>SAYEGH: And the evolution is crazy, Maria. You and I were together yesterday morning. At that point, <person><nameText>Debbie Wasserman Schultz </nameText></person>has just said she's not going to speak at the convention.</p><p>By the end of the day, and <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>interview had I think a lot to do it. She was out as the head of the DNC. But, Congressman, I agree with you. I think <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>should be strong and may be reconsidering his endorsement. It doesn't sound like he's going to do that though. But it sounds like his followers are pretty darn mad.</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, they are. And, you know, as a former candidate for president, I can tell you that, you know, you cannot expect the people who support you to just go lockstep when then you say. And so that, you know, there's the Bernie movement is a little bit separate from what the candidate might want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUCINICH: And I want to go back to what you just said, Maria, where the DNC's excuse was he wasn't going to win anyways. In other words, their conduct, actually help to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where Bernie was locked up because the game was rigged.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. And remember when we were watching all of those democrats, we were all scratching our heads saying, why are they doing it when the playoffs are on.</p><p>KUCINICH: Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why are they doing it on a Saturday night when no one watches - - or Sunday night. I mean, they were all very low, you know, viewing night when they did these debates.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR: But, Congressman, don't you think this is immedicable larger cultural problem within the DNC within, you know, when <person><nameText>Debbie Wasserman Schultz </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>this the second e-mail scandal in the past year with the Democratic Party.</p><p>But don't you think that the party itself needs to look and say, you know, we have a cultural leadership problem here where we're allowing this cronyism to go on and fair tactics to go on that if the Republican Party did, we'd be skewered for doing this.</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, that is true. But let's go one step further. This is a whole new era where technology is impacting politics in a powerful way.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Right.</p><p>KUCINICH: This is the millennial will understand this better than anyone. Because you don't put anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't expect to have to read publicly. And so, the politicians are just getting caught up.</p><p>And I think caught up and I think that what it reflects is an older political culture that a pre-internet and it hasn't really caught up.</p><p>And so, again, but there has to be some kind of and say this is not right. This kind of politics cannot be -- cannot be -- cannot continue.</p><p>SAYEGH: Congressman, I suspect that this has disturbed you as much as it disturb me and others. The idea that it was revealed they were contemplating using <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>religious beliefs...</p><p>ORTAGUS: Yes.</p><p>SAYEGH: ... as a campaign issue. And at the time where particularly as republicans were often demonized by our opponents for being racist, being bigoted in some fashion. Certainly our presidential candidate today is assail by those things.</p><p>Doesn't that reveal hypocrisy that they were actually willing to do it against their own?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, I think it goes a little bit worse than hypocrisy. Here's why. The head of the DNC, Jewish, OK. And probably so. An that's a good thing. But how can you have under lengths trying to trap somebody, you know, about his religion which also happens to be Jewish.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUCINICH: I mean, it boggles the mind. And so, this is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The cultural problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One of -- the e-mails was -- one of the officials basically saying somebody needs to ask him, do you even believe in God. And then he said, look, my peeps in West Virginia are going to -- that will really resonate with them, you know. Maybe he is an Atheist. Now he's Jewish.</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, you know, the question now is that the DNC believe in fairness? Does the DNC believe in the Constitution of the United States and Freedom of Religion?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUCINICH: Does the DNC believe in trying to unite the party?</p><p>ORTAGUS: I wouldn't be surprise to see two campaigns to have sort of e- mails going back and forth. But I think the crucial difference here is not that these are two campaigns. This is the Democratic National Committee overtly planning how to take one of their candidates.</p><p>KUCINICH: There's no way to defend us. It's indefensible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tonight, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>will speak. Tonight, we'll see what he says. We'll see if he addresses this. That's' going to be something to watch.</p><p>KUCINICH: he's going to need to address.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And Michelle Obama, the First Lady will speak tonight. So, we will be obviously covering that. Congressman, good to see you.</p><p>KUCINICH: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Congressman Kucinich there. We will be live from the Democratic National Convention tonight in Philadelphia all week. Don't miss our special primetime coverage, I'll here that off tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern, followed by Lou Dobbs and Trish Regan. So, do join us for our special coverage tonight.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are following the breaking news out of a nightclub shooting in Fort Myers, Florida. At last two people are dead, 17 injured. We will bring you the very latest from this deadly shooting in Florida.</p><p>Yahoo, meanwhile may have finally found a new home in Verizon. Reports say Verizon is set to announce the nearly $5 billion deal this morning. Interesting to know that back in the day Microsoft was willing to pay $48 billion. Verizon will pay 5 billion. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A fatal shooting at a Florida nightclub early this morning to report. Cheryl Casone with the story and the other headlines right now in our New York headquarters. Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Maria. Well, officials say that at least two people were killed and as many as 17 others injured in a shooting outside of a Florida nightclub. This happened just after midnight in Fort Myers at Club Blu.</p><p>Gunshots ring out in the parking lot and at this hour there are two active crime scenes that we know off. Authorities say that injuries range from minor to life-threatening at this hour.</p><p>Three people have been taken into custody and the investigation is continuing right now. We'll bring updates if we get them, Maris.</p><p>Also this today, a deadly heat wave continuing to blanket parts of the United States. Six people including a 12-year-old boy in Arizona who died from the heat as near triple digit temperatures sports state from New York all the way to California.</p><p>Cody's mom was hiking in the snowy mountains when he suffered a fatal heat strike. This happened in Phoenix, Arizona. Across the country, Maria, temperatures got in 100 today, in particular in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. The heat index could be much higher if you combine the temperature and humidity.</p><p>And finally, in business headlines this morning, the long process is over. It appears that Verizon has come out on top in the biddings for Yahoo. Reports said that Verizon has agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo. That report includes Yahoo's core internet business and its finance news and sports sides along with some real estate from the company.</p><p>Maria, the deal expected to be announced today. Take a look at buzz stock, Yahoo right now, Maria. The stock is flat, the pre-market, but Verizon is up just lately. Back to you in Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to bring in the CIO of Recon Capital, chief investment officer, Kevin Kelly. Kevin, good to see you. What are your thoughts on this deal? I think it's just so extraordinary that back in, you know, back in the, what was it, early 2000, Microsoft made a bid of -- a bid of $48 billion for Yahoo. And here we are looking at a deal $4.8 billion or 5 billion.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS CEO: Yes. You're bringing up a great point. I mean, Marissa Mayer as well as other regimes have actually decrease shareholder value pretty significantly for Yahoo. But what's nice to know is that this is finally over.</p><p>Shareholders actually wanted Verizon to complete this deal. You can see with the stock they really weren't attributing any value to this core Yahoo. Yahoo right now when you look at the share price, it's really factoring in Alibaba in its share price.</p><p>So, this is great news for shareholders because they now they can move on with it. But, I mean, Marissa Mayer said she would not mess up. The Tumbler rock was a shame. She said the sales process would go smoothly. It was anything but people didn't know what was her sale. You could but this, or you could buy that, including the real estate the patents they didn't know.</p><p>So, this is a good deal, especially for Verizon. So, they thought Yahoo was going to hold them up on the sales process and actually ask for more, but this is a fair price.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kevin, let me ask you. The other technology earnings really going to be in headlines this week. That Apple coming out with earnings. You've got Google parent Alphabet coming out. And I believe Amazon, is that going to set the tone. What are you expecting from some of these high- profile tech names this week?</p><p>KELLY: That will set the tone this week, especially when you actually have over a dozen central banks making actions including the Federal Reserve here. People are going to focus on the largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 and that is tech.</p><p>So, people are going to start seeing how these managements are going to guide going forward. When you look at the tech sector, it provides the largest growth out of any sector as well. It has net cash on the balance sheets so people are going to start going into these names if you start to see dividends increase in the tech sector, which could be great for the market this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. It's all about -- it's all about earnings and it's about guidance, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And I wanted to just point out Marissa Mayer, she gets terminated with this acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon. She gets $50 million.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's already earned 100 million in cash and other compensation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, it's a sweet payday for basically driving the company into the ground.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fifty million.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Kevin.</p><p>Coming up, democratic party leaders facing outrage ahead of the convention over leaked e-mails. And the Clinton campaign is pointing the fingers at Russia. Russian hackers, that's next.</p><p>And then if you're in the market to buy a home, maybe it's fair to act fast. Homes are selling faster than a year earlier. What you should do to win the housing wars, straight ahead.</p><p>Back in a moment on Mornings with Maria, live from Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>reacting to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. That ahead of today's kickoff to the Democratic national Convention.</p><p>Here's what she said in an interview to 60 Minutes last night when asked about her responsibility there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: So, when this happened in Benghazi, I immediately stood up an independent committee, distinguished Americans from the military civilian experts. They came out and they said, you know, the ball was dropped in security. And, you know, some of the decisions that were made probably should have been rethought.</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT: But wasn't that your ball to carry?</p><p>CLINTON: No, it wasn't. It was not my fault to carry. It was there with -- read the -- read the reports. Read all of the reports all many hundreds of pages of them including this latest one, which was a political exercise from the very beginning. Those never reached me. Those never came to my attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, Pete Hegseth. He's also a Fox news contributor. Pete, your reaction to that.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, IRAQ &amp; AFGHANISTAN VETERAN: Good morning. The reaction is she continues to be sort of arrogantly dismissive of the entire team. She'll say immediately, yes, I had some responsibility but no responsibility. It never reached my level.</p><p>And I wish Scott Pelley had asked the real question about, well then why did you lie to people, that to me the biggest scandal.</p><p>For a week afterwards you lied about what you knew to be the real reason for the attack. But there was a political expedient narrative that you push forward. He never asked that follow up question. I think she needs to continue to be asked that question. Because she has no answer.</p><p>The evident shows she told her daughter one thing and then lied to the families of the fallen and said something else. She has never taken responsibility for this and never taken it seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you would think -- I mean, this was September 11, 2012. And they had this whole narrative that there was a video, and then they sent Susan Rice out there on all the Sunday shows.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But to his point, the most disgusting thing about it which she still won't own is that the she told the family...</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: ... that very lie that was cooked up by the administration for political purposes. And then when she talks about in the interview, it was not my ball to carry in terms of the security...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who's fault was it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: ... in the program. Right. You're running -- again.</p><p>ORTAGUS: She's the Secretary of State.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She was the Secretary of State, how did you operate. how did you behave in that leadership post and you expect the American people to vote you to run the nation.</p><p>ORTAGUS: And then, you know, in any leader and organization when something goes wrong the buck should stop with the leader. And this is what I was talking to earlier about my point of this culture within her campaign in the DNC.</p><p>That I think the story would have been a lot sooner if she would have just said I was the Secretary of State, ultimately it's my responsibility. But the fact that she still can't take any responsibility as why this narrative keeps going and going and going. And I don't know why she doesn't get it. You're in charge, take responsibility.</p><p>HEGSETH: That's exactly right. Leaders assert themselves in times of difficulty not fade to the background which is exactly what she did hiding behind other people. There's a scandal before this current scandal during Benghazi and the scandal afterwards is what we still need to pin her down on because she's never been able to explain why she lied.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And no one will forget the famous quote at this point when she was testifying to Congress what difference does it make at this point.</p><p>Let me move on to this WikiLeaks dump of 20,000 e-mails. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>campaign is pointing fingers at Russian hackers for the DNC e-mail scandal ahead of the convention. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is disturbing to us is that we, experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these e- mails. And other experts are now saying that they are -- the Russian are releasing these e-mails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump.</p><p>I don't think it's coincidental that these e-mails were released on the eve of our convention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know. To help Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH: They have theories that Donald Trump is pro-Putin and as a result Putin state actors are working to poured out e-mails to the DNC. Again, they're trying to obfuscate confuse create a counter narrative for the irresponsibility and their inability to secure...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ORTAGUS: She's still on tough election right now. Putin is in re-election at the moment which is quite tough, you know, in Russia? So, I think he has his own affairs to worry about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She still insists which she went of her way to point out in the 60 Minutes interview that her e-mail server, that her e-mails weren't compromise. Well, we'll wait and see if that's the case because if the server was hacked you know those e-mails are going to show up.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, but this whole leak is so really dangerous for the DNC because the truth is now everything they say, I don't know, people are questioning. Because it's like, well, you just created a narrative yourself that <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>might not be Jewish and then he's an Atheist.</p><p>So, now I'm going to believe this new narrative that you've just come up with that Donald Trump is behind somehow this DNC leaked? I mean, it's hard to believe anything now.</p><p>HEGSETH: Indeed. And from the media as well as you see collusion with the media on the stories they're running in by Politico and elsewhere. Hey, does this make sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ken Vogel for Politico actually showed them his story before he published.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes. But, doesn't it fit the narrative that Donald Trump is that they're lying to you? That it's all of a fussed; this is exactly what this does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I feel I love the fact that one woman in the Democratic Party lost her job over an e-mail scandal and another one gets nominated to run for president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. All right. We will -- well, there you go. Pete and Dagen, great insights. Pete Hegseth there.</p><p>A rocky start to the Democratic National Convention for sure as protesters take to the streets before the official kick off.</p><p>More on what to expect live on the ground from Philly.

Key speakers tonight include first lady, Michelle Obama, and Senator <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.</nameText></person></p><p>Fox News's Doug McKelway is live in Philly with a preview. Doug, good morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS: Morning Maria, and there's been a bit of breaking news from the Democratic National Convention this morning. They have announced that the keynote speaker for tonight will be Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. This is probably a very, very sound decision by the DNC.</p><p>As you know, Elizabeth Warren has been an attacked dog nipping at heels of Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign she goes head-to-head with him in Twitter wars, and matches insult for insult. And so, in that sense, it will probably a very -- be a very effective strategy in trying to divert attention from the story DuJour of the Democratic National Convention. The story of the convention, thus far, which is the e-mail scandal and the resignation of Chairman <person><nameText>Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</nameText></person></p><p>She has come to a bit of a soft landing in the sense. She has been picked up by the Clinton campaign to serve as an honorary co-chairman. But the damage has been done, and her resignation is something that had to be done, because -- simply to see her coming out on this stage, you know, walk out on a daze (ph) in front of all these delegates to face a chorus of boos in a way that Ted Cruz faced, of course, the boos when is he failed to introduce Donald Trump and to support Donald Trump at the Republican convention. Something they did not want to see repeated here.</p><p>Clinton has been successful in alienating herself from the scandal as well as she told \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>HILLARY CLINTON, </nameText></person>DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE: I don't know anything about these e- mails, I haven't followed it. But I am very proud of the campaign that I ran. I can't speak to people who were not working for me, who were saying whatever they were saying, I can't speak to that. I can only speak to my campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: For his part, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>has remained remarkably calm throughout this scandal. His convention speech also scheduled to be delivered tonight. Will be chock-full of insults directed at Donald Trump, compliments directed towards <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>but he won't be firing away from within the Democratic tent, perhaps because he is long suspected a conspiracy to deprive him of the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>: I think it's outrageous, but it is not a great shock to me. It's what we talked about six months ago. I mean, there's no question to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that the DNC was supporting <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>was in opposition to our campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: Those allegiances of <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>supporters are not being as gentle as that thousands gathered on the streets of downtown Philadelphia yesterday to protest. It was a larger gathering than anything we saw.</p><p>In Cleveland, albeit, it was a peaceful demonstration. They'll be moving up to this neck of the woods today about 20 miles north of where they protested yesterday to FDR Park.</p><p>The impressive thing about their appearance there yesterday was, they came out in intense heat and humidity, did not dissuade them did at all. Today, a different situation, we had downpours here in Philadelphia. We'll see if they've been able -- if they will be able to withstand that. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Doug thanks so much. Doug McKelway there -- here in Philly with us. How will the DNC e-mail leak impact day one and the views of delegates and voters.</p><p>I want to bring in former advisor to President Bill Clinton and co-author of the new book, \"Armageddon, How Trump Can Beat Hillary\" and that is, of course, Dick Morris. Dick, good to see you.</p><p>DICK MORRIS, ARMAGEDDON AUTHOR: Good to be here with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you think? What's the impact of all this?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, I think that it's notable that Trump went out of his way to appease the conservatives in his party who he largely defeated by naming Pence. And Hillary went out of her way to name Kaine, who is clearly not a liberal and does nothing to placate Sanders and Warren.</p><p>So when Sanders and Warren addressed the convention tonight, the big thing we'll notice is that they would not chosen to be vice president. And in a sense -- no matter how attractive they are, people are saying that shows that their views and Hillary's are fundamentally different. So I think it really casts a shadow over the whole thing. But, you know Maria, it can get worse. When .</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you mean it can -- how is it going to get worse?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, when a bomb hits you, you wonder if the plane is still overhead. And on June 14th, there was a leak from anonymous sources in Russia, probably the Kremlin, that they possessed a number of Hillary's state department e-mails. And that they may release them at a time that might be inconvenient to Hillary, and that's something to keep your eye on all convention. Because that would establish that the e-mail server was hacked and was hacked by our enemies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah. That's really interesting, Dagen, because this whole time she is saying we weren't hacked, everything is fine.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Which in the interview with \"60 Minutes\" she went out of her way to make that point and put an exclamation on the discussion about that very e-mail server.</p><p>I want to ask Dick this in terms of a Tim Kaine picked The Wall Street Journal editorial page, essentially says that Tim Kaine is a pick for when she wins, so -- and when she begins to govern, that she seems to be so confident in getting the far left vote, and in getting the votes that -- of Sanders or Warren would appeal to, that she's basically skipping November and going right to governing starting in January with Tim Kaine.</p><p>MORRIS: Well, I can't think that she is that na\u2039ve. I think there's a different explanation for Tim Kaine. You're right. It's confounding as a political proposition. But I think that the key is Tim Kaine's letter that he sent to the banks three days before he was nominated, avowing that he would opposed stricter regulation of the big banks.</p><p>Now, normally when you're on a short list for V.P. you keep your mouth shut. But he overtly sent that letter, and I think it was to get the banks to lobby Hillary to put him on the ticket. And I think that what you are seeing here is Hillary reassuring her financial controllers that she's still on the reservation by picking Kaine.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PACK NATIONAL CO-CHAIR: Dick, good morning. This is Morgan. I'm wondering, what can <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>say tonight? And the comparison that I'm thinking it was four years ago, Bill Clinton sort of saved Barack Obama in his reelection by giving that powerful speech at the convention. Do you expect <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>to pull a Bill Clinton four years ago or a Ted Cruz last week when it comes to <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>tonight?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, I think it will be a Bernie. And I think he will use the opportunity to articulate again his points of view. I think he'll attract Trump aggressively. I think he'll mildly praise Hillary. But I think that the real point here is that his voters are the swing the vote in this election.</p><p>Try to make that point in -- on again, in my book. The Republicans can run not just with the right jab, doing the conservative issues but they need to throw a left hook coming around Hillary and talking to the Sanders voters in the rear. And I think Trump did a very good job of that in his speech. And I think this e-mail scandal and the choice of Kaine both of which essentially to have lifted the Democratic Party to stop it, really undermine Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's been trying to do that. You know, Trump trying to reach out to those <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>voters and Hillary is being forced to defend the multiple scandals surrounding her and her entire political record. She gave that first interview with the V.P. choice Senator Kaine, and Clinton claimed that she is judged on a different standard than others are judged. Listen to this Dick Morris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: I think that it is fair to say there has been a concerted effort to convince people like that young man of something. Nobody is quite sure what but of something. I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and then there's the standard for everybody else.</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, \"60 MINUTES\" HOST: What's the Hillary standard?</p><p>CLINTON: Well, it is, you know, a lot of as you saw at the Republican Convention, unfounded, inaccurate, main spirited attacks with no basis in truth reality which take on a life of their own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORRIS: Well .</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you think? Is there a Hillary standard?</p><p>MORRIS: I'm glad his speech writer didn't call it a vast right-wing conspiracy. May be they used that one already. But I think that -- yeah, when somebody comes out of a bar at night, they had a nice drink. When the guy has five DUI (ph), there's a question to whether they shouldn't have been in that bar in the first place, and that is the Hillary standard.</p><p>But I think that it is -- when we look at this convention, Donald Trump used this convention to show who Donald Trump is. He was front and center of his family, his wife, his kids. Hillary is going to use this convention to hide herself. She is not running. The first woman is running. She's not running, pro-choice is running and pro-gun control. She's the only person between Donald Trump and the presidency.</p><p>And in .</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is great analysis, yeah.</p><p>MORRIS: . in fact she advances through generic rather than through the specific of her.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, that's a great point. You know, and maybe (ph) she might also have created that standard for herself by just doing things like, oh, I am going to -- you have my own e-mail server, because that's what I'm going to do and nobody else can do that.</p><p>TONY SAYEGH, JAMESTOWN ASSOCIATES: The most of these in part of that interview was she said that all these concerns about her honesty untrustworthiness were baseless. Meanwhile, we know from the Clinton Foundation contribution for foreign government, the server and et cetera, but Delegates County saying, you've known <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>for decades. You advise the Clintons a long time ago. Has Hillary changed or is this the same Hillary you sat down with face to face when you first met the Clinton's back. I believe it was in the 80's.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Real quick, Dick.</p><p>MORRIS: I think best say to say it, she's metastasized. In the beginning, there was the incipient dishonesty, there was the incipient paranoia and secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS: There was the incipient dishonesty corruption but it's grown. It's metastasized. It's taken her over. You know a person from 70 years old, you knew when they were 30, and you could see them going off the track but not that much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>MORRIS: But then a 60s and 70s you say, oh, my god, look at what they've become, that's Hillary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know them really well. And Dick, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>MORRIS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, quite morning in terms of futures. Take a look, we're really not far from where the market finished the day yesterday, and yet earnings really driving the story. Handful of names on the new this morning.</p><p>SolarCity is (inaudible) higher. The company reportedly closed to emerge their deal with Tesla. Reuters is reporting that the two companies are in final stages of talks in carrying out due diligence on a potential deal. Stock as you can see looking higher.</p><p>Well, the initial report of the deal came out last month. Questions were raised because Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and the Chairman of SolarCity. Musk has refused himself from voting on this deal.</p><p>We'll continue to track the latest development following a fatal explosion in Germany yesterday. Cheryl Casone with that right now and the other head lines from our New York headquarters. Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Yeah, that's right Maria. The various interior minister says he believes the incident was likely an Islamist suicide attack. Police say a 27-year old Syrian man blew himself up after he was turned away from an open air music festival in Ansbach.</p><p>Police believe the man who killed himself was motivated after being denied asylum in Germany. He was already known to them for a recent drug misdemeanor. At least 12 others were injured in the suicide attack.</p><p>We'll here at home. A wildfire in Southern California, destroying 18 homes and rapidly gaining straight two days after it broke out. The fire being described as a freight train by some setting so much smoke into the air that planes making water drops on it, had to be grounded (ph) at one point. Thousands of people forced to evacuate.</p><p>This fire Maria has burned at least 34 square miles but fire officials say that size may now have doubled. Of course, it's dark in California. We'll see what happens when the sun comes up this morning.</p><p>And finally, the housing market, showing signs of improvement. (Inaudible) said that homes are selling an average of a week faster than they did just one year ago. This is the supply of nearly 5 percent lower than last year. Homes are being sold after about 78 days on the market. The average U.S. home is currently worth $187,000, Maria, that's a 5.4 percent increase from June of last year. That's for prices from 2015.</p><p>But Maria, remember, that we're also looking about 3.5 percent for the 30- year fixed year mortgage right now, that's also affecting sales. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Cheryl. Spotlight on technology this week, setting the stage on market. Coming up, we're going to preview the week. We'll tell you what to expect, out of a whole host (ph) of earnings within the tech sector.</p><p>Plus, we're coming to you live from Democratic National Convention here in Philadelphia. We'll tell about what to expect as the DNC kicks off today. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Let's check market this morning with a lot of earnings coming out this weekend some economic data that will certainly set the tone and the Fed. Two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve is having this week.</p><p>Ahead of all of that, the market is looking fractionally higher. It keeps going back and forth though between positive and negative territory, this following another record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Investors are gearing up for a slow of Vect (ph) technology earning including S&amp;P components, Apple which is also a Dow component, reporting earnings tomorrow. Facebook is out on Wednesday. Amazon is out and Google parent Alphabet are out with their results on Thursday.</p><p>This is going to be a big week. You also have a two-day Federal Reserve meeting which ends on Wednesday. We're not going to see rates move higher but we're going to be focused on the language out of the Fed, and what they say or suggest about the next meeting.</p><p>Recon Capital Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Kelley with us standing by in our New York studios. Technology earnings should set the tone, what do you expect on earnings? Is the Fed a factor? What drives market this week, Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN KELLEY, RECON CAPITAL CIO: It's going to be a very, very wild week especially for the Nasdaq 100. You're going to have about 40 percent of the companies reporting this week alone. So that's going to dictate a lot of the market action.</p><p>And as you alluded to earlier, the big tech names are really going to drive that but also biotech will be reporting this week as well. And you're seeing a lot of these names, are big growers in their space, except for Apple. Apple is expected to have 22 to 25 percent revenue decline and that's because of the refreshed cycle on the iPhone.</p><p>So, we're going to have to see where software and services going that route but you're seeing all the other names including Facebook, Amazon. You're seeing their growth be pretty significant, above 20 percent on the top line revenue growth and 15 percent on the earnings growth.</p><p>So people are really going to be focused on that, because companies are going to give their guidance, but it's expected to do very well. And these are companies that are giving a good value. So when you look at the tech sector alone, it's training in a 20 perfect discount to its forward earnings on a historical basis. So, people maybe getting into this and really actually help make this sector move higher and move the overall market higher this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even Amazon? That's the company that's -- not going to cover up the flow (ph), right Dagen? That stock is up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Price is up -- maybe price for perfection and the question is, in terms of the forward-looking earnings are those estimates wrong? Do they need to come down because that made -- that could make the stocks not look like .</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm not beating (ph) against Amazon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, Apple is down 6 percent this year. It really fell off a cliff. It's come back a little bit but in terms of potential upside there, I've heard people talking about that.</p><p>KELLEY: Yeah .</p><p>BARTIROMO: With Amazon -- yeah.</p><p>KELLEY: It's really limited upside on Apple but -- just so you know on the Amazon front, Amazon is a great company that hasn't really focused on earnings. They've really focused on revenue growth. So when people start talking about a fundamental basis and their earnings, you can't focus on that, because what they could do is they could actually slash all of their expenditures and really make it into a great value stock if they wanted to but they're not focused on that. That's why you're seeing in perform quarter over quarter on a basis. That's why you're seeing lead even in the Cloud space.</p><p>So, their Amazon is going to be a company that ends up being a Cloud company that happens to have an eCommerce platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah. You know what? Investors have not been bothered by that that they focus on revenue growth. They keep buying the stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They can hold their nose only so long and then they have to breath through their nose and look out block (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see. Kevin, any other highlights from your standpoint? Do you care about the Fed, Tuesday, Wednesday?</p><p>KELLEY: I don't think the Fed is really muted right now especially because people are not expecting a move, and if they are expecting a move they're looking it to be in December or early next year. So people -- investors aren't really focused on that, and they're not even focused on the bank of Japan either because of the move last month.</p><p>So, people were going to be focused on the market. Yup, exactly. All about earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, I think (ph) the Japan, is on Friday. All right, Kevin, thank you.</p><p>We are awaiting big news this morning form month all about earnings from Verizon reports out that say it is going to be completing inking a $5 billion deal to acquire Yahoo. What it means for CEO Marissa Mayer and shareholders of Yahoo and Verizon. Back in a minute.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
