I'm Tom  Hudson.  Stocks fall on fresh signs that even the Federal Reserve is not  sure how much is enough when it comes to boosting the economy, by buying  government bonds.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Good evening.  I'm  Susie Gharib.  Can two weaklings become strong by teaming up?  That's what  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are hoping for, as they decide to  merge.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:  And a bit of a mixed picture on American housing, contractors  break ground on more single family homes, but pull back on building  apartments and condos.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  We have that and more tonight on NBR.  How much longer should  the Federal Reserve continue to stimulate the economy?  That question was  intensely debated at the central bank's policy meeting in January according  to the minutes that were released today.  Stocks sold off on that news, as  investors worry the Fed might taper off its stimulus program sooner than  expected and before its goal of seeing a big pick up in the job market.  </p><p>  Now the Fed has been buying $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities  and Treasuries every month to pump up the economy.  Here's what those Fed  minutes revealed.  Many policymakers voiced concerns about potential costs  and risks from more bond buying.  Others said that the easy money policies  might encourage excessive risk-taking and that could have adverse  consequences for financial stability.  Policymakers also noted positive  developments in the economy, as more businesses are optimistic about the  economic outlook.  But nervousness about the Fed's next moves pulled down  stocks.  On Wall Street the Dow lost 108 points, closing below the critical  14,000 level.  The NASDAQ was down about 50, the S&amp;P lost 19 points.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Before the Federal Reserve's notes on its last meeting were  released this afternoon, we saw a mixed report this morning on the American  housing market.  Construction starts on new homes fell 8.5 percent in  January.  But that drop in the headline number was pulled down by a drop in  apartment and condominium construction.  The number of single family homes  that began going up last month rose 0.8 of a percent up to its highest  level since the great recession.  Darren Gersh digs deeper.  </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In housing, one  month does not a trend make.  Analysts shrugged off the news that housing  starts fell last month.  Instead they're looking to encouraging trends on  home prices, rents and overall demand.  </p><p>  JED SMITH, MANAGING DIR., NATL ASSN. OF REALTORS:  There are going to  be these squiggles, blips in the market as things happen, just because they  happen from month to month -- snow storms, weather, holidays, whatever, but  right now we are in a recovering market.  </p><p>  GERSH:  Homes sales are up more than 10 percent over last year and  builders are picking up the pace.  They are now on track to build around  900,000 homes this year, but by the end of the year, the National  Association of Realtors expects the pace to pick up to an annual rate of  1.1 million starts.  That's great, but keep in mind a normal year for home  construction is closer to 1.8 million.  The outlook for apartments and  other multi-family construction is also good, even though those starts  dropped last month.  Rents rose 4.5 percent last year and researchers at  Zillow expect a similar increase this year.  That's why investors are  pouring into the market and building new apartments.  </p><p>  STAN HUMPHRIES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ZILLOW:  Assuming you can buy the  property cheaply or build it cheaply and you can rent it out, then you're  seeing 4.5 percent growth in your top line numbers for what you are able to  rent it out for looks pretty attractive.  </p><p>  GERSH:  But the outlook varies depending on where you live and how  strong the job market is in your area.  </p><p>  SMITH:  The market will be up a lot more in Texas than it will be in  parts of the east coast.  Of course, on the west coast we've got a bit of a  housing shortage.  Inventory is tightest there.  So I think there we will  continue to see starts and see more starts in the future, simply because  we've got tight inventory.  </p><p>  GERSH:  Economists say housing is far from normal but it is now strong  enough that it's once again playing its traditional supporting role for the  economy following a tough recession.  Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Joe Davis joins us now.  He's chief economist at Vanguard.   That's the giant mutual fund company.    Joe, nice to have you with us on  this important day.  Let me start by asking you, do you think the Fed is  taking on too much risk?  </p><p>  JOE DAVIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VANGUARD GROUP:  I think there is an  argument that can be made.  We've had a concern for more than a year that  there are both costs as well as benefits with respect to very aggressive  monetary policy.  And just some of the behavior we've seen in the financial  markets.  I know the earlier report talked about excessive risk taking.  So  I've had a concern that those costs associated with monetary policy may not  have been given the sort of credence they should have been.  So a positive  development in my mind, to today's minutes was that Federal Reserve  policymakers were more aggressively talking about both the pros and cons  with respect to aggressive monetary policy.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  One thing that we've been hearing repeatedly from the Federal  Reserve is that they're not going to make any change in this policy,  raising interest rates or anything like that, until the economy is  stronger.  Most notably that the job market picks up, that the unemployment  rate gets to the 6.5 percent level.  So given today's numbers that we've  had on housing and given that we're seeing that gasoline prices are going  up, is the economy really strong enough to even begin talking about raising  interest rates?  </p><p>  DAVIS:   I don't know about that, but I think it is important to start  talking about the beginning of the end in terms of how aggressively the  Federal Reserve has purchased certain securities, particularly fixed-income  securities.  And so I think in that regard, I would make the case that the  economy is markedly stronger today than it was just a year or two ago.  You  mentioned housing.  The business sector, consumers are less debt-burdened  than they were two or three years ago.  And so by those measures, I'm hard- pressed to find the reason why six months from now, the Federal Reserve  would have the pedal to the floor of the car so to speak as they have had  for the past two or three years.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  What is going to be the time table on this?  To some extent,  we saw with the gold prices today and oil prices that commodities are  already responding to some changes in the marketplace.  But when do you  think that the Fed realistically will be acting on an exit strategy?  </p><p>  DAVIS:   I think the exit strategy will be over the next six to 12  months in terms of more vocal conversations and guidance with respect to  the amount and the frequency of their purchases.  I think a later stage is  then contemplation of raising interest rates, raising the Fed funds rate,  which is effectively at zero.  I think there it will be much more important  on the labor market front in terms of job progress.  I think all the other  conditions are in place to see a modest acceleration in job growth, but it  is going to take some time to bring that unemployment rate down, if I'm  correct, that some Americans return to the labor force.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  One concern for a lot of people as investors is what do I do  now?  A lot of people started putting money in the market.  I know you're  an economist, but you also are at Vanguard with all of the mutual funds.   What is the view at Vanguard about what investors should be doing right  now, given the uncertainty about this and things going on in Washington?  </p><p>  DAVIS:   I think the hardest thing to do but I think what many  investors actually are doing is to actually look through some of these  headlines, to embrace that long-term orientation, look at the balance and  risks and what you're trying to achieve with your portfolio.  And if that  ascertation (ph) of that plan is the same today as it was two, five, 10  years ago, it is really critical to stick with that plan.  I think even  going back three years ago, our message to clients was, listen, the  economic environment may be challenging, but you can still have decent  portfolio returns.  And actually since that time, we've had decent  portfolio returns, both on the equity market as well as in bond portfolios.   So continuing to reaffirm that message and for investors to stay invested  in markets.  Because we are going to have ups and downs as the economy just  muddles through some of this.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  A lot more to talk about and we'll continue this  conversation, but we have to wrap it up for now.  Thanks so much, Joe  Davis, chief economist at Vanguard.  </p><p>  DAVIS:   Thank you, Susie.  </p><p>  RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Still ahead,  Martha's in the middle of a courtroom showdown between two major retailers.   What's at stake for the stores and her brand?  </p><p>  HUDSON:  There is progress to report tonight from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on  the battery issue plaguing its 787 Dreamliner.  Still the planes remain  grounded this evening.  The aircraft maker may have found a fix for the  plane's battery problems, by making bigger gaps between battery cells,  that's according to Reuters.  Boeing's head of commercial engines is  expected to meet with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration  Friday to present a 10-point plan to prevent battery fires or meltdowns.   Neither Boeing (NYSE:BA) nor the FAA are commenting.  Boeing (NYSE:BA)  shares rose slightly today to close at $74.78 per share.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Two big and struggling office supply companies are teaming  up.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) is merging with Office Max in a stock deal  valued at more than $1 billion.  A union of the two companies has been  rumored for years, given trouble in the office supply sector.  But  investors didn't buy in to the concept.  Shares of Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  tumbled 16 percent; Office Max fell 7 percent and even rival Staples  (NASDAQ:SPLS) was down today on the news, off 7 percent.  Erika Miller  reports.  </p><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you want a  good  read on the economy, it helps to watch demand for office supplies.  When  the economy is booming, businesses need more pens, paper and printers.  But  growth has been weak since the great recession and that has meant less  demand for office products.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max have  been struggling behind industry leader Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).  </p><p>  LIANG FENG, SPECIALTY RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  Staples  (NASDAQ:SPLS) is just -- their retail store is about 25-30 percent more  productive than comparable locations.  And they also have much more  attractive business customer mix.  They have the mid-size customers,  compared to Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max which are dependent on  the lower margin large customers.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max hope by merging, they  will be able to save big bucks by closing stores, combining operations,  cutting advertising costs and negotiating better prices from suppliers.   But office supply stores are also facing stiff competition from Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  Those retailers  have lower cost structures which often means lower prices.  What's worse,  the office supply stores are losing their most lucrative customers.  </p><p>  FENG:  Your highest margin customers are your small business customers  or somebody who just wants to buy something for the home office.  And what  we've seen is that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are  targeting these higher margin small business customers.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Those struggles are reflected in the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  and Office Max stock prices.  Shares of both companies have plunged more  than 70 percent from their highs back in 2006 and 2007, respectively.   Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tried to merge in 1997,  but the deal was blocked by regulators because of fear it would lead to  higher prices.  But most industry experts give this deal a high probability  of going through.  Longer-term, this deal is expected to be good for Office  Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max, but also their biggest competitor.  If  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max close stores, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)  will face competition.  Erika Miller, NBR, New York.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Combined these two companies have about 2,000 retail stores  in North America.  And as Erika just mentioned, some of those stores are  expected to close, if the deal happens.  That potentially could leave  vacant millions of square feet of commercial real estate.  Brian Jones is a  portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman real estate fund.   He joins us  tonight from the NASDAQ.  Brian, what kind of shape is retail real estate  in as it faces what could be a pretty big consolidation?</p><p>  BRIAN JONES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE FUND:   Well, thank you for having me tonight.  I think retail real estate is in a  very good situation right now.  What we've seen over the past two years  have been improving occupancies and in many of the better markets, we're  beginning to see rental rate growth.  This is largely driven by the fact  that there is very little new construction of retail centers going on in  the United States currently.  And thus, any retailers looking to grow have  to find space in the existing centers in order to fund and continue their  growth efforts.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Let's assume that Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are  successful in combining their resources.  Does this square footage,  presumably that would become vacant in the years ahead, actually help  relieve some of the pressure that you're seeing today?  </p><p>  JONES:   Well, what we would say is that these two tenants are still  relatively small when compared to the total pie of retail real estate.   When we looked at the REITs in our coverage universe, we found that  combined, Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max were in every case at less  than 2 percent of the rental revenues for the REITs in our coverage  universe.  So together, they're relatively small tenants for the overall  retail REIT universe and the retail space in general.  What it will provide  is the opportunity for some of the retailers that have growth plans to  actually find centers to grow in.  And so we think that over time, a lot of  the stores that are closed will be released to stronger tenants.  And in  many cases, that will end up strengthening the underlying center, where the  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) or the Office Max have gone out.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  You mentioned your coverage universe and you did bring along  one kind of outdoor shopping real estate investment trust that you do like  here, Federal reality investment trust, ticker on this one is FRT.  What  make this on stand out in a crowded market?  </p><p>  JONES:   One thing I would like to point out is that this highlights  one of the benefits of investing in REITs, as opposed to a single piece of  direct real estate.  Most of the retail REITs in our coverage universe own  dozens, if not hundreds, of retail centers.  So they're generally  diversified by geography or by tenant mix and by product type.  So Federal  realty is an excellent example of a retail REIT that owns high quality  centers in areas that have high population densities and above average  incomes.  And these are the locations where many of the growing retailers,  such as TJ Max and Marshal's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Rack, Five Guys Burgers,  Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) -- the retailers that are looking to grow are  focused on these higher income, higher density markets.  And this is where  Federal is positioned.  And we think that they are positioned to do well in  the future.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  OK.  </p><p>  JONES:   Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are not within their  top 25 tenants.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Gotcha.  And that's something you like at this point for FRT.   Do you have a position in the fund in that stock?  </p><p>  JONES:   Yes, we do own Federal reality in our mutual funds, the  Neuberger Berman real estate fund.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  And you help manage it.  It is Brian Jones along with us  tonight from Neuberger Berman.  Thanks Brian.</p><p>  JONES:   Thank you.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  It's Macy's (NYSE:M) versus JC Penney in a high stakes fight  over bed linens, cocktail napkins and kitchen tools.  At issue here, who  will be allowed to carry products with Martha Stewart's name on them?   Macy's (NYSE:M) has been selling Stewart's merchandise since 2007.  It  claims it owns the exclusive rights to carry her home furnishings.  But  rival JC Penney argues it has the right to sell other Stewart-branded  products that Macy's (NYSE:M) doesn't carry.  Ruben Ramirez reports.  </p><p>  RAMIREZ:  Martha's in the middle, as two of the nation's best-known  department stores fight in New York State Supreme Court over just who can  carry the domestic diva's home products.  </p><p>  GREG LITTLE, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE:  Two different companies are  looking at the same agreement and are interpreting it different ways.   Macys is interpreting it very broadly; Penney's is interpreting it very  narrowly.  </p><p>  RAMIREZ:  There's no denying the appeal of carrying Martha Stewart's  brand.  Macy's (NYSE:M) says it has billions of dollars on the line.  </p><p>  MICHAEL APPEL, FOUNDER, APPEL &amp; ASSOCIATES:  For Macys, having a  differentiated exclusive brand is critical to their competitive strategy  and they've invested a lot of time and effort in building up the Martha  Stewart brand, giving her exposure in the stores and it's a linchpin of  their home strategy.  </p><p>   RAMIREZ:  For, JCP, Martha is a key part of its store within a store  turnaround plan.  </p><p>APPEL:  She can appeal to the kind of customer that Penney's has and  the customer whom they want to get which is more I think a little more  upscale than what they have right now.</p><p>  RAMIREZ:  Penney's is counting on a clause in Stewart's original  contract with Macy's (NYSE:M), which allowed her to open stand-alone  stores, arguing the clause never said that stand alone shops could not be  inside a bigger store.  If JCP is successful, Appel says it opens up  another retail channel for Stewart's company.  </p><p>APPEL:  The merchandising end of her business is the only part of her  business right now that is growing and is profitable and for her to be able  to increase her distribution is critical to her business strategy.  </p><p>  RAMIREZ:  The trial got underway in a Manhattan Federal courtroom  today and now that it's begun, attorneys say a settlement could be coming.  </p><p>  LITTLE:  There is something about a trial that forces parties to look  at the facts a little bit differently than they do when they're not at  trial and it may well be that they reach a compromise at that point.  </p><p>  RAMIREZ:  Martha Stewart, along and the CEOs of both Macy's (NYSE:M)  and JC Penney are expected to take the stand.  The trial is slated to last  about two-and-a-half weeks.  But unlike other courtroom cases which are  decided by a jury, one judge will decide the outcome of this one.  Ruben  Ramirez, NBR, New York.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  In the \"Market Focus\" here today, what started out as just  some mild selling picked up this afternoon with some Federal Reserve  officials worrying about how long to keep buying bonds to help the economy.   Here's the daily trade for the S&amp;P 500.  Now the news from the Federal  Reserve came out just after 2:00 Eastern time. That's when the index  starting seeing some selling momentum.  The index finished down by 1.2  percent.  Remember though, it was at a five and a half year high at  yesterday's close.  Trading volume though did pick up, 815 million shares  moving on the big board, two billion traded on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>  All 10 of the major stock sectors were lower today.  The materials  sector seeing the biggest loss, down 2.8 percent followed by the selling  that we saw in energy and consumer discretionary sectors.  </p><p>  Two gold and copper miners saw the heaviest selling among those  material stocks.  Gold and copper metal prices were down sharply today.   Freeport McMoran falling 6 percent.  This is a two-and-a-half month low for  FCX.  Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) falling 5.5 percent, NEM tonight at a new  52-week low.  AA, aluminum maker Alcoa (NYSE:AA) hit too, falling 3.3  percent.  Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been seeing aluminum prices stabilize.  </p><p>  In addition to the drop in new home construction last month, we heard  from home builder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL).  It earned $0.03 per share in  the last quarter, certainly an improvement from the loss a year ago, but  considerably less than estimates.  The company reported that average  selling prices were lower.  Shares were lower as well, falling 9 percent.   The stock has lost 10 percent in less than a week after staging a big rally  over the past year.  Other homebuilder stocks getting hit.  Pulte Group  falling 6.8 percent, DR Horton off by 5.8 percent.  </p><p>  Foxconn is not a household name in the U.S., but if you use an Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) computer or many other  dozens of other electronic devices, Foxconn is the Taiwanese company that  assembles it.  Today Foxconn said it has frozen the hiring of assembly line  workers in China after the lunar holiday there.  That fed speculation about  demand for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and HP products.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares  falling 2.2 percent since the plant affected makes iPhone fives, but  Foxconn said its decision is not related to making the iPhone.  An analyst  at investment banking firm UBS thinks it could be instead because of less  demand for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) desktop computers.  HPQ shares down  by 1.1 percent.  HPs quarterly earnings are due tomorrow after the closing  bell, one to watch.  </p><p>  Independent energy companies Devon and Anadarko updated their  shareholders on their latest strategies.  Both though were greeted today  with selling.  APC is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), down 4.5 percent.  Its  energy production outlook was less than expected while its forecast for  capital spending was more than anticipated.  Anadarko says it expects to be  among the most active deepwater drillers this year.  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) falling 6.6 percent after saying it may try again to spin off  its pipeline and processing businesses.  It tried that six years ago, but  stopped after the economy weakened.  </p><p>  Four of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were  lower on the broad market sell-off.  The S&amp;P 500 volatility note though  jumped 8.6 percent.  It usually moves in the opposite direction of the  broad market as it did today.  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  GHARIB:  Whether it's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram or Pinterest,  there always seems to be a hot start-up in the tech pipeline.  But as  tonight's commentator explains, the next big tech company might not be as  original as you think.  He's Harry Lin, executive-in-residence at Idealab.  It's a technology incubator in Pasadena, California.  </p><p>  HARRY LIN, EXECUTIVE-IN-RESIDENCE, IDEALAB:  An irony in the world of  technology start-ups is that we tend to copy each other a lot.  I call this  ironic because the image of tech start-ups is that they're all about  innovation and risk taking.  Yet, venture capital investors and tech  entrepreneurs all know that for every Instagram that gets launched, there  are at least 10 other start-ups that pretty much are Instagram, just with a  different name.  Did you know that there are at least three well-funded  startups?  I'm talking more than $10 million of investor capital, that  match dog owners with dog sitters?  The number of me-too start-ups goes  crazy when you look at other types of products and services:  project  management software, call ordering food online, music streaming, cloud file  storage and I can't even keep track of all the fashion and clothing sale  sites duking it out on the Internet.  There are scores of them! Even  Pinterest has at least half a dozen straight up clones.  </p><p>   So why is an industry that's supposedly about innovation and  disruption so quick to copy itself?  Investors may call their capital  venture, but they're looking for safe bets.  So when something seems to be  working, why not invest in the same thing?  We also know that in some  niches, there's space for several winners, so maybe investing in the me-too  will work out.  The entrepreneurial myth is that we invent new stuff, when,  much of the time, we engineer twists or slants on old stuff.  It's really,  really hard to come up with a brand-new idea that's never been tried.  So  this copy-catting will continue and I'll continue to call it ironic.  I'm  Harry Lin.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Whether copy cats or not, all entrepreneurs certainly face  difficulty at one time or another staying motivated.  Our NBRU partners at  Vanderbilt University have eight steps for staying motivated to reach long- term goals.  Just head to nbr.com and look for that NBRU tab.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  And let's take a look at what's coming up tomorrow on NBR.   Ford is hiring.

I'm Susie Gharib.  Home prices head higher, as the housing recovery digs  in.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  I'm Tom Hudson.   McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) shares tumble though.  The fast food giant posts its  first monthly sales drop in nearly a decade.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  And the U.S. futures market, it's been hit by scandal, but  investors are still buying in.  We continue our look at confidence and the  markets.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  That and more tonight here on NBR.   </p><p>There's more evidence tonight the housing market is recovering.  Two  reports today show home prices jumped significantly in the second quarter.   And it's a classic story of supply and demand.  Fewer homes for sale has  helped push up prices for those looking for buyers.  Here's the data.  Real  estate data firm CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) finds home prices up 6 percent.   Freddie Mac's survey has prices up 4.8 percent.  This are the largest  quarter over quarter price hikes in at least seven years.  Housing had been  a drag on the economy, but fewer homes for sale and record low mortgage  rates have really continued to repair the sector even though consumers  remain cautious.  </p><p>And we saw the latest data that (INAUDIBLE) that caution from  McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) today.  July sales at the fast food restaurant fell  flat, surprising investors and sending its stock lower.  Sales at U.S.  stores open for more than a year fell slightly last month, down 0.1 of one  percent.  That marks the first time in almost a decade monthly sales didn't  rise.  Like other analysts, Morningstar's RJ Hottovy expects sales to slow,  but thought they'd still be positive.  </p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  Whether it be sluggish  wage growth and an uneven housing recovery and just a lot of headlines  about a worsening global macroeconomic picture, I think a combination of  those have definitely put consumers in a more value oriented mindset and  that's something that will probably continue in the months to come.  This  may not be the last month that McDonalds puts up a slightly negative same  store sales results for the U.S. </p><p>GHARIB:  McDonalds was one of the big losers here on the big board  today and that pressured stocks.  But the Dow still eked out a fourth day  of gains.  Here are the numbers. The blue chips rose seven points, the  NASDAQ slipped four and a half and the S&amp;P added nearly a point.  </p><p>So get ready for a pull back in stocks.  That's what our market guest  is telling his clients.  He's Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells  Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors.  So Scott, let's talk about that pull back.   When, how big and why are you thinking that? </p><p>SCOTT WREN, SR. EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS:  Well, Susie,  I think probably over the next couple of months, we are very susceptible to  headlines out of Europe.  I think that the ECB will certainly be in at some  point buying Spanish and Italian debt.  But I don't think it's going to be  as soon as the market wants.  Much of this rally was based on what the Fed  might do, also what the ECB might do.  So I think it's very possible the  Fed does do some easing.  I think it's very possible and very likely the  ECB does go in and buy some bonds.  I just don't think it's going to be as  soon.  I think the market's a little bit ahead of itself.  I think probably  you could see certainly a 5 percent pullback and possibly upwards of a 10  percent pullback, but really on a pullback like that, we're looking at that  as an opportunity.  We want our clients in there taking advantage of a  pullback like that and adding to positions.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Let me pick up on some of the points that you made there,  first of all, about policy action.  Investors do seem to be banking on the  Federal Reserve and the European central bank doing something.  Let's say  they do.  Is that a long term or just a temporary boost to the market?  </p><p>WREN:  I think that -- let's look at the Federal Reserve.  If they do  a QE3, in my opinion I would have to doubt the effectiveness as that.  I  almost feel there's kind of pushing on a string.  I think there's a lot of  liquidity in the system.  It's just that there's no velocity of money.   Confidence is down and people don't want to really borrow and spend.  The  ECB is in a much more dire situation.  Spain and Italy both have a lot of  debt this year that they need to roll over and there's just not very many  investors stepping up to buy that.  So I think the ECB is in a very dire  situation.  They are likely to act sooner.  But let's be certain. If we  have sub-two percent GDP growth and 8 percent plus unemployment, the  Federal Reserve is not going to sit on its hands and do nothing.  </p><p>GHARIB: You just tell people (ph) fundamentals there. But let me ask  you, let me make the positive case and there are a lot of market guests who  come on our program.  They point to those housing numbers, for example.   Housing is making a recovery. We just talked about that at the top of the  show, also corporate profits coming in better than expected.  They always  talk about some kind of Fed action.  But none of that resonates with you.   You're still (INAUDIBLE) on a pullback.  </p><p>WREN:  Well I think and let me say this -- our year end target on the  S&amp;P 500 is 1400 to 1450, so we're inside at the bottom range of that  target.  And I'm very confident in that year end target.  I just think that  we came to this level a little bit too fast.  I think we came to this level  because of anticipated action by central banks.  That's probably a little  further out than what the market thinks.  </p><p>GHARIB:  We have about 20 seconds left.  Talk to us about investor  confidence.  We're running a whole series this week about this subject.   What are your clients telling you about their confidence level?  </p><p>WREN:  Retail investor confidence level is low.  They're fearful.   They're afraid to get back into the market no matter what the valuations  are.  So our clients have a lot of cash on the sidelines, and one of my  main jobs is to point out to people that you're going to be living longer.   You're going to need to grow your money.  You're going to need to  participate in the global and U.S.  growth and one of the best ways to do  that is going to continue to be stocks.  You need to be invested in the  stock market.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Lots of good information.  Scott, thanks a lot, Scott Wren at  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors.  </p><p>WREN:  Thanks, Susie.  </p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Diane  Eastabrook.  Still ahead, I'll tell you why the futures market isn't what  it used to be.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Fine coffee (ph) at some Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the  future, may only take your name.  The catch is you'll have to have a  special pay with Square ap on your smart phone that announces your arrival  at the cash register.  It's part of a new partnership announced today  between Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Square.  That's the mobile payments  start-up run by one of the co-founders of Twitter.  The deal calls for  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to invest $25 million in Square.  Square will also  process all of Starbucks' credit card payments, at significant savings.   Earlier today, NBR's Erika Miller spoke with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO  Howard Schultz and Square CEO Jack Dorsey.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   I would imagine  that every big tech company has been beating at your door begging for a  mobile payment deal.  What do you think that Jack and Square is the right  partnership for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?  </p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, CEO, STARBUCKS:  It's true that we have spoken to most  of the high profile blue chip tech companies, all of whom are trying to  crack the code on how to monetize mobile payments.  I think when we met  Square and then Jack, there were a few things that really stuck one.  One  was like minded values of both companies and I think Square's singular  focus on payments and their level of innovation and entrepreneurialship  (sic) and understanding of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) experience quickly  separated them from the pack and it was a very easy choice for us.  </p><p>MILLER: And Jack, talk about what this deal means for Square.  Is it  more than just a positive development?  Is this a game changer for your  company?  </p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, SQUARE:  Absolutely.  It really proves out that the  technology we built scales from the individual and the small business all  the way up to the very largest organizations in the world.  </p><p>MILLER:  Until this point, Square has been focused on small, even  micro businesses.  Does this partnership signal a new focus towards big  global companies?  </p><p>DORSEY:  It's really around that scale.  We're building a technology  that should be treated as a utility, that an individual can come to or a  very large organization can come to it and use it in very similar ways.  </p><p>MILLER:  Howard, it's one thing to encourage local payments in  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).  It's another thing to make a $25 million  investment in a company that's not yet profitable.  Why did you go that  route?  </p><p>SCHULTZ:   I think we've all seen as consumers that the smart phone  has really become the primary device in our life.  The investment we're  making of $i25 million is a significant vote of confidence to Square and  Jack.  We think that is going to create shareholder value for our  shareholders.  </p><p>MILLER:  Jack, this partnership comes at a time when you're facing  stiff competition from the likes of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), from the likes of  Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), big competitors.  Is it game on  now?  Are there going to be a rush to sign up big corporate partners?  </p><p>DORSEY:  We do something very specific which is not just focus on the  mechanics of payments, but actually the experience around it.  Everything  from the point of sale all the way to what's in the consumers' pocket.  And  that bridge between the two is what is powerful and what is meaningful.  </p><p>MILLER:  Howard, I'd like to get your assessment of the global  economy. Obviously you're a big global corporation.  What do you see in  terms of trends?  Are consumers becoming more willing to spend?  Is your  ticket price going up?  What can you tell me about Europe?  </p><p>SCHULTZ:   I think with 18,000 stores in 60 countries, every single  day we have a window into consumer confidence and consumer behavior.  It's  no surprise that over the last few months there's been a significant level  of pressure on consumer behavior and consumer spending in Europe.  I don't  think any of us see that changing any time soon.</p><p>GHARIB:  This deal is obviously a big vote of confidence for mobile  payments.  Do you think (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>DORSEY: It is definitely disappearing.  I can't imagine my grandmother  leaving it at home.  But I think what's always been true about payments is  that the merchant always needs to accept whatever comes over the counter.   They always want to make the sale.  So it's important (INAUDIBLE)to that,  but at the same time recognize the technologies that are coming to make it  easier, to make it faster and improve the experience.  </p><p>MILLER:  hank you both very much for joining us.  </p><p>SCHULTZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>DORSEY:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>GHARIB:  If you live in a political swing state, chances are you've  seen a political ad, or two or 20 in the past few months.  This year's  presidential campaign season already is on pace to be the most expensive on  record.  And with the so-called super pacs able to raise unlimited amounts  of money for political advertisements, the spending is expected to rise.   Sylvia Hall reports.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Summer may be  ending, but the fight for the presidency is heating up.  You just need a  remote control to see it play out.  </p><p>DARRELL WEST, VP &amp; DIR., GOV. STUDIES, BROOKINGS:  The tide does not  rise evenly.  Some battleground states tend to get all the money and last  time around, the top 11 states got 90 percent of the spending.  </p><p>HALL:  Television campaign spending is on pace to break records.  And  this year, super pacs are set to spend huge sums of money on advertising,  for or against the candidates.  </p><p>JACK POOR, VP, TELEVISION BUREAU OF ADVERTISING:  Romney and his  collaborators will probably spend a billion.  Obama will be less than that,  maybe $800 million.  </p><p>HALL:  But most of the country won't see the ads that spring from all  that cash.  So far this year, spending is concentrated in nine swing  states.  By law, campaigns pay fairly low rates for television ad space.   But for super pacs, it's a different game.  Some super pacs pay as much as  twice what a campaign pays for airtime.  </p><p>POOR: The irony is there are a very few number of undecided voters  this year, so we're going to spend $3 billion essentially trying to  persuade 5 to 10 percent of the electorate in nine states.  </p><p>HALL:  If you're in one of those states, you'll have a front row seat  for a presidential campaign that's shaping up to be one of the most intense  and negative on record.  Just listen to some of the most recent attack ads  to hit the airwaves.  </p><p>CAMPAIGN AD:  Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work, you  wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.  </p><p>CAMPAIGN AD:  I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he's done to  anyone.  And furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.  </p><p>WEST:  It's way, way negative, somewhere north of 70 percent negative  to 30 percent positive.  We think that's going to continue and perhaps get  worse.  And one of the big reasons is the pacs, the super pacs.  They're  providing the bulk of the Republican spending right now and a significant  portion of the Democratic as well.  </p><p>HALL:  Nobody knows yet how all this political spending could affect  the businesses who usually advertise on television year round.  The super  pac money could raise ad rates for everyone.  Sylvia Hall, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Toyota (NYSE:TM) says it's only a matter of time before it  starts building more cars in North America and you can thank its native  currency.  A strong Japanese yen is clobbering the country's bottom line or  rather the company's bottom line on U.S. exports.  Toyota's U.S. sales  chief Jim Lentz today said the auto maker's looking at moving production of  Lexus ES sedans from Japan to the U.S.  But he says before making such a  costly move, the company will keep monitoring the yen.  Lentz also re- affirmed Toyota's U.S. sales forecast at 14.3 million vehicles this year,  predicting a pick up in sales after the presidential election.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Those rising home prices we told you about a little earlier  in the program are also helping Fannie Mae.  It reported today a solid  second quarter profit just a day after Freddie Mac did the same.   The  government controlled mortgage giant earned $5 billion.  That works out to  $0.37 a share.  The gains mark Fannie Mae's best quarter in a decade.  So  as a result, the company didn't need to ask for more taxpayer help and Tom,  that's kind of significant because since the financial crisis, Fannie Mae  has relied on loans from American taxpayers something along the lines of  $116 billion.  </p><p>HUDSON: A good development there, positive news in housing here  tonight.  And that's got a little bit of the market going here today Susie.   In our \"Market Focus\"  the major stock indices really kind of meandered  around for most of the day before closing essentially flat.  The S&amp;P 500  did have a choppy session, trading in a very narrow range.  The index saw  its worst and best levels of the day this morning, creating only an eight  point trading range, very narrow.  It ended higher by a fraction, still  enough though for yes a new three-month high tonight.  Trading volume  moderate, 636 million shares on the big board, just under 1.9 billion  moving on the NASDAQ.  Then the consumer was in focus for the markets.  The  consumer staples sector had the best gains, up 0.6 of a percent, while the  consumer discretionary sector was the biggest drag, down 0.4 of one  percent.  </p><p>Now consumer staples are those things we tend to buy because we need  them.  And Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock saw a big pop as the company plans to  spin off its Horizon organic and Silk soy milk business.  Lots of folks  wanting Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock today, shooting up 40.6 percent.  Volume  more than -- jumped seven fold with the stock up to its highest price in  two and a half years tonight.  The firm has hinted for some time about a  possible spin-off, wanting to separate its faster growing business from its  traditional dairy operations.  That news came after the company reported a  stronger than expected second quarter helped out by lower costs.  Earnings  at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) a nickel better than estimates.  The company also  raised its guidance for the year.  And despite the U.S. drought's impact on  grain prices for dairy producers, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) does not think the  impact on dairy prices will be as bad as some predict.  </p><p>Meantime, consumer discretionary companies, firms selling things we  want but may not need, were under some pressure thanks to travel websites.   Priceline.com topped the losers in this area, down 17.3 percent.  Among S&amp;P  500 traded stocks, the lowest price since February after the company's  financial forecast came in short of expectations.  Fellow online travel  site Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) saw even bigger loss, losing more than a  quarter of its value. Its outlook is below expectations as well.   Tripadvisor lost 4.9 percent as the sector moved lower.  </p><p>Meantime, homebuilding stocks - here we go -- higher prices thanks to  the two reports we mentioned at the beginning of the program tonight  showing that home prices were climbing.  This exchange-traded fund in made  up for homebuilding stocks.  With today's 0.8 of a percent gain, it's at  its highest price since May and less than $0.50 away from a four-year high.  </p><p>On HP, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), ticker HPQ, been struggling for a  couple of years, hit by CEO turnover and its traditional computer business  really under pressure by tablets and smart phones.  The company warned it  will take an $8 billion write down due to a drop in its stock and business  in its services unit.  But excluding that massive charge, it raised its  adjusted earnings forecast for the third quarter.  That positive news in  shares certainly responded positively, rising 2.4 percent, heavy traded HPQ  today.  Shares coming off an eight-year low earlier hit this month.  </p><p>After closing just below a five-year high, media giant News Corp  (NASDAQ:NWS) may be one to watch tomorrow.  After the closing bell, shares  sank rather 2.5 percent from this closing price.  The company reported  disappointing revenues.  The company is preparing to spin off its newspaper  publishing business from its television and film operations.  </p><p>It was a mixed day for the five most actively traded ETFs.  Only the  S&amp;P 500 and emerging markets exchange-traded funds eked out some very small  gains.  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>All this week on NBR, we're talking about investor confidence in the  markets.  In the futures market, that confidence has been hit by the  bankruptcy of MF Global and the admitted fraud at PFG Best.  Farmers  started trading futures in Chicago in the middle of the 19th century.   Today, pension funds, hedge funds, individual investors have millions of  dollars s on the line in corn, soybeans and other products.  As Diane  Eastabrook reports, some old-style market participants say these newer  players are making it tougher for them to trade.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  For 164 years farmers, grain elevators and food companies  have used futures contracts traded in Chicago's commodity pits to hedge  risk.  Alpha Baking Company uses them to lock in prices for the wheat and  natural gas used to make its breads and rolls.  President Larry Marcucci's  been trading futures for 30 years.  About eight years ago he noticed it  changed.  </p><p>LARRY MARCUCCI, PRESIDENT, ALPHA BAKING:  It used to be if the market  went up a couple of cents or down a couple of cents a day that was a big  deal.  Then it started bouncing around double digits, $0.10, $0.20 a day.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  Marcucci thinks so called financial participants are the  reason.  They include pension funds, commodity pool advisors and swap  dealers who are trading futures as a way to make money.  Together they can  comprise anywhere from a quarter to nearly half of the market.  </p><p>MARCUCCI:  They add liquidity, but they can drive the market up and  they can certainty drive the market down.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  Speculators have always been crucial to the futures  market, buying a grain contract a hedger is trying to sell.  David Lehman  is the managing director of commodity research and development at the CME  Group (NASDAQ:CME).  He says these new financial participants are improving  the market for hedgers like Marcucci.  </p><p>DAVID LEHMAN, MANAGING DIR., CME GROUP:  Bringing a much broader array  of participants into the market globally, as well as bringing more  liquidity into the markets from investors has actually dampened volatility  as you look at it statistically.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  Lehman says what makes markets volatile is uncertainty.   The current drought is a good example.  And today hedgers and speculators  have instant access to information and can trade electronically 24-7.   University of Illinois agriculture economist Scott Irwin says that can make  for faster moving markets.  </p><p>SCOTT IRWIN, AGRICULTURE ECONOMIST, UNIV. OF ILLINOIS:  But overall  you'd have to say on net it likely means just simply, more efficient,  quicker reacting markets to even more relevant information.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  For Marcucci it now means spending a little less time on  the plant floor and a bit more time monitoring commodity prices.  </p><p>MARCUCCI: I've gone from maybe watching it maybe monthly, to weekly,  to daily, to hourly.  </p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci is still hedging.  He says he thinks that future  provide great assurance for his company.  He's just being a little bit more  cautious about how he uses them in the future.  Tom?  </p><p>HUDSON:  Diane a lot of folks may be looking at the futures industry a  little bit more cautiously now because of the bankruptcy of MF Global that  we mentioned last fall and of course the fraud this summertime of PFG Best.   How has that impacted the trusts of the futures industry?  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  Well, I think from a customer standpoint, where people  like Marcucci, he trusts the markets.  He thinks the markets are  functioning as they should be.  But I think there is some concern that  there needs to be a bit more oversight, particularly of these futures  commission merchants or FCMs like Peregrine and MF Global and regulators  are doing more to look into those companies. They're doing more electronic  audits and are also making extra sure that these companies are not co- mingling their money with customer money.  </p><p>HUDSON:  That's a key point and of course the MF Global collapse was  just a trade that went wrong of course.  With PFG, you've got admitted  fraud.  In fact after the MF Global failure, you sat in the same room with  Russell Wasendorf, Sr.  (ph)  (INAUDIBLE) who is now at the center of the  alleged fraud and he said that it was sacrosanct to keep separate customer  money -- not to co-mingle it. But allegedly now we've learned he was  ripping off customers.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  Yeah.  That's what took a lot of people -- it really  stunned a lot of people, particularly me.  I had interviewed him many times  in the past.  He was a very trusted member of the futures industry.  And I  think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier.  There just needs  to be more oversight and hopefully that's what we'll be seeing.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Looking at investor trust in the futures market here tonight.   It's our Midwest bureau chief, Diane Eastabrook reporting for the CME Group  (NASDAQ:CME) in Chicago.  Thanks, Diane.  </p><p>GHARIB:  When it comes to confidence in the markets, tonight's  commentator says market makers like Knight Capital have a great  responsibility.  Here's Joseph Cotterill, editor at the \"Financial Times.\" </p><p>JOSEPH COTTERILL, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Is it so terrifying that  you should gut your 401(k) of stocks?  You could say that the market itself  absorbed Knight's problem trades pretty well last week.  Those weird prices  died down after that wild half hour.  Even if you trade stocks day to day,  that seems like better resilience than the big flash crash of two years  ago.  If you hold stocks for months or years, you could be feeling pretty  insulated.  Instead, the only downer on your confidence would be the merely  atrocious economy.  </p><p>But that can't be the whole story.  Investors (INAUDIBLE) would be  justified to have second thoughts over the bewildering pace of change in  technology.  These algorithms aren't space invaders or black swans.   They're put in place by market makers locked in an arms race to be the  fastest.  They go fast to get you a tight stock quote.  But weigh that  against the unease when it goes wrong, or, as with Knight, there is no kill  switch.  It needs to be stoppable before it goes live.  Otherwise, it's a  dead market.  I'm Joseph Cotterill.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Tomorrow on NBR, we're going to have some more details about  the appetites of consumers, from the every day shopper to the higher end,  more big retailers report results and outlooks.  Second quarter earnings  due in tomorrow from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).  </p><p>GHARIB:  And finally, Bond, James Bond has always been a box office  hit and now British pay TV service BSkyB is banking on it.  It announced  the launch of a new 24 hour channel dedicated solely to what else, films  featuring the one and only James Bond.  The new channel will launch in  October to mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise and will put the 007  films on (INAUDIBLE) Tom, these guys, they recently bought the rights to  the Britain film franchise from MGM Studios.  </p><p>HUDSON:  I'll see if I can get that channel in the office.  I'm a  sucker any time those films are on.  </p><p>GHARIB:  I love them. But (INAUDIBLE) watch them in the middle of the  report, of the movie.   Anyway, that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for us for  Wednesday this August 8.  Have a great evening everyone and you too Tom.  Take in a movie, a Bond movie.</p><p>HUDSON:  Report, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, ergo (ph) online, nbr.com,  back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Susie Gharib. Home prices head higher, as the housing recovery digs in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I`m Tom Hudson. McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) shares tumble though. The fast food giant posts its first monthly sales drop in nearly a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And the U.S. futures market, it`s been hit by scandal, but investors are still buying in. We continue our look at confidence and the markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more tonight here on NBR.</p><p>There`s more evidence tonight the housing market is recovering. Two reports today show home prices jumped significantly in the second quarter. And it`s a classic story of supply and demand. Fewer homes for sale has helped push up prices for those looking for buyers. Here`s the data. Real estate data firm CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) finds home prices up 6 percent. Freddie Mac`s survey has prices up 4.8 percent. This are the largest quarter over quarter price hikes in at least seven years. Housing had been a drag on the economy, but fewer homes for sale and record low mortgage rates have really continued to repair the sector even though consumers remain cautious.</p><p>And we saw the latest data that (INAUDIBLE) that caution from McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) today. July sales at the fast food restaurant fell flat, surprising investors and sending its stock lower. Sales at U.S. stores open for more than a year fell slightly last month, down 0.1 of one percent. That marks the first time in almost a decade monthly sales didn`t rise. Like other analysts, Morningstar`s RJ Hottovy expects sales to slow, but thought they`d still be positive.</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: Whether it be sluggish wage growth and an uneven housing recovery and just a lot of headlines about a worsening global macroeconomic picture, I think a combination of those have definitely put consumers in a more value oriented mindset and that`s something that will probably continue in the months to come. This may not be the last month that McDonalds puts up a slightly negative same store sales results for the U.S.</p><p>GHARIB: McDonalds was one of the big losers here on the big board today and that pressured stocks. But the Dow still eked out a fourth day of gains. Here are the numbers. The blue chips rose seven points, the NASDAQ slipped four and a half and the S&amp;P added nearly a point.</p><p>So get ready for a pull back in stocks. That`s what our market guest is telling his clients. He`s Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors. So Scott, let`s talk about that pull back. When, how big and why are you thinking that?</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SR. EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: Well, Susie, I think probably over the next couple of months, we are very susceptible to headlines out of Europe. I think that the ECB will certainly be in at some point buying Spanish and Italian debt. But I don`t think it`s going to be as soon as the market wants. Much of this rally was based on what the Fed might do, also what the ECB might do. So I think it`s very possible the Fed does do some easing. I think it`s very possible and very likely the ECB does go in and buy some bonds. I just don`t think it`s going to be as soon. I think the market`s a little bit ahead of itself. I think probably you could see certainly a 5 percent pullback and possibly upwards of a 10 percent pullback, but really on a pullback like that, we`re looking at that as an opportunity. We want our clients in there taking advantage of a pullback like that and adding to positions.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me pick up on some of the points that you made there, first of all, about policy action. Investors do seem to be banking on the Federal Reserve and the European central bank doing something. Let`s say they do. Is that a long term or just a temporary boost to the market?</p><p>WREN: I think that -- let`s look at the Federal Reserve. If they do a QE3, in my opinion I would have to doubt the effectiveness as that. I almost feel there`s kind of pushing on a string. I think there`s a lot of liquidity in the system. It`s just that there`s no velocity of money. Confidence is down and people don`t want to really borrow and spend. The ECB is in a much more dire situation. Spain and Italy both have a lot of debt this year that they need to roll over and there`s just not very many investors stepping up to buy that. So I think the ECB is in a very dire situation. They are likely to act sooner. But let`s be certain. If we have sub-two percent GDP growth and 8 percent plus unemployment, the Federal Reserve is not going to sit on its hands and do nothing.</p><p>GHARIB: You just tell people (ph) fundamentals there. But let me ask you, let me make the positive case and there are a lot of market guests who come on our program. They point to those housing numbers, for example. Housing is making a recovery. We just talked about that at the top of the show, also corporate profits coming in better than expected. They always talk about some kind of Fed action. But none of that resonates with you. You`re still (INAUDIBLE) on a pullback.</p><p>WREN: Well I think and let me say this -- our year end target on the S&amp;P 500 is 1400 to 1450, so we`re inside at the bottom range of that target. And I`m very confident in that year end target. I just think that we came to this level a little bit too fast. I think we came to this level because of anticipated action by central banks. That`s probably a little further out than what the market thinks.</p><p>GHARIB: We have about 20 seconds left. Talk to us about investor confidence. We`re running a whole series this week about this subject. What are your clients telling you about their confidence level?</p><p>WREN: Retail investor confidence level is low. They`re fearful. They`re afraid to get back into the market no matter what the valuations are. So our clients have a lot of cash on the sidelines, and one of my main jobs is to point out to people that you`re going to be living longer. You`re going to need to grow your money. You`re going to need to participate in the global and U.S. growth and one of the best ways to do that is going to continue to be stocks. You need to be invested in the stock market.</p><p>GHARIB: Lots of good information. Scott, thanks a lot, Scott Wren at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors.</p><p>WREN: Thanks, Susie.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Diane Eastabrook. Still ahead, I`ll tell you why the futures market isn`t what it used to be.</p><p>HUDSON: Fine coffee (ph) at some Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the future, may only take your name. The catch is you`ll have to have a special pay with Square ap on your smart phone that announces your arrival at the cash register. It`s part of a new partnership announced today between Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Square. That`s the mobile payments start-up run by one of the co-founders of Twitter. The deal calls for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to invest $25 million in Square. Square will also process all of Starbucks` credit card payments, at significant savings. Earlier today, NBR`s Erika Miller spoke with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz and Square CEO Jack Dorsey.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I would imagine that every big tech company has been beating at your door begging for a mobile payment deal. What do you think that Jack and Square is the right partnership for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, CEO, STARBUCKS: It`s true that we have spoken to most of the high profile blue chip tech companies, all of whom are trying to crack the code on how to monetize mobile payments. I think when we met Square and then Jack, there were a few things that really stuck one. One was like minded values of both companies and I think Square`s singular focus on payments and their level of innovation and entrepreneurialship (sic) and understanding of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) experience quickly separated them from the pack and it was a very easy choice for us.</p><p>MILLER: And Jack, talk about what this deal means for Square. Is it more than just a positive development? Is this a game changer for your company?</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, SQUARE: Absolutely. It really proves out that the technology we built scales from the individual and the small business all the way up to the very largest organizations in the world.</p><p>MILLER: Until this point, Square has been focused on small, even micro businesses. Does this partnership signal a new focus towards big global companies?</p><p>DORSEY: It`s really around that scale. We`re building a technology that should be treated as a utility, that an individual can come to or a very large organization can come to it and use it in very similar ways.</p><p>MILLER: Howard, it`s one thing to encourage local payments in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It`s another thing to make a $25 million investment in a company that`s not yet profitable. Why did you go that route?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think we`ve all seen as consumers that the smart phone has really become the primary device in our life. The investment we`re making of $i25 million is a significant vote of confidence to Square and Jack. We think that is going to create shareholder value for our shareholders.</p><p>MILLER: Jack, this partnership comes at a time when you`re facing stiff competition from the likes of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), from the likes of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), big competitors. Is it game on now? Are there going to be a rush to sign up big corporate partners?</p><p>DORSEY: We do something very specific which is not just focus on the mechanics of payments, but actually the experience around it. Everything from the point of sale all the way to what`s in the consumers` pocket. And that bridge between the two is what is powerful and what is meaningful.</p><p>MILLER: Howard, I`d like to get your assessment of the global economy. Obviously you`re a big global corporation. What do you see in terms of trends? Are consumers becoming more willing to spend? Is your ticket price going up? What can you tell me about Europe?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think with 18,000 stores in 60 countries, every single day we have a window into consumer confidence and consumer behavior. It`s no surprise that over the last few months there`s been a significant level of pressure on consumer behavior and consumer spending in Europe. I don`t think any of us see that changing any time soon.</p><p>GHARIB: This deal is obviously a big vote of confidence for mobile payments. Do you think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>DORSEY: It is definitely disappearing. I can`t imagine my grandmother leaving it at home. But I think what`s always been true about payments is that the merchant always needs to accept whatever comes over the counter. They always want to make the sale. So it`s important (INAUDIBLE)to that, but at the same time recognize the technologies that are coming to make it easier, to make it faster and improve the experience.</p><p>MILLER: hank you both very much for joining us.</p><p>SCHULTZ: Thank you.</p><p>DORSEY: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>GHARIB: If you live in a political swing state, chances are you`ve seen a political ad, or two or 20 in the past few months. This year`s presidential campaign season already is on pace to be the most expensive on record. And with the so-called super pacs able to raise unlimited amounts of money for political advertisements, the spending is expected to rise. Sylvia Hall reports.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Summer may be ending, but the fight for the presidency is heating up. You just need a remote control to see it play out.</p><p>DARRELL WEST, VP &amp; DIR., GOV. STUDIES, BROOKINGS: The tide does not rise evenly. Some battleground states tend to get all the money and last time around, the top 11 states got 90 percent of the spending.</p><p>HALL: Television campaign spending is on pace to break records. And this year, super pacs are set to spend huge sums of money on advertising, for or against the candidates.</p><p>JACK POOR, VP, TELEVISION BUREAU OF ADVERTISING: Romney and his collaborators will probably spend a billion. Obama will be less than that, maybe $800 million.</p><p>HALL: But most of the country won`t see the ads that spring from all that cash. So far this year, spending is concentrated in nine swing states. By law, campaigns pay fairly low rates for television ad space. But for super pacs, it`s a different game. Some super pacs pay as much as twice what a campaign pays for airtime.</p><p>POOR: The irony is there are a very few number of undecided voters this year, so we`re going to spend $3 billion essentially trying to persuade 5 to 10 percent of the electorate in nine states.</p><p>HALL: If you`re in one of those states, you`ll have a front row seat for a presidential campaign that`s shaping up to be one of the most intense and negative on record. Just listen to some of the most recent attack ads to hit the airwaves.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD: Under Obama`s plan, you wouldn`t have to work, you wouldn`t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD: I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he`s done to anyone. And furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.</p><p>WEST: It`s way, way negative, somewhere north of 70 percent negative to 30 percent positive. We think that`s going to continue and perhaps get worse. And one of the big reasons is the pacs, the super pacs. They`re providing the bulk of the Republican spending right now and a significant portion of the Democratic as well.</p><p>HALL: Nobody knows yet how all this political spending could affect the businesses who usually advertise on television year round. The super pac money could raise ad rates for everyone. Sylvia Hall, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Toyota (NYSE:TM) says it`s only a matter of time before it starts building more cars in North America and you can thank its native currency. A strong Japanese yen is clobbering the country`s bottom line or rather the company`s bottom line on U.S. exports. Toyota`s U.S. sales chief Jim Lentz today said the auto maker`s looking at moving production of Lexus ES sedans from Japan to the U.S. But he says before making such a costly move, the company will keep monitoring the yen. Lentz also re- affirmed Toyota`s U.S. sales forecast at 14.3 million vehicles this year, predicting a pick up in sales after the presidential election.</p><p>GHARIB: Those rising home prices we told you about a little earlier in the program are also helping Fannie Mae. It reported today a solid second quarter profit just a day after Freddie Mac did the same. The government controlled mortgage giant earned $5 billion. That works out to $0.37 a share. The gains mark Fannie Mae`s best quarter in a decade. So as a result, the company didn`t need to ask for more taxpayer help and Tom, that`s kind of significant because since the financial crisis, Fannie Mae has relied on loans from American taxpayers something along the lines of $116 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: A good development there, positive news in housing here tonight. And that`s got a little bit of the market going here today Susie. In our \"Market Focus\" the major stock indices really kind of meandered around for most of the day before closing essentially flat. The S&amp;P 500 did have a choppy session, trading in a very narrow range. The index saw its worst and best levels of the day this morning, creating only an eight point trading range, very narrow. It ended higher by a fraction, still enough though for yes a new three-month high tonight. Trading volume moderate, 636 million shares on the big board, just under 1.9 billion moving on the NASDAQ. Then the consumer was in focus for the markets. The consumer staples sector had the best gains, up 0.6 of a percent, while the consumer discretionary sector was the biggest drag, down 0.4 of one percent.</p><p>Now consumer staples are those things we tend to buy because we need them. And Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock saw a big pop as the company plans to spin off its Horizon organic and Silk soy milk business. Lots of folks wanting Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock today, shooting up 40.6 percent. Volume more than -- jumped seven fold with the stock up to its highest price in two and a half years tonight. The firm has hinted for some time about a possible spin-off, wanting to separate its faster growing business from its traditional dairy operations. That news came after the company reported a stronger than expected second quarter helped out by lower costs. Earnings at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) a nickel better than estimates. The company also raised its guidance for the year. And despite the U.S. drought`s impact on grain prices for dairy producers, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) does not think the impact on dairy prices will be as bad as some predict.</p><p>Meantime, consumer discretionary companies, firms selling things we want but may not need, were under some pressure thanks to travel websites. Priceline.com topped the losers in this area, down 17.3 percent. Among S&amp;P 500 traded stocks, the lowest price since February after the company`s financial forecast came in short of expectations. Fellow online travel site Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) saw even bigger loss, losing more than a quarter of its value. Its outlook is below expectations as well. Tripadvisor lost 4.9 percent as the sector moved lower.</p><p>Meantime, homebuilding stocks - here we go -- higher prices thanks to the two reports we mentioned at the beginning of the program tonight showing that home prices were climbing. This exchange-traded fund in made up for homebuilding stocks. With today`s 0.8 of a percent gain, it`s at its highest price since May and less than $0.50 away from a four-year high.</p><p>On HP, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), ticker HPQ, been struggling for a couple of years, hit by CEO turnover and its traditional computer business really under pressure by tablets and smart phones. The company warned it will take an $8 billion write down due to a drop in its stock and business in its services unit. But excluding that massive charge, it raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the third quarter. That positive news in shares certainly responded positively, rising 2.4 percent, heavy traded HPQ today. Shares coming off an eight-year low earlier hit this month.</p><p>After closing just below a five-year high, media giant News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) may be one to watch tomorrow. After the closing bell, shares sank rather 2.5 percent from this closing price. The company reported disappointing revenues. The company is preparing to spin off its newspaper publishing business from its television and film operations.</p><p>It was a mixed day for the five most actively traded ETFs. Only the S&amp;P 500 and emerging markets exchange-traded funds eked out some very small gains. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>All this week on NBR, we`re talking about investor confidence in the markets. In the futures market, that confidence has been hit by the bankruptcy of MF Global and the admitted fraud at PFG Best. Farmers started trading futures in Chicago in the middle of the 19th century. Today, pension funds, hedge funds, individual investors have millions of dollars s on the line in corn, soybeans and other products. As Diane Eastabrook reports, some old-style market participants say these newer players are making it tougher for them to trade.</p><p>EASTABROOK: For 164 years farmers, grain elevators and food companies have used futures contracts traded in Chicago`s commodity pits to hedge risk. Alpha Baking Company uses them to lock in prices for the wheat and natural gas used to make its breads and rolls. President Larry Marcucci`s been trading futures for 30 years. About eight years ago he noticed it changed.</p><p>LARRY MARCUCCI, PRESIDENT, ALPHA BAKING: It used to be if the market went up a couple of cents or down a couple of cents a day that was a big deal. Then it started bouncing around double digits, $0.10, $0.20 a day.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci thinks so called financial participants are the reason. They include pension funds, commodity pool advisors and swap dealers who are trading futures as a way to make money. Together they can comprise anywhere from a quarter to nearly half of the market.</p><p>MARCUCCI: They add liquidity, but they can drive the market up and they can certainty drive the market down.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Speculators have always been crucial to the futures market, buying a grain contract a hedger is trying to sell. David Lehman is the managing director of commodity research and development at the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME). He says these new financial participants are improving the market for hedgers like Marcucci.</p><p>DAVID LEHMAN, MANAGING DIR., CME GROUP: Bringing a much broader array of participants into the market globally, as well as bringing more liquidity into the markets from investors has actually dampened volatility as you look at it statistically.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Lehman says what makes markets volatile is uncertainty. The current drought is a good example. And today hedgers and speculators have instant access to information and can trade electronically 24-7. University of Illinois agriculture economist Scott Irwin says that can make for faster moving markets.</p><p>SCOTT IRWIN, AGRICULTURE ECONOMIST, UNIV. OF ILLINOIS: But overall you`d have to say on net it likely means just simply, more efficient, quicker reacting markets to even more relevant information.</p><p>EASTABROOK: For Marcucci it now means spending a little less time on the plant floor and a bit more time monitoring commodity prices.</p><p>MARCUCCI: I`ve gone from maybe watching it maybe monthly, to weekly, to daily, to hourly.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci is still hedging. He says he thinks that future provide great assurance for his company. He`s just being a little bit more cautious about how he uses them in the future. Tom?</p><p>HUDSON: Diane a lot of folks may be looking at the futures industry a little bit more cautiously now because of the bankruptcy of MF Global that we mentioned last fall and of course the fraud this summertime of PFG Best. How has that impacted the trusts of the futures industry?</p><p>EASTABROOK: Well, I think from a customer standpoint, where people like Marcucci, he trusts the markets. He thinks the markets are functioning as they should be. But I think there is some concern that there needs to be a bit more oversight, particularly of these futures commission merchants or FCMs like Peregrine and MF Global and regulators are doing more to look into those companies. They`re doing more electronic audits and are also making extra sure that these companies are not co- mingling their money with customer money.</p><p>HUDSON: That`s a key point and of course the MF Global collapse was just a trade that went wrong of course. With PFG, you`ve got admitted fraud. In fact after the MF Global failure, you sat in the same room with Russell Wasendorf, Sr. (ph) (INAUDIBLE) who is now at the center of the alleged fraud and he said that it was sacrosanct to keep separate customer money -- not to co-mingle it. But allegedly now we`ve learned he was ripping off customers.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Yeah. That`s what took a lot of people -- it really stunned a lot of people, particularly me. I had interviewed him many times in the past. He was a very trusted member of the futures industry. And I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier. There just needs to be more oversight and hopefully that`s what we`ll be seeing.</p><p>HUDSON: Looking at investor trust in the futures market here tonight. It`s our Midwest bureau chief, Diane Eastabrook reporting for the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) in Chicago. Thanks, Diane.</p><p>GHARIB: When it comes to confidence in the markets, tonight`s commentator says market makers like Knight Capital have a great responsibility. Here`s Joseph Cotterill, editor at the \"Financial Times.\"</p><p>JOSEPH COTTERILL, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: Is it so terrifying that you should gut your 401(k) of stocks? You could say that the market itself absorbed Knight`s problem trades pretty well last week. Those weird prices died down after that wild half hour. Even if you trade stocks day to day, that seems like better resilience than the big flash crash of two years ago. If you hold stocks for months or years, you could be feeling pretty insulated. Instead, the only downer on your confidence would be the merely atrocious economy.</p><p>But that can`t be the whole story. Investors (INAUDIBLE) would be justified to have second thoughts over the bewildering pace of change in technology. These algorithms aren`t space invaders or black swans. They`re put in place by market makers locked in an arms race to be the fastest. They go fast to get you a tight stock quote. But weigh that against the unease when it goes wrong, or, as with Knight, there is no kill switch. It needs to be stoppable before it goes live. Otherwise, it`s a dead market. I`m Joseph Cotterill.</p><p>HUDSON: Tomorrow on NBR, we`re going to have some more details about the appetites of consumers, from the every day shopper to the higher end, more big retailers report results and outlooks. Second quarter earnings due in tomorrow from Kohl`s (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, Bond, James Bond has always been a box office hit and now British pay TV service BSkyB is banking on it. It announced the launch of a new 24 hour channel dedicated solely to what else, films featuring the one and only James Bond. The new channel will launch in October to mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise and will put the 007 films on (INAUDIBLE) Tom, these guys, they recently bought the rights to the Britain film franchise from MGM Studios.</p><p>HUDSON: I`ll see if I can get that channel in the office. I`m a sucker any time those films are on.</p><p>GHARIB: I love them. But (INAUDIBLE) watch them in the middle of the report, of the movie. Anyway, that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for us for Wednesday this August 8. Have a great evening everyone and you too Tom. Take in a movie, a Bond movie.</p><p>HUDSON: Report, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, ergo (ph) online, nbr.com, back here tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Susie Gharib. Home prices head higher, as the housing recovery digs in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I'm Tom Hudson. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) shares tumble though. The fast food giant posts its first monthly sales drop in nearly a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And the U.S. futures market, it's been hit by scandal, but investors are still buying in. We continue our look at confidence and the markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more tonight here on NBR.</p><p>There's more evidence tonight the housing market is recovering. Two reports today show home prices jumped significantly in the second quarter. And it's a classic story of supply and demand. Fewer homes for sale has helped push up prices for those looking for buyers. Here's the data. Real estate data firm CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) finds home prices up 6 percent. Freddie Mac's survey has prices up 4.8 percent. This are the largest quarter over quarter price hikes in at least seven years. Housing had been a drag on the economy, but fewer homes for sale and record low mortgage rates have really continued to repair the sector even though consumers remain cautious.</p><p>And we saw the latest data that (INAUDIBLE) that caution from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) today. July sales at the fast food restaurant fell flat, surprising investors and sending its stock lower. Sales at U.S. stores open for more than a year fell slightly last month, down 0.1 of one percent. That marks the first time in almost a decade monthly sales didn't rise. Like other analysts, Morningstar's RJ Hottovy expects sales to slow, but thought they'd still be positive.</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: Whether it be sluggish wage growth and an uneven housing recovery and just a lot of headlines about a worsening global macroeconomic picture, I think a combination of those have definitely put consumers in a more value oriented mindset and that's something that will probably continue in the months to come. This may not be the last month that McDonalds puts up a slightly negative same store sales results for the U.S.</p><p>GHARIB: McDonalds was one of the big losers here on the big board today and that pressured stocks. But the Dow still eked out a fourth day of gains. Here are the numbers. The blue chips rose seven points, the NASDAQ slipped four and a half and the S&amp;P added nearly a point.</p><p>So get ready for a pull back in stocks. That's what our market guest is telling his clients. He's Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>(NYSE:WFC) Advisors. So Scott, let's talk about that pull back. When, how big and why are you thinking that?</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SR. EQUITY STRATEGIST, <person><nameText>WELLS FARGO </nameText></person>ADVISORS: Well, Susie, I think probably over the next couple of months, we are very susceptible to headlines out of Europe. I think that the ECB will certainly be in at some point buying Spanish and Italian debt. But I don't think it's going to be as soon as the market wants. Much of this rally was based on what the Fed might do, also what the ECB might do. So I think it's very possible the Fed does do some easing. I think it's very possible and very likely the ECB does go in and buy some bonds. I just don't think it's going to be as soon. I think the market's a little bit ahead of itself. I think probably you could see certainly a 5 percent pullback and possibly upwards of a 10 percent pullback, but really on a pullback like that, we're looking at that as an opportunity. We want our clients in there taking advantage of a pullback like that and adding to positions.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me pick up on some of the points that you made there, first of all, about policy action. Investors do seem to be banking on the Federal Reserve and the European central bank doing something. Let's say they do. Is that a long term or just a temporary boost to the market?</p><p>WREN: I think that -- let's look at the Federal Reserve. If they do a QE3, in my opinion I would have to doubt the effectiveness as that. I almost feel there's kind of pushing on a string. I think there's a lot of liquidity in the system. It's just that there's no velocity of money. Confidence is down and people don't want to really borrow and spend. The ECB is in a much more dire situation. Spain and Italy both have a lot of debt this year that they need to roll over and there's just not very many investors stepping up to buy that. So I think the ECB is in a very dire situation. They are likely to act sooner. But let's be certain. If we have sub-two percent GDP growth and 8 percent plus unemployment, the Federal Reserve is not going to sit on its hands and do nothing.</p><p>GHARIB: You just tell people (ph) fundamentals there. But let me ask you, let me make the positive case and there are a lot of market guests who come on our program. They point to those housing numbers, for example. Housing is making a recovery. We just talked about that at the top of the show, also corporate profits coming in better than expected. They always talk about some kind of Fed action. But none of that resonates with you. You're still (INAUDIBLE) on a pullback.</p><p>WREN: Well I think and let me say this -- our year end target on the S&amp;P 500 is 1400 to 1450, so we're inside at the bottom range of that target. And I'm very confident in that year end target. I just think that we came to this level a little bit too fast. I think we came to this level because of anticipated action by central banks. That's probably a little further out than what the market thinks.</p><p>GHARIB: We have about 20 seconds left. Talk to us about investor confidence. We're running a whole series this week about this subject. What are your clients telling you about their confidence level?</p><p>WREN: Retail investor confidence level is low. They're fearful. They're afraid to get back into the market no matter what the valuations are. So our clients have a lot of cash on the sidelines, and one of my main jobs is to point out to people that you're going to be living longer. You're going to need to grow your money. You're going to need to participate in the global and U.S. growth and one of the best ways to do that is going to continue to be stocks. You need to be invested in the stock market.</p><p>GHARIB: Lots of good information. Scott, thanks a lot, Scott Wren at <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>(NYSE:WFC) Advisors.</p><p>WREN: Thanks, Susie.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I'm Diane Eastabrook. Still ahead, I'll tell you why the futures market isn't what it used to be.</p><p>HUDSON: Fine coffee (ph) at some Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the future, may only take your name. The catch is you'll have to have a special pay with Square ap on your smart phone that announces your arrival at the cash register. It's part of a new partnership announced today between Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Square. That's the mobile payments start-up run by one of the co-founders of Twitter. The deal calls for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to invest $25 million in Square. Square will also process all of Starbucks' credit card payments, at significant savings. Earlier today, NBR's Erika Miller spoke with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz and Square CEO Jack Dorsey.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I would imagine that every big tech company has been beating at your door begging for a mobile payment deal. What do you think that Jack and Square is the right partnership for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, CEO, STARBUCKS: It's true that we have spoken to most of the high profile blue chip tech companies, all of whom are trying to crack the code on how to monetize mobile payments. I think when we met Square and then Jack, there were a few things that really stuck one. One was like minded values of both companies and I think Square's singular focus on payments and their level of innovation and entrepreneurialship (sic) and understanding of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) experience quickly separated them from the pack and it was a very easy choice for us.</p><p>MILLER: And Jack, talk about what this deal means for Square. Is it more than just a positive development? Is this a game changer for your company?</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, SQUARE: Absolutely. It really proves out that the technology we built scales from the individual and the small business all the way up to the very largest organizations in the world.</p><p>MILLER: Until this point, Square has been focused on small, even micro businesses. Does this partnership signal a new focus towards big global companies?</p><p>DORSEY: It's really around that scale. We're building a technology that should be treated as a utility, that an individual can come to or a very large organization can come to it and use it in very similar ways.</p><p>MILLER: Howard, it's one thing to encourage local payments in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It's another thing to make a $25 million investment in a company that's not yet profitable. Why did you go that route?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think we've all seen as consumers that the smart phone has really become the primary device in our life. The investment we're making of $i25 million is a significant vote of confidence to Square and Jack. We think that is going to create shareholder value for our shareholders.</p><p>MILLER: Jack, this partnership comes at a time when you're facing stiff competition from the likes of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), from the likes of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), big competitors. Is it game on now? Are there going to be a rush to sign up big corporate partners?</p><p>DORSEY: We do something very specific which is not just focus on the mechanics of payments, but actually the experience around it. Everything from the point of sale all the way to what's in the consumers' pocket. And that bridge between the two is what is powerful and what is meaningful.</p><p>MILLER: Howard, I'd like to get your assessment of the global economy. Obviously you're a big global corporation. What do you see in terms of trends? Are consumers becoming more willing to spend? Is your ticket price going up? What can you tell me about Europe?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think with 18,000 stores in 60 countries, every single day we have a window into consumer confidence and consumer behavior. It's no surprise that over the last few months there's been a significant level of pressure on consumer behavior and consumer spending in Europe. I don't think any of us see that changing any time soon.</p><p>GHARIB: This deal is obviously a big vote of confidence for mobile payments. Do you think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>DORSEY: It is definitely disappearing. I can't imagine my grandmother leaving it at home. But I think what's always been true about payments is that the merchant always needs to accept whatever comes over the counter. They always want to make the sale. So it's important (INAUDIBLE)to that, but at the same time recognize the technologies that are coming to make it easier, to make it faster and improve the experience.</p><p>MILLER: hank you both very much for joining us.</p><p>SCHULTZ: Thank you.</p><p>DORSEY: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>GHARIB: If you live in a political swing state, chances are you've seen a political ad, or two or 20 in the past few months. This year's presidential campaign season already is on pace to be the most expensive on record. And with the so-called super pacs able to raise unlimited amounts of money for political advertisements, the spending is expected to rise. Sylvia Hall reports.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Summer may be ending, but the fight for the presidency is heating up. You just need a remote control to see it play out.</p><p>DARRELL WEST, VP &amp; DIR., GOV. STUDIES, BROOKINGS: The tide does not rise evenly. Some battleground states tend to get all the money and last time around, the top 11 states got 90 percent of the spending.</p><p>HALL: Television campaign spending is on pace to break records. And this year, super pacs are set to spend huge sums of money on advertising, for or against the candidates.</p><p>JACK POOR, VP, TELEVISION BUREAU OF ADVERTISING: Romney and his collaborators will probably spend a billion. Obama will be less than that, maybe $800 million.</p><p>HALL: But most of the country won't see the ads that spring from all that cash. So far this year, spending is concentrated in nine swing states. By law, campaigns pay fairly low rates for television ad space. But for super pacs, it's a different game. Some super pacs pay as much as twice what a campaign pays for airtime.</p><p>POOR: The irony is there are a very few number of undecided voters this year, so we're going to spend $3 billion essentially trying to persuade 5 to 10 percent of the electorate in nine states.</p><p>HALL: If you're in one of those states, you'll have a front row seat for a presidential campaign that's shaping up to be one of the most intense and negative on record. Just listen to some of the most recent attack ads to hit the airwaves.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD: Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work, you wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD: I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he's done to anyone. And furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.</p><p>WEST: It's way, way negative, somewhere north of 70 percent negative to 30 percent positive. We think that's going to continue and perhaps get worse. And one of the big reasons is the pacs, the super pacs. They're providing the bulk of the Republican spending right now and a significant portion of the Democratic as well.</p><p>HALL: Nobody knows yet how all this political spending could affect the businesses who usually advertise on television year round. The super pac money could raise ad rates for everyone. Sylvia Hall, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Toyota (NYSE:TM) says it's only a matter of time before it starts building more cars in North America and you can thank its native currency. A strong Japanese yen is clobbering the country's bottom line or rather the company's bottom line on U.S. exports. Toyota's U.S. sales chief Jim Lentz today said the auto maker's looking at moving production of Lexus ES sedans from Japan to the U.S. But he says before making such a costly move, the company will keep monitoring the yen. Lentz also re- affirmed Toyota's U.S. sales forecast at 14.3 million vehicles this year, predicting a pick up in sales after the presidential election.</p><p>GHARIB: Those rising home prices we told you about a little earlier in the program are also helping Fannie Mae. It reported today a solid second quarter profit just a day after Freddie Mac did the same. The government controlled mortgage giant earned $5 billion. That works out to $0.37 a share. The gains mark Fannie Mae's best quarter in a decade. So as a result, the company didn't need to ask for more taxpayer help and Tom, that's kind of significant because since the financial crisis, Fannie Mae has relied on loans from American taxpayers something along the lines of $116 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: A good development there, positive news in housing here tonight. And that's got a little bit of the market going here today Susie. In our \"Market Focus\" the major stock indices really kind of meandered around for most of the day before closing essentially flat. The S&amp;P 500 did have a choppy session, trading in a very narrow range. The index saw its worst and best levels of the day this morning, creating only an eight point trading range, very narrow. It ended higher by a fraction, still enough though for yes a new three-month high tonight. Trading volume moderate, 636 million shares on the big board, just under 1.9 billion moving on the NASDAQ. Then the consumer was in focus for the markets. The consumer staples sector had the best gains, up 0.6 of a percent, while the consumer discretionary sector was the biggest drag, down 0.4 of one percent.</p><p>Now consumer staples are those things we tend to buy because we need them. And Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock saw a big pop as the company plans to spin off its Horizon organic and Silk soy milk business. Lots of folks wanting Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock today, shooting up 40.6 percent. Volume more than -- jumped seven fold with the stock up to its highest price in two and a half years tonight. The firm has hinted for some time about a possible spin-off, wanting to separate its faster growing business from its traditional dairy operations. That news came after the company reported a stronger than expected second quarter helped out by lower costs. Earnings at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) a nickel better than estimates. The company also raised its guidance for the year. And despite the U.S. drought's impact on grain prices for dairy producers, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) does not think the impact on dairy prices will be as bad as some predict.</p><p>Meantime, consumer discretionary companies, firms selling things we want but may not need, were under some pressure thanks to travel websites. Priceline.com topped the losers in this area, down 17.3 percent. Among S&amp;P 500 traded stocks, the lowest price since February after the company's financial forecast came in short of expectations. Fellow online travel site Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) saw even bigger loss, losing more than a quarter of its value. Its outlook is below expectations as well. Tripadvisor lost 4.9 percent as the sector moved lower.</p><p>Meantime, homebuilding stocks - here we go -- higher prices thanks to the two reports we mentioned at the beginning of the program tonight showing that home prices were climbing. This exchange-traded fund in made up for homebuilding stocks. With today's 0.8 of a percent gain, it's at its highest price since May and less than $0.50 away from a four-year high.</p><p>On HP, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), ticker HPQ, been struggling for a couple of years, hit by CEO turnover and its traditional computer business really under pressure by tablets and smart phones. The company warned it will take an $8 billion write down due to a drop in its stock and business in its services unit. But excluding that massive charge, it raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the third quarter. That positive news in shares certainly responded positively, rising 2.4 percent, heavy traded HPQ today. Shares coming off an eight-year low earlier hit this month.</p><p>After closing just below a five-year high, media giant News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) may be one to watch tomorrow. After the closing bell, shares sank rather 2.5 percent from this closing price. The company reported disappointing revenues. The company is preparing to spin off its newspaper publishing business from its television and film operations.</p><p>It was a mixed day for the five most actively traded ETFs. Only the S&amp;P 500 and emerging markets exchange-traded funds eked out some very small gains. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>All this week on NBR, we're talking about investor confidence in the markets. In the futures market, that confidence has been hit by the bankruptcy of MF Global and the admitted fraud at PFG Best. Farmers started trading futures in Chicago in the middle of the 19th century. Today, pension funds, hedge funds, individual investors have millions of dollars s on the line in corn, soybeans and other products. As Diane Eastabrook reports, some old-style market participants say these newer players are making it tougher for them to trade.</p><p>EASTABROOK: For 164 years farmers, grain elevators and food companies have used futures contracts traded in Chicago's commodity pits to hedge risk. Alpha Baking Company uses them to lock in prices for the wheat and natural gas used to make its breads and rolls. President Larry Marcucci's been trading futures for 30 years. About eight years ago he noticed it changed.</p><p>LARRY MARCUCCI, PRESIDENT, ALPHA BAKING: It used to be if the market went up a couple of cents or down a couple of cents a day that was a big deal. Then it started bouncing around double digits, $0.10, $0.20 a day.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci thinks so called financial participants are the reason. They include pension funds, commodity pool advisors and swap dealers who are trading futures as a way to make money. Together they can comprise anywhere from a quarter to nearly half of the market.</p><p>MARCUCCI: They add liquidity, but they can drive the market up and they can certainty drive the market down.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Speculators have always been crucial to the futures market, buying a grain contract a hedger is trying to sell. David Lehman is the managing director of commodity research and development at the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME). He says these new financial participants are improving the market for hedgers like Marcucci.</p><p>DAVID LEHMAN, MANAGING DIR., CME GROUP: Bringing a much broader array of participants into the market globally, as well as bringing more liquidity into the markets from investors has actually dampened volatility as you look at it statistically.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Lehman says what makes markets volatile is uncertainty. The current drought is a good example. And today hedgers and speculators have instant access to information and can trade electronically 24-7. University of Illinois agriculture economist Scott Irwin says that can make for faster moving markets.</p><p>SCOTT IRWIN, AGRICULTURE ECONOMIST, UNIV. OF ILLINOIS: But overall you'd have to say on net it likely means just simply, more efficient, quicker reacting markets to even more relevant information.</p><p>EASTABROOK: For Marcucci it now means spending a little less time on the plant floor and a bit more time monitoring commodity prices.</p><p>MARCUCCI: I've gone from maybe watching it maybe monthly, to weekly, to daily, to hourly.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci is still hedging. He says he thinks that future provide great assurance for his company. He's just being a little bit more cautious about how he uses them in the future. Tom?</p><p>HUDSON: Diane a lot of folks may be looking at the futures industry a little bit more cautiously now because of the bankruptcy of MF Global that we mentioned last fall and of course the fraud this summertime of PFG Best. How has that impacted the trusts of the futures industry?</p><p>EASTABROOK: Well, I think from a customer standpoint, where people like Marcucci, he trusts the markets. He thinks the markets are functioning as they should be. But I think there is some concern that there needs to be a bit more oversight, particularly of these futures commission merchants or FCMs like Peregrine and MF Global and regulators are doing more to look into those companies. They're doing more electronic audits and are also making extra sure that these companies are not co- mingling their money with customer money.</p><p>HUDSON: That's a key point and of course the MF Global collapse was just a trade that went wrong of course. With PFG, you've got admitted fraud. In fact after the MF Global failure, you sat in the same room with Russell Wasendorf, Sr. (ph) (INAUDIBLE) who is now at the center of the alleged fraud and he said that it was sacrosanct to keep separate customer money -- not to co-mingle it. But allegedly now we've learned he was ripping off customers.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Yeah. That's what took a lot of people -- it really stunned a lot of people, particularly me. I had interviewed him many times in the past. He was a very trusted member of the futures industry. And I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier. There just needs to be more oversight and hopefully that's what we'll be seeing.</p><p>HUDSON: Looking at investor trust in the futures market here tonight. It's our Midwest bureau chief, Diane Eastabrook reporting for the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) in Chicago. Thanks, Diane.</p><p>GHARIB: When it comes to confidence in the markets, tonight's commentator says market makers like Knight Capital have a great responsibility. Here's Joseph Cotterill, editor at the \"Financial Times.\"</p><p>JOSEPH COTTERILL, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: Is it so terrifying that you should gut your 401(k) of stocks? You could say that the market itself absorbed Knight's problem trades pretty well last week. Those weird prices died down after that wild half hour. Even if you trade stocks day to day, that seems like better resilience than the big flash crash of two years ago. If you hold stocks for months or years, you could be feeling pretty insulated. Instead, the only downer on your confidence would be the merely atrocious economy.</p><p>But that can't be the whole story. Investors (INAUDIBLE) would be justified to have second thoughts over the bewildering pace of change in technology. These algorithms aren't space invaders or black swans. They're put in place by market makers locked in an arms race to be the fastest. They go fast to get you a tight stock quote. But weigh that against the unease when it goes wrong, or, as with Knight, there is no kill switch. It needs to be stoppable before it goes live. Otherwise, it's a dead market. I'm Joseph Cotterill.</p><p>HUDSON: Tomorrow on NBR, we're going to have some more details about the appetites of consumers, from the every day shopper to the higher end, more big retailers report results and outlooks. Second quarter earnings due in tomorrow from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, Bond, James Bond has always been a box office hit and now British pay TV service BSkyB is banking on it. It announced the launch of a new 24 hour channel dedicated solely to what else, films featuring the one and only James Bond. The new channel will launch in October to mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise and will put the 007 films on (INAUDIBLE) Tom, these guys, they recently bought the rights to the Britain film franchise from MGM Studios.</p><p>HUDSON: I'll see if I can get that channel in the office. I'm a sucker any time those films are on.</p><p>GHARIB: I love them. But (INAUDIBLE) watch them in the middle of the report, of the movie. Anyway, that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for us for Wednesday this August 8. Have a great evening everyone and you too Tom. Take in a movie, a Bond movie.</p><p>HUDSON: Report, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, ergo (ph) online, nbr.com, back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

From oil to IPOs, what to expect from the year ahead. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 30th.</p><p>Good evening and thanks for joining us. Susie is off tonight. Investors say good bye to a year of wild market swings and lots of economic worries but also a year that ends very close to where it began for the major stock averages. With today's fractional losses for those averages, the broad market ended the year virtually unchanged. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to end the year on the upside rising 5.5 percent. The NASDAQ closed down this year almost 2 percent. How about the S&amp;P 500, finishing with a loss of 4/100 of a percent, essentially in the same place it was at the end of last year. But for the 11th straight year, gold prices rallied, closing at $1,566 an ounce. That marks a 10 percent gain this year. After this roller coaster ride for investors, 2012 is set to begin with many of the same concerns and uncertainties. Suzanne Pratt reports from New York.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tomorrow evening New York's famed Times Square will be filled with thousands of people celebrating the New Year. On Wall Street, however there will be far less partying as stock investors say good riddance to a tough year. 2011 has been volatile due to Europe's debt crisis, slow economic growth here at home and political uncertainty around the globe. And there's little unanimity among financial pros as to whether 2012 will be an up or down year for the major averages. Still most do agree trading will be sloppy and choppy.</p><p>MIKE RYAN, CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I think we're going to get more of the same. We're going get a lot of volatile markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines.</p><p>PRATT: And those headlines are likely to come out of Europe, at least in the first half of the year.</p><p>VADIM ZLOTINIKOV, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN: You have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose. If it is a path of extreme austerity, you could actually depress the U.S. companies earnings and the U.S. economic growth. If on the other hand it's some combination of monetary easing in a framework for reducing the deficit, that would be viewed by the market as more popular.</p><p>PRATT: No matter what happens in the Eurozone, U.S. economic growth is likely to be muted next year. Yes, there are signs the recovery is gaining momentum. But headwinds are still plentiful. Not only are job prospects for millions of Americans bleak, but the housing market remains in the cellar and there is one more factor likely to create uncertainty for investors in 2012, call it a global changing of the guard.</p><p>RYAN: Think about the countries that potentially face a change in leadership. The United States, China, France, India, Iran, Korea, you know, this is, these are countries that represent about half the world's GDP. So those leadership changes can also be add to the volatility of the markets.</p><p>PRATT: Before you head for the exits permanently, there are at least a few reasons to be positive about stocks in 2012. Corporate profits are expected to remain decent. Companies can still borrow at very low rates and don't forget the oodles of money in corporate coffers.</p><p>ZLOTINIKOV: Companies that are generating a lot of cash and are likely to increase the payout, likely to increase dividends, I want to be clear. This is not a new theme. It is actually an extremely crowded theme. It has been recommended by every single person in the world, doesn't make it wrong.</p><p>PRATT: Investor sentiment is still a big wild card for next year. Trading volume in the last few months has been very low, suggesting a serious lack of conviction. And that is unlikely to change until there's better clarity on Europe. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: All that uncertainty has lead for one of the best place for investors this year, it's the bond market. Most bond mutual funds did better than stock mutual fund funds in 2011. Mutual funds focused on U.S. government bonds gained 9 percent on the year while the average large-cap core stock fund lost 0.3 of 1 percent. What to do after those gains? Well, bond expert Larry Swedroe of Buckingham Asset Management shares a portfolio suggestion for the New Year.</p><p>LARRY SWEDROE, RESEARCH DIR., BUCKINGHAM ASSET MANAGEMENT: I think you should have a well thought out plan, an asset allocation, maybe 60 percent stock, 40 percent bonds or if you are older maybe it is 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks. And then you want to have the discipline to stay the course. And that means after a bond run, you are going to be selling bonds at high prices, meaning you are going to have a nice profit, you get to sell high. And you should be buying stocks at low prices when expected returns are high.</p><p>HUDSON: You can hear more of what Larry says about investing in 2012. The full interview is on our web site, just go to nbr.com.</p><p>On the eve of the New Year and new tension between the west and Iran. The country has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. Seventeen million barrels of oil move through the strait every day. And it's about 20 percent of all oil traded worldwide. Iran has threatened to close the strait if it faces new sanctions over its nuclear program. John Kilduff is with us, founding partner at Again Capital with us at the NASDAQ. John, you've been following the oil market for years. How serious is the oil market taking this new threat?</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, FOUNDING PARTNER, AGAIN CAPITAL: It's taking it relatively seriously. And it's certainly ratcheted up here over the past several weeks. To the western countries' credit, for once, the sanctions are biting in Iran. And that's why you are seeing a reaction by the Iranians to them. And while though I think that they are certainly capable of causing trouble in the strait, we're not there yet in terms of being on the precipice. There's a lot of diplomatic dancing work to go on before that occurs.</p><p>HUDSON: It hasn't impacted global supply yet. Most of that oil that runs through the Strait of Hormuz heads to Asia. We know that China has slowed down a little bit. But does this threaten the Asian economies?</p><p>KILDUFF: Well, it will. It will threaten all our economies if it were to get blocked, even momentarily, even if it is just a single barge let's say in the one of the two shipping lanes. The headline is going to hit the tape. We're all going to buy it and not sort out the details until much later. Because look, it's most of the Saudi oil. It's Iraq's southern production which is half of that country's output that goes through that narrow strait, UAE and Iranian oil for that matter. So it will be a shortage of oil that can't be made up by anyone so that is why the stakes are so high.</p><p>HUDSON: John, what about the ability to reroute some of that Persian Gulf oil to pipelines and take it up to the north?</p><p>KILDUFF: It really is not an option. It's not going to be a sufficient ability. Like I said, the (INAUDIBLE) oil facility off Saudi Arabia's coast which I like to call the world's oil aorta really is irreplaceable, just too much of a volume of oil to displace in any fashion.</p><p>HUDSON: John, we know it is a global market for crude. U.S. crude, domestic oil, meantime, just shy of $100 a barrel as we wind up this year. How about the impact if this threat continues to raise tensions with the Mideast?</p><p>KILDUFF: Yeah, like you said, it is a global market. And the price reverberates around the world no matter where the shortage is. We saw what the Libyan outage did to the Brent crude oil prices and what it did to the west Texas prices as well. It kept it sustained at levels much higher than we otherwise would have been. And even this Iranian situation has probably added a good $15 to $20 a barrel in geo-political premium right now.</p><p>HUDSON: And finally what about the demand picture in the first quarter with Europe still in question?</p><p>KILDUFF: It's going to be very much in doubt. Not only here we're seeing gasoline demand consistently down about 5 percent week in and week out and the Chinese economy is a big question mark. The data we're getting from there is pointing to a slowdown. And whether or not it's going to be significant or not, what remains to be seen. But they are the swing demand center. So the way we talk about Saudi Arabia's oil being so precious to supply, China's demand is equally as precious on the demand side of the equation.</p><p>HUDSON: That's the outlook as we move into the New Year for oil. John, happy New Year to you.</p><p>KILDUFF: Happy New Year to you.</p><p>HUDSON: John Kilduff with us tonight from Again Capital.</p><p>From oil to IPOs this year saw the return of the Internet initial public offering and lots of hype surrounding the trading debuts of stocks like Linkedin and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). But investors did not always buy into the hype. Joya Dass tonight looks back at the year's newest stocks and the IPO everybody is waiting for next year.</p><p>JOYA DASS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: While the markets renewed their appetite for companies going public in 2011, it wasn't the blockbuster year as some had hoped.</p><p>JAMES KRAPFEL, IPO STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR: The companies that went public in 2011, on average under performed the S&amp;P 500 by 12 percentage points.</p><p>DASS: Big tech IPOs Linkedin, Groupon and game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) started off with a bang, but finished the year in some cases with a dull thud.</p><p>KRAPFEL: Groupon was the second one. They were up about 25, 30 percent on the first day, immediately in the first couple of weeks fell about 40 percent. But it has shot back up above its IPO price, which is why, we along with others are very skeptical of that company and their business model.</p><p>DASS: This year's top IPO performers included Imperva, a leader in data security. GNC Holdings, a mall favorite featuring nutrition bars. Tangoe, a telecom group and Tesoro Logistics, a refiner and marketer of petroleum-based products. This year's worst IPO performers included China Century Dragon Media, a Chinese television media buyer. Friendfinder Networks, a dating web site, Imperial Holdings, a specialty finance company and finally Kips Bay Medical, which develops products such as mesh stents for use in bypass surgery. And that brings us to the IPO market for 2012.</p><p>DAVID MENLOW, PRESIDENT,IPOFINANCIAL.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The balance sheets of the companies coming public, the deleveraged aspects of those companies that are coming public, all point to a very strong cycle for the IPO market. And one that is going to put the individual investor or the institutional investor in a very advantaged position because valuation models are at historic lows.</p><p>DASS: Companies David is watching out for include Gogo, the company that provides Internet access aboard planes. Software company with a focus on the TV industry NDS Group Holdings and marketing company Exact Target (NYSE:TGT). And then there is the 800 pound gorilla in the IPO market for 2012 better known as Facebook.</p><p>KRAPFEL: They have a prospectus ready to go, could file for the first time in January and looks like they're targeting a second quarter 2012 filing. They're targeting a $100 billion valuation and look to raise $10 billion.</p><p>DASS: With Facebook revenues expected to top $4 billion for 2011, investors might just like this IPO. Joya Dass for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead from us tonight, pain from paying into college to paying it off. It was one of the big issues for the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement. We'll take a look at the state of student loans.</p><p>A quiet ending today through the year with the major averages sinking just a bit, capping really a volatile year for investors. Let's go ahead and take a look at tonight's \"Market Focus.\" Before we take a look back at the year that was, we will look at today's trading activity with stocks sliding in to the New Year's holiday and the long holiday weekend. The Dow Industrials Average spent almost the entire session in the red. The index continued dropping into the closing bell, ending the session down a little more than one half of 1 percent.</p><p>But as we reported at the beginning of the program, blue chips were the stocks of interest for investors. The Dow gained 5.5 percent this year, outpacing the other major stock averages. And leading the area for the Dow, McDonald's, MCD, shares shooting up more than 30 percent this year as its North American business continued to strengthen even as the company raised some menu prices making up for higher commodity prices.</p><p>On the bottom meantime, the worst Dow stock, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) losing more than half its value as B of A continues battling the weak housing market -- worries about its financial stability and questions about its corporate leadership. Earlier this month, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares dipped below $5 per share. Tonight they are just above $5.50 per share.</p><p>The stocks had plenty of ups and downs clearly this year, but it was not as volatile as some recent years. Thirty eight percent of trading sessions this year had swings of at least 1 percent for the S&amp;P 500. While that is more than last year, it's actually less volatile than what we saw in 2009.</p><p>The year end numbers for the major indices would have been worse if it wasn't for the nice rally in the fourth quarter that we're looking at here. The Dow Industrials popping 12 percent this quarter, S&amp;P 500 up 11 percent. Remember it ended the year flat. The NASDAQ gained almost 8 percent over just the past three months.</p><p>The worst sector for the past quarter though was the telecom sector, dragged down by AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) dropping its buyout effort of T-Mobile. Today Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the telecom company canceling plans and deciding not go through with a new $2 fee for some wireless customers paying their bills over the phone or online. Customers and regulators complained about that. Shares gained just a fraction. It was enough to put Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at a new 52-week high tonight, the stock up 13 percent this year.</p><p>Two other telecom stocks rallying nicely, prepaid wireless provider Metro PCS jumping more than 5 percent on renewed speculation it could be a buyout target in the New Year. And Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR) jumping almost 3 percent. Piper Jaffray began coverage of the stock calling it \"neutral,\" but expecting its dividend to continue in the near term.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, bonds beat stocks this year as investors sought safety despite the U.S. losing its AAA credit rating this summer. The interest rate on the 10-year government note fell today down to 1.88 percent. As the rates fall of course, bond prices rise. This is the first year on record the 10-year note has closed out a calendar year with an interest rate below 2 percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Collectively Americans owe more money on student loans now than we do on our credit cards. Student debt is nearing $1 trillion. This was one of the big issues when college graduates joined \"Occupy Wall Street\" rallies across the country this fall, many of them voicing concern about rising tuition costs and mounting student debt crisis. Sylvia Hall tonight takes a look at what's fueling soaring college costs and how to pay for them.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you went to an \"Occupy Wall Street\" protest, you wouldn't have had to stay long before hearing angry cries of frustrated college graduates. The frustration has been fueled by ever-higher college tuition forcing more students to borrow more money to afford a higher education.</p><p>MARK KANTROWITZ, PUBLISHER, FINAID.COM: I'm very pessimistic about college affordability over the next decade.</p><p>HALL: Mark Kantrowitz publishes an top financial aid information web site. He says slim government budgets have slashed college and university funding, leading schools to have students pay a higher price. This year alone tuition at four-year public universities is up more than 8 percent from last year according to the College Board. The recession also has dealt a below to financial aid grants leaving students to foot more of the bill than ever before. For many it's a bigger burden than they can afford.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: We see this first and foremost with the lower and moderate income students. They're the canaries in the cage that keel over first.</p><p>HALL: Jane Wellman heads the Delta Cost Project, a non-profit tracking how colleges use their funds. She points to faculty benefits as one of the largest drivers of school spending.</p><p>JANE WELLMAN, EXECUTIVE DIR., DELTA COST PROJECT: We can't expect students to pay for all of this. We shouldn't have to.</p><p>HALL: She says many colleges are working to minimize tuition hikes. The school budgets aren't nimble enough to shift quickly.</p><p>WELLMAN: The structural problems of higher education finance have been growing for 20 years. But the depth of the recession, the 2008 recession and the slow recovery from it, no one expects this is going to turn around any time soon.</p><p>HALL: With prices rising, experts like Reyna Gobel say paying for college doesn't have to become a crisis because Federal student loans carry a variety of payment plans.</p><p>REYNA GOBEL, AUTHOR, \"GRADUATION DEBT\": Whatever you do, don't give up on it, these type of loans. Don't listen to its (ph) bears because you have so much power. You are the consumer. No matter how much money is in your pocket right now, you are the consumer and you have options. And don't let's anybody tell you different.</p><p>HALL: President Obama took up the student debt issue earlier this year by easing payback terms on some Federal student loans. But experts say ultimately making college more affordable must come from how states run higher education. Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Here is what we are watching for next week as 2012 gets under way. December economic data begins pouring in. We'll see auto sales, manufacturing and the number everybody is watching on Friday of next week - - December's employment report. Now Monday with the stock markets closed, we'll bring you an NBR special edition. Women and leadership, focus on Pamela Newman, one of the insurance industry's most powerful women.</p><p>While we await the auto industry's December results, strong sales help drive Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s recovery across the new milestone. 2011 sales of Ford brand cars and trucks topped two million units this week for the year, the first time since 2007 that any single auto brand has hit that mark. Ford's F-series pickup trucks were the top selling vehicle in the nation as they have been for the past three decades. As far as total sales, Ford remains number two U.S. auto maker behind General Motors (NYSE:GM).</p><p>President Obama put his request to increase the nation's debt limit on hold. The White House was expected today to ask for $1.2 trillion increase in the government's ability to borrow money. Congressional leaders though asked for a delay saying they would like time to address the measure when they were back in session next month. Lawmakers are not due back in Washington until mid-January. The government is currently within about $100 billion of reaching its borrowing limit.</p><p>Despite all the sound and fury this year over European debt problems, quantitative easing here in the U.S. and record corporate profits, 2011 comes to an end, where it pretty much began at least for the S&amp;P 500 stock index. Tonight's \"Market Monitor\" has one word to describe this year -- dividends. Sam Stovall is the chief investment strategist for Standard &amp; Poor's Capital IQ with us tonight from New York. Happy New Year to you Samuel.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: Happy New Year, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Not exactly a bull market, certainly not a bear market, it was a market where shareholders got paid to wait. Is that the best description?</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely. Not a bull, not a bear but a blah market and the investors who focused on quality as well as dividend yields were the ones who were rewarded.</p><p>HUDSON: Yeah and you can see that when you take a look at the top three stock sectors in the S&amp;P 500, utilities, consumer staples, health care, kind of defensive but also sectors that traditionally pay their shareholders. What went into that kind of stock performance this year?</p><p>STOVALL: I think basically the reason why you had the three best performing sectors post total returns above 13 percent each and not be cyclical sectors in nature is because they were substitutes for bonds. Investors were looking for nice payouts, dividend yields, some sort of a return that was better than money markets and also that would not present them with the potential of a bubble as some investors fear with the bond market. So they focused on these good total return sectors.</p><p>HUDSON: And at least for the utilities, a sector that really wasn't in the headlines much, not much news going on there and perhaps it benefited from that.</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely. You would have thought that telecom services group would have done better than it did because it does have the highest dividend yield of all 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500. But utilities beat out the telecom group, I think mainly as you said because of static demand and very high dividends.</p><p>HUDSON: Of course, in the telecom group, it was the big busted deal with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile to end the year. Meantime financials, banks were the weakest again. You know, it's tough to get market to move forward when the financials aren't moving forward, isn't it?</p><p>STOVALL: It's tough, certainly to get them moving forward for any long-term period. We were able to establish an all-time high back in 2007 when the financials were starting their nosedive. But obviously that advance did not last very long as we saw in 2008. So yes, we have the possibility for short-term advances in the market without the financials, but nothing that I think would be very long lasting.</p><p>HUDSON: So here we are again at the end of another year, Sam, you and I speaking pretty much where the S&amp;P 500 was a year ago when we were together. But corporate profits are at record levels, so what kind of valuation does that present investors as we begin a new year?</p><p>STOVALL: It presents investors with a very good valuation, actually a 10 percent discount to the median P/E since 1936. And history also says but does not guarantee that you would need to see the yield on the 10-year note rise above 7 percent in order for the P/E on the S&amp;P to be able to fall below 11. So we have very attractive P/E ratios and based on the yield on the 10-year note, not a good likelihood that we'll see single digits any time soon.</p><p>HUDSON: With that in mind, we'll take a look at the last year of trading for the S&amp;P 500 and despite all the ups and downs, we are pretty much where we began the year at and we're close to the middle of the range from the April high to the October low. So what is the outlook for the S&amp;P 500 for 2012?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, the outlook on a price basis is probably a very, very low double digit advance. Corporate profits are likely to advance by more than 8 percent according to the S&amp;P Capital IQ consensus. Valuations look fairly attractive, no likelihood of a recession in the U.S., in our opinion, unless we are dragged lower by Europe and the possibility of a hard landing in China. And from a technical perspective, our belief is that the market is sort of like a coiled spring, poised to move higher, certainly into the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>HUDSON: And of course that also brings up the third and fourth quarter of 2012, big election. Could that hold back any gains?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, it could hold back some gains. I think the fact that 2011 the third year of the president's term in office was such a lackluster year, historically it implies that we could end up with a blah 2012 as well.</p><p>HUDSON: We'll leave it there. Happy New Year to you, great to see you. It's our \"Market Monitor\" as we wind up the year, Sam Stovall with S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><p>Finally tonight, when the ball drops in Times Square, New York City tomorrow night, it will ring in more than just the New Year. It also rings in the new energy, independence and security Act. It's a mouth full but to mark the occasion, all 32,000 balls on the Times Square ball are energy efficient. The bill is designed to encourage new lighting technology like LED and halogen bulbs. It's aimed at cutting energy consumption and saving consumers money. Thanks to all of those new balls this year, the Times Square ball drop will use, get this, 88 percent less electricity than previous years.</p><p>That's it for us for this year and for tonight. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday December 30th, the last trading day of 2011. I'm Tom Hudson. Thanks for joining us. From all of us at NBR, have a happy and safe New Year. We'll see you back here in 2012.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>got the OK from the Senate today; he gets to keep his job. Tom as you know, there was plenty of drama and debate before the vote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: There sure was Susie and when the dust finally had settled on Capitol Hill, lawmakers did vote 70 to 30 to re-appoint <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>to another four years now as chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, the controversy over Bernanke`s policies and what they mean for jobs, inflation and the economy won`t go away. He`s still under pressure. As Darren Gersh reports, many politicians will be watching <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>now more closely than ever.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Ben Bernanke`s supporters consider him the indispensable man of the financial crisis. As <person><nameText>Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke </nameText></person>pumped more than $1 trillion into the banking system, hoping to prevent another great depression. Sometime this year <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>is expected to reverse course, raising interest rates and winding down many of the crisis programs he put in place. Rhode Island`s Jack Reed called that a delicate task and a good reason to give <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>a second term.</p><p>SEN. JACK REED, (D) RHODE ISLAND: We need someone that understands these programs and understands them not just theoretically, but literally from trial and error, understanding what worked, what didn`t work, what the consequences are.</p><p>GERSH: One consequence of waiting too long to take that money out of the banking system could be a burst of inflation. New Hampshire`s Judd Gregg said <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won`t let that happen.</p><p>SEN. JUDD GREGG, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE: As we all know, inflation is the cruelest tax of all. Because it devalues peoples savings and it undermines the productivity of a nation.</p><p>GERSH: Other conservatives argued Bernanke`s low interest rate policies created those very inflation risks. And Kentucky`s Jim Bunning reminded his colleagues of what he sees as the <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>Fed`s lasting legacy.</p><p>SEN. JIM BUNNING, (R) KENTUCKY: A vote for <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is a vote for bailouts. Chairman <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>has been in the middle of all the financial bailouts during the crisis.</p><p>GERSH: From the left, Democrats pushed the Fed to put Main Street ahead of Wall Street. And Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said it wasn`t just <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>who needed to change course.</p><p>SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, (D) RHODE ISLAND: The leaders of President Obama`s economic team must pivot from the necessary rescue of our major financial institutions to equally, if not more necessary, help to America`s families.</p><p>GERSH: But today`s confirmation vote was partly about reassuring investors on Wall Street. Some of Bernanke`s strongest supporters argued a no vote would undermine confidence just as the economy and financial markets are finding solid footing. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s take a look at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel for you. Tech stocks leading the way lower on Wall Street. Poor outlooks from Qualcomm and Motorola churned up new worries about the economy. At the close, there it is, the Dow Industrials down 115 points, the NASDAQ down 42 and the S&amp;P 500 off nearly 13. All three now are at new lows for the year.</p><p>Results from Microsoft may help set the tone for tomorrow`s trading. The software giant turning in strong fiscal second quarter results with earnings up 60 percent on strong demand for Windows 7. Meanwhile online, amazon.com, huge profits, up 71 percent on robust holiday sales. The company says it`s upbeat about its Kindle e-reader, even with Apple`s iPad launch. We`ll have more specifics on Amazon and Apple coming up in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Something different at Ford, the auto maker says it made money last year. In fact, it`s the first full year profit since 2005. Ford earned almost $3 billion last year, reversing a loss of more than $14 billion in 2008. CEO Alan Mulally expects the profit streak to continue over the next two years, at least before taxes. Driving those profits, sales of Ford`s popular Fusion cars and a turnaround in its finance business. Ford also hopes to take advantage of a competitor`s weakness and win over Toyota buyers. It`s offering $1,000 to customers trading in a late-model Toyota.</p><p>HUDSON: As for Toyota tonight, it is waiting for Federal safety regulators to sign off on the fix for its gas pedal problems. With the recall growing, the auto maker known for quality faces some tough questions. Jeffrey Liker is an engineering professor at the University of Michigan and author of the book \"The Toyota Way.\" Professor, welcome to NBR. Has Toyota lost its way with this six million vehicle recall?</p><p>JEFFREY LIKER, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: I don`t think so. Six million sounds like six million problems, but it`s actually two problems that they`ve been able to identify, a problem with carpets when they are loose and a problem with sticky pedals after a few years that has happened in a relatively small number of cars. So I don`t think you could say that. n my experience looking, visiting their plants, visiting their engineering offices, their quality is actually better than ever. For example, 10 JD Power awards for initial quality, the most of any auto maker last year.</p><p>HUDSON: But this is certainly front and center in most consumers and investors` minds. Is the recall and how Toyota has been handling it here do you think any indication that the culture of quality perhaps is changing on the edges?</p><p>LIKER: I think it`s certainly an indication about the interest of the press and the Internet and how quickly news gets blown up so that you forget it is the pedal and it`s carpet and it becomes the whole company. So I think that gives a very unrealistic impression of what is happening within Toyota.</p><p>HUDSON: But certainly isn`t this representative of what Toyota does, which is build cars and perhaps there is nothing more central to a car other than its gas pedal?</p><p>LIKER: The gas pedal works in almost every case but after a few years it gets sticky. And it feels sort of awkward. So that also happens in every other car in the world in certain cases. It is not unique to Toyota, but they did find that there is a particular material and a little piece of metal that interacts with moisture and one supplier used that particular material and that is generating all the millions of recalls. It is not certainly indicative of quality in the company. It is not really evidence that...</p><p>HUDSON: You`ve studied Toyota for years. You visited plants both in the United States and globally. How prepared do you think the company is to deal with this size of recall, both from the perspective of customers and drivers but as well as shareholders.</p><p>LIKER: Well, actually they are probably more prepared than before the recession. One of the things Toyota did in the recession was to keep all their people employed, train them, solve quality problems in the plant. They launched new vehicles. They move vehicles from plant to plant so they are probably more flexible and more prepared than they have ever been before.</p><p>HUDSON: In 2001 as you know, Toyota set out to become the world`s biggest auto maker. It did succeed. Do you think that appetite for growth played any role in this recall at all? Those questions are being asked now, I imagine.</p><p>LIKER: I know those questions are being asked, again, I think by uninformed people that aren`t realizing this is a supplier and a pedal. And it`s a carpet that if it is not fastened down causes a problem. I don`t know what that tells you about the company, when a company is consistently winning quality awards from JD Power, consistently at the tops of consumer reports.</p><p>HUDSON: With all those --</p><p>LIKER: The measures are getting better every year.</p><p>HUDSON: So with all those awards recognized, why do you think Toyota took the step to actually issue a massive recall as opposed to just deal with these problems as they came in?</p><p>LIKER: If you have a pedal, yeah, if you have a pedal that can stick and you meet with NTSA and you decide a recall --</p><p>HUDSON: NTSA is the National Transportation Safety Administration.</p><p>LIKER: The national, yes, exactly and they meet and they don`t know which of those other cars has that problem. They have no way of knowing. It could be one, it could be 10, it could be 50. So they obviously have to take action. And that`s also the responsible thing to do. But that doesn`t tell you anything about what is going on in their Georgetown, Kentucky plant or the Indiana plant or their engineering office. It is still this one problem that the pedal in one plant that made, in a supplier plant and the designed decision was made 10 years ago.</p><p>HUDSON: We have to leave it there. We appreciate you answering questions.</p><p>LIKER: You have to go back 10 years.</p><p>HUDSON: There we go. Jeffrey Liker along with us, University of Michigan professor, author of \"The Toyota Way.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead, how Toyota is responding to customers on the web. And when it comes to social networking, what your company needs to know about crisis management.</p><p>HUDSON: Continuing just a bit with Toyota, it is in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" With the recall expanding, the company that makes the gas pedal assemblies the professor referred to at the heart of this problem says don`t blame it. That didn`t necessarily help the shares of the company. CTS (CTS), we talked about it last night, again here, after staging a bit of a recovery on Wednesday, today another tough day as you can see, usually about 100,000 CTS shares trade hands. Today more than a million and a half traded and the company said Toyota (TM) is responsible for the bad pedal design, not it. Meantime, CTS says it`s adding extra shifts at three of its factories to make replacement parts. And the company says none of the pedals it sends to Toyota are used by other auto makers. Competing supplier Denso already is Toyota`s biggest parts maker. A spokeswoman tells NBR their Toyota pedals are made in Japan and that it will support Toyota as much as possible, but she would not be specific.</p><p>Earlier we did mention today`s big tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN). Let`s take a look at some of the details here. To get the $0.74 a share profit last quarter that you see from Microsoft, it added in deferred revenue. This all relates to the October release of its Windows 7. It sold the software to computer makers two quarters ago before the software was officially released. Those sales are now included in this quarterly report. After hours, Microsoft stock up about $0.40 after dropping almost 2 percent on double normal volume.</p><p>Amazon shares certainly catching a bit after the close, up $3 at one point, hitting close to $130 a share, up almost $3 ahead of these results. Santa very kind to amazon.com, a big blow away quarter here. It`s not expected to stop. The company predicts sales to be at least 32 percent higher this quarter. Barclays thinks that Amazon`s Kindle will remain hot even with the new iPad from Apple.</p><p>Some of the big movers in the world of mobile phones are moving in different directions. On the downside, Qualcomm (QCOM) after lowering its sales forecast, the stock dropping 14 percent, very active, almost 10 times volume. Motorola (MOT) stock meantime hitting fresh six month lows tonight. The fourth quarter profit not enough to impress buyers because a warning came. Fewer devices from Motorola will be shipped this quarter. The biggest competitor, Nokia (NOK) saw its stock hit three-month highs on six times normal volume. Better than expected results and a bigger slice of the cell phone market helping push shares of Nokia higher.</p><p>Let`s catching up on a couple or rather a trio of the Dow components that did report results today, pushing the market around. Pampers maker P&amp;G, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) did its best to put some green on the board. It was the biggest percentage gainer today, up almost 2 percent for the Dow. Profits beat the Street, thanks in part to price cuts as well as higher priced new products.</p><p>Post-it note maker 3M (MMM) was able to show growing profits, pushed up its prediction for the year, not enough though for the stock. Take a look. The shares wane on the index slipping to an early December low.</p><p>Let me tell you quickly about AT&amp;T (T) shares, down by only $0.06 in the day, this after matching estimates thanks to its wireless business certainly with Apple`s iPhone.</p><p>And a former Dow component turned in a big day of buying. Eastman Kodak (EK), take a look at the stock, 54 million shares, nine times average and at a six-month high, close to a six-month high, its highest price at least since September. Now the Dow Industrials only 120 points above 10,000. Investors here unimpressed with earnings and earnings will continue to be in the \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: More on the Toyota recall, as we know, it`s a big story for the news media. But it`s also a big topic of discussion on social media. Toyota has an active social networking presence on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. It`s answering customer concerns on those sites and on its own web page it has a list of frequently asked questions and answers. This kind of proactive response is exactly what the doctor ordered, according to Scott Gurvey`s guide to social networking. Scott wraps up his series tonight with a look at how businesses should approach these new media platforms.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you think the people around you spend a lot of time on social networking sites, you are probably right. And if you are a business hoping to expand through social networking, digital strategy guru Stephanie Agresta says you should plan on making it a part of your regular routine.</p><p>STEPHANIE AGRESTA, VP DIGITAL STRATEGY, PORTER NOVELLI: As a business, if you`re making the investment to be there, then you need to be there consistently. It`s not something you can jump into, post, let days go by and then post again. Your customers need to know that you are really committed to the medium.</p><p>GURVEY: So, our first take-away tonight is devote time. Nicole Romagnoll spends an hour each day maintaining her pet care company`s Facebook page.</p><p>NICOLE ROMAGNOLL, FETCH! PET CARE OF STATEN ISLAND: It`s not work for me. It`s fun. You`re socializing. It`s exciting when you post a picture of a new client and then you get people commenting underneath about how cute. I look forward to seeing that stuff so when I want a break from my day, I`ll go on to my fan page.</p><p>GURVEY: One thing to be aware of with social networking is a multiplier effect. Columbia Professor Sree Sreenivasan says it`s both a blessing and a curse.</p><p>SREE SREENIVASAN, DIGITAL MEDIA PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIV.: The power of twitter is really in the re-tweet. As in, somebody takes the post you made and then re-tweets it and sends it out. So instead of someone just saying something at the water cooler they`re saying it at the digital water cooler which has this effect of this echo that can make things that are not true seem true and things that are true, they can amplify it in a good way or in a bad way.</p><p>GURVEY: Lev Ekster says knowing how quickly a negative comment about his cupcake company can spread keeps everyone on their toes.</p><p>LEV EKSTER, FOUNDER, CUPCAKESTOP.COM: All it takes is one dissatisfied customer to send a tweet about you to really hurt the business, so that`s why we try so hard. And we know we have this immense exposure on Twitter now with 9,000 people following us, so it`s important to maintain quality and make sure all those 9,000 people are pleased with you.</p><p>GURVEY: Which brings us to our final take-away. Don`t panic. If you get a complaint, social media adviser Jennifer Jacobson says, meet it head on.</p><p>JENNIFER JACOBSON, AUTHOR &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT: It`s probably not that they just don`t like you and want to say bad things about your business. They probably have a legitimate concern. So step back. Sort of take the emotion out of it and really look at what it is they`re saying and address it honestly. Because if you can have that kind of conversation even over Twitter, your other customers that are following you are going to see that and they`re going to see the tact and the skill and the sincerity with which you addressed that person`s complaint or issue. And hopefully they will respect that.</p><p>GURVEY: Our guide to social networking doesn`t end here. There`s more on our web site, NBR on pbs.org and we hope the next chapter in the guide will be written by you. Add your comments and tips for businesses going online to our blog and we`ll keep the dialogue going. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow. We`ll see earnings from Chevron, Fortune Brands, Honeywell and Mattel. And we also get our first look at how the economy did in the final three months of last year. The prediction? Up over 4 percent. And, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest says the economic recovery is the real deal. He`s John Dorfman, chairman of Thunderstorm Capital looking for double digit growth in the year 2010.</p><p>GHARIB: Case dismissed against Broadcom founder Henry Nicholas. A Federal judge today threw out drug charges and two civil cases against the former CEO. He had faced the possibility of decades in prison. Last month, Nicholas was cleared of insider trading charges after the judge accused prosecutors of misconduct. Lawyers for the SEC still plan to re- file a lawsuit related to those charges.</p><p>HUDSON: If you`re an at-risk homeowner and want help modifying your mortgage from the government, you`ll have to prove your income up front with recent pay stubs and tax returns. Previously, borrowers could provide their income verbally and supply documentation later. That caused problems because many homeowners never got around to doing it. Out of 900,000 trial modifications, only 7 percent or 66,000 have become permanent. The paperwork change begins June 1st.</p><p>GHARIB: As we said, <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>will be running the Fed for the next four years. But he might not have as much free reign this time around. Some members of Congress want to audit the Fed`s activities. Our commentator tonight thinks that`s a bad idea and he ought to know. He`s Alan Blinder, former vice chair of the Fed and professor of economics at Princeton.</p><p>ALAN BLINDER, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Do you ever get the feeling that this country is over-lawyered? Well, here`s another example. Ron Paul, the libertarian congressman who wants to abolish the Federal Reserve, has long promoted a first step in that direction. The so- called Paul bill would subject the Fed`s monetary policy decisions to GAO audits. Like most economists, I find the idea, well, appalling. But I breathed a sigh of relief when a modified version was appended to the House`s financial reform bill late last year. The Paul-Grayson amendment added what I thought was an important clause. Let me read it to you. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as interference in or dictation of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve System by the Congress or the GAO.</p><p>That sounds like a strong affirmation of the Fed`s independence, right? I certainly read it that way and so did my students. Then I talked to a lawyer. So put on your lawyers glasses and read it again Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as interference and so on. Read literally, the sentence does not instruct Congress to keep its nose out of monetary policy. Instead, it asserts that the proposed law does not interfere with monetary policy even if you think it does. Orwell`s big brother would have been proud. He gave us war is peace, freedom is slavery. Now the House thought police give us interference is not interference. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, could we please fix this? I`m Alan Blinder.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally tonight, when it comes to music, what`s old is now new. Vinyl records once considered obsolete are making a big comeback. Jeff Yastine reports tonight, that`s music to the ears of many fans.</p><p>JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A busy afternoon at Sweat Records. Amid the re-stocking of vegetarian jerky treats, you`ll find other hints of what`s really for sale here. Record adapters? What are those? And along one side of the store, a mother load of vinyl. These are new pressings, not used records. Lauren Reskin presides over this vinyl paradise.</p><p>LAUREN RESKIN OWNER, SWEAT RECORDS: Most people are really surprised when they come in, you guys sell records? We get that from older folks are most surprised and then young kids come in and they`re just like ooh vinyl. It`s neat that the perspectives are kind of changing on that.</p><p>YASTINE: Some of the albums are iconic, reissues of classic Beatles, Beach Boys, Miles Davis. But right alongside those, you`ll find new releases, from bands you`ve likely never heard of, yet. Reskin says vinyl and digital can peacefully co-exist. In many cases, if you buy a vinyl record, you get the digital download for free. And for the iPod generation, those records come with a new appreciation of cover art.</p><p>RESKIN: Like this, on CD it looks like a big jumble of just stuff. But when you blow it up this big, there`s a street scene and some cool graphics and this one comes with a 32-page booklet, liner notes and a comic book and graffiti and downloads. That`s a lot more bang for your buck than just a normal CD.</p><p>YASTINE: Vinyl record sales have soared, nearly tripling to 2.5 million records in the last three years. Not bad for a format long declared dead. And here is one of the few places where vinyl records are still made. Linford Ellis is one of the few engineers who still knows how to turn raw vinyl into music. There are only a dozen pressing plants still operating in the U.S., half of what existed 20 years ago.</p><p>LINFORD ELLIS, PLANT MANAGER, ALPHA MUSIC MFG.: And most of those people now, they can`t do this job anymore. They`ve forgotten what they`ve learned, so the few people around, the few pressing plants that are around, are still going. We`re like gold dust.</p><p>YASTINE: To give you a sense of how much the vinyl record business has taken off, this machine pumps out about 800 vinyl records a day. This is actually a 45 but with a small hole. But now they have a second machine, this one here. It`s also pumping out 800 records as well. Business is so good these days that Alpha is bringing in a third, a fourth and a fifth machine. But these machines are so old that they`re having to scrounge for parts to get them up and running again. That`s a good problem to have, if you`re Jeffrey Collins, CEO of Alpha Music Manufacturing. He`s as surprised as anyone about vinyl`s resurgence.</p><p>JEFFREY COLLINS, CEO, ALPHA MUSIC MFG.: It`s exciting. I didn`t think that vinyl was going to continue and last as long as it did. I don`t think vinyl will ever die.</p><p>YASTINE: Not everyone agrees. Some think it`s a fad or a love of all things retro. Then again, back at Sweat Records...</p><p>RESKIN: In the first year we were around, we expanded our vinyl immensely. And in that first year is when I realized we`re going to sell more vinyl than I anticipated.</p><p>YASTINE: That was five years ago. And vinyl, like Reskin`s store is still going strong. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami.</p><p>HUDSON: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, January 28. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: See you tomorrow Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night everyone, hope to see all of you again tomorrow night right here.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Tom Hudson.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Hi, Tom. It's great to be here. Good evening everyone. I'm Susie Gharib.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) says it will bring some computer production back to the United States, but why has the stock dropped more than 20 percent this fall?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: The fiscal cliff moves to the kitchen table. President Obama visits a Virginia family and tells them how the cliff could impact their budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: And a very special conversation tonight with Paul Kangas. NBR's founding co-anchor joins us to answer your questions.</p><p>GHARIB: We have that and more right here tonight on NBR.</p><p>HUDSON: Millions and millions of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) brag they were designed in California, but admit they were built in China. Next year, some of those Macs will be built in the U.S. too. CEO Tim Cook made the pledge to return to U.S. manufacturing in two media interviews. It marks a return for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which transferred most of its technology building to Asia more than a decade ago. It's more of a symbolic move though than a big financial investment. After all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) spends more than $9 billion a year on manufacturing and the U.S. commitment is expected to be about $100 million or 1 percent of its global factory investments. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't say where in the U.S. the line of Mac computers would be built or how many jobs might be included. Now the return of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to U.S. manufacturing comes as shareholders have experienced a very rocky ride in the past few months. The stock is down 22 percent from its all-time high in September. Suzanne Pratt reports.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A peak inside this Manhattan Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and it looks like everything is a- OK, plenty of customers, plenty of purchases. So why has the shine come off Apple's shares? Within a word, actually two, profit-taking.</p><p>BRIAN COSTELLO, SR. EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: I think the biggest reason for the selling going back to when it was priced $700 in September has been pure profit-taking. If you look from the beginning of the year to September, the stock was up 74 percent. So I think you had some natural profit-taking.</p><p>PRATT: But this isn't ordinary year-end selling by institutions looking to record nice numbers. This supposedly is fiscal cliff related selling as shareholders worry that capital gains tax rates will be higher next year. Still, financial planner Sharon Appelman says selling stock solely for tax reasons isn't the best idea.</p><p>SHARON APPELMAN, FINANCIAL PLANNER: I definitely think it's a legitimate concern and can be an opportunity. And I would say if somebody was interested in reducing a position anyway, that can certainly be a great time to do it. You know, why pay higher taxes in a few months time when you can pay a lower tax now?</p><p>PRATT: And some analysts say, before unloading the shares, consider that fundamentals for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven't really changed. Sure, revenue growth may slow and there are worries the tech giant will have trouble fending off competition from increasingly popular Android products. But to some analysts, the shares look especially cheap today, especially considering their move south since the September high.</p><p>COSTELLO: We think the smart phone trend is still in the early to middle innings. It is not in the late innings yet. So we think, to the extent that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can maintain its share of the premium smart phone market, we think they'll do quite well. You throw the iPad on top of it and how it's cannibalizing PCs, that's another great growth driver.</p><p>PRATT: It is worth noting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are still up more than 30 percent this year. Even with more tax-related selling, it will be tough to erase all of those profits in the next few weeks. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose more than 1.5 percent today and that gave a boost to stocks. Also better than expected job news encouraged investors. New claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 in the week ending December 1 to a lower than expected 370,000 requests and that could be a good sign for the November jobs report that comes out tomorrow and we'll have more on that in just a moment. Separately, American companies announced 57,000 job cuts in November. That's accord to employment firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, says that's 20 percent higher from October's levels. On Wall Street today, the Dow rose 39 points, the NASDAQ added 15, the S&amp;P up nearly five.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I'm Erika Miller in New York. Coming up tonight, we'll talk to the CEO of kitchen store Sur la Table and get his outlook for holiday sales.</p><p>HUDSON: Lots of theatrics today, but few visible signs of progress in Washington towards a fix for the fiscal cliff. The only hopeful sign is that Republicans and Democrats are talking privately again. There remains a lot of work ahead certainly including what to do about the nation's debt limit. Washington will hit its borrowing limit early next year. Darren Gersh has the latest.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Sitting around the kitchen table with a middle class family in Virginia, the president once again pressed for Congress to avoid the fiscal cliff.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If this family has a couple of thousand dollars less to spend, that translates into $200 billion of less consumer spending next year. And that's bad for businesses, large and small.</p><p>GERSH: Behind the scenes, the two sides are talking again. But there was no progress in public. Senators today fought over the debt limit and ended up deadlocked over a bill to allow the president to automatically increase borrowing.</p><p>SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, MINORITY LEADER: He's shown what he is really after is assuming unprecedented power to spend taxpayer dollars without any limit at all.</p><p>GERSH: If the debt limit isn't raised, the country can't pay for the spending Congress has already approved. And economists say the nation pays a high price for this kind of brinkmanship.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Business people aren't going to engage unless they have clarity with respect to this thing.</p><p>GERSH: But few insiders expect to find much clarity from Washington in the coming weeks. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Investors will be searching for more clarity on those fiscal cliff talks and they will also be studying tomorrow's important jobs report. But Josh Feinman says the November numbers won't give an accurate picture of the labor market. He's chief economist at DB Advisors. Hi, Josh, so you're talking about distortions in that report. Tell us more.</p><p>JOSH FEINMAN, CHIEF GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DB ADVISORS: Yes, hi, Susie. I think that the hurricane Sandy may distort the numbers. We've seen it in some of the other high frequency data in the last couple of weeks. Keep in mind tomorrow's labor market report will report on a snapshot of the labor market that was taken in the middle of last month. And that's when the hurricane and its aftermath were having their effects.</p><p>GHARIB: So the consensus numbers from a survey of economists, they're expecting American businesses added 110,000 jobs to their payroll. Their unemployment rate staying around 7.9 percent. Does that sit right with you? Is that what you are seeing?</p><p>FEINMAN: Probably somewhere around that, maybe a little less. One of the problems is it is hard to gauge exactly what the impact of the storm will have. We know it's transitory but it's hard to say exactly how much numerically it will subtract. The thing is, if the number comes in lower than that I think a lot of people will say oh, it was probably the effect of the hurricane and they'll wait until the following month to see what kind of a rebound we get.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's talk a little bit about what we can expect from the job market going forward. I don't know if you saw Alan Blinder's op/ed piece in \"The Wall Street Journal.\" The former Fed governor saying that if we go over the fiscal cliff, the unemployment rate will jump to 11 percent because we'll be a recession and customarily when you are in a recession, the unemployment rate goes up 3 percentage points. Does that sound right to you? And if that is the case, what does this mean for consumers and for businesses?</p><p>FEINMAN: Well, it would be seriously bad news. But I think what is important is not just whether we go over the cliff but how long we stay over there. I mean if it turns out that they need a couple more days to hammer out an accord, I don't think that's going to have a big lasting effect. But if we go over the cliff and all those spending cuts and all those tax hikes go into effect and stay in effect for the whole year, then you would be talking about a very high likelihood of a recession and a rising unemployment, a substantial rise, we can quibble about how much. But it would be seriously bad news for consumers and businesses.</p><p>GHARIB: As you know Josh, the Federal Reserve is going to be meeting next week on Tuesday. Certainly this is all going to be a topic around the table. Is there a role for the Federal Reserve in this fiscal cliff back and forth?</p><p>FEINMAN: There really isn't a direct role that they can play. This is fiscal policy. The Fed does not make fiscal policy. It makes monetary policy. I think Chairman Bernanke and others have been very clear to stay out of the battle that has to be resolved by the Congress and the administration. Look, I think at the end of the day, they are going to reach some sort of an accord to avert the most draconian aspects of the fiscal cliff. Maybe the 11th, or 12th or maybe even the 13th hour, but I think they are going to reach that because I think they recognize that the consequences of not doing so are so severe.</p><p>GHARIB: But let's face it, that even if there is a deal, we're talking about an economy that is going to have to deal with people having higher taxes and dealing with spending cuts. What are you projecting for 2013 real quickly? We have a little time left, for economic growth and unemployment.</p><p>FEINMAN: Sure. I think the economy is going to be facing some fiscal drag from the Federal side, but if it is phased in slowly, it's not really austere and abrupt, I think it can handle it because I think the private sector is healing and I'm looking for some improvement in growth by the second half of the year provided that we don't hit a landmine here on the fiscal side.</p><p>GHARIB: All right, Josh, thanks so much, great talking with you. We've been speaking with Josh Feinman of DB Advisors.</p><p>HUDSON: Nearly a month and a half after super storm Sandy wreaked havoc along the New Jersey shore, President Obama met today with Governor Chris Christie at the White House. The topic was Federal aid for storm recovery. The president is expected to ask Congress for about $50 billion in additional emergency help. Ruben Ramirez is in Seaside Heights, New Jersey tonight, where business owners are still trying to recover. Ruben?</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Tom. Yes, nearly six weeks after super storm Sandy devastated this barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, there's still a curfew in place. A lot of the traffic you see behind me is a lot of those longtime residents from the island and business owners who have been going back day in and day out, trying to recover and repair whatever's left. Some of those business owners we had a chance to speak to today. They say they'll reopen come next summer. You've been in business 33 years. Have you seen this sort of devastation before?</p><p>SAM HAMMER, OWNER, CRAB's CLAW INN: No, nothing like this. We -- that's the reason we stayed because they were explaining that there was going to be a terrible storm. But we, of this magnitude we had no idea. This is just like -- hard to believe.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Here we are almost six weeks after the storm hit. How soon until you get the business open and up and running again?</p><p>JIM BOEKHOLT, OWNER, BEN FRANKLIN: There's a few problems -- electrical and structural. But hopefully in the next maybe two months, we might be able to get open again. But definitely we will be open for the summer season.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Tom, some of those small business owners we spoke to say they didn't have flood insurance because they say the summer season is short here and the insurance is just too expensive. Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Thanks, Ruben. You'll have more from Seaside Heights tomorrow. We have more on how insurance companies manage risk when it comes to natural disasters Learn about the modeling on our web site, nbr.com. Look for that nbr-u tab.</p><p>GHARIB: Americans were feeling a little richer recently, thanks to gains in real estate and the stock market. The Federal Reserve said today that household net worth rose to nearly $65 trillion between July and September. That's up nearly $2 trillion from the previous quarter. Net worth is total assets, like homes and stock portfolios, minus liabilities like mortgages and credit card debt. That wealth effect could make consumers feel more comfortable about shopping this holiday season. There are still 20 days to go before Christmas and the rush is on. Toys are always popular items of course, but there's one category that's expected to do even better and no, it's not electronics. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>MILLER: For many families, the holidays are all about the home. Few retailers know that better than Sur la Table, a 104-store chain selling kitchenware and tabletop items. CEO Jack Schwefel says sales are off to a strong start, and credits changing American values.</p><p>JACK SCHWEFEL, PRES &amp; CEO, SUR LA TABLE: I think Americans are realizing the importance of the family meal, where people get together. No matter how crazy the day is, you can have that moment every day where it becomes the most important moment of the day and you share it with the people you love the most.</p><p>MILLER: Unlike many retailers, Sur la Table says it hasn't had a problem with showrooming this holiday season. That's when people come in to browse, but purchase cheaper versions online. Part of the reason is that 40 percent of the store's products are exclusive.</p><p>SCHWEFEL: One of the things that we are most proud of is the fact that we still import more product from Europe than we do from China. So you are talking about artisan product, product that has a story to it, that's special. You just don't see that in retailing in America.</p><p>MILLER: Stores like Sur la Table are expected to be one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster holiday season. In fact, some analyst think home goods will be hotter than toys this holiday year. IBM projects home goods will see the strongest sales growth this year, up over 6 percent. That's far more than toys and electronics.</p><p>JILL PUFERI, GLOBAL RETAIL LEADER, IBM: You might ask yourself, why home, right? And we think home is up because of a lot of things -- things like the changing demographic of the home itself. There's one stat that says 41 percent of those between 25 and 29 are living back at home.</p><p>MILLER: But there also a second reason.</p><p>PUFERI: We think that this holiday people are buying what they need versus what they want.</p><p>MILLER: Which had me wondering what's on Jack Schwefel's wish list this holiday season. It wasn't this $5,500 coffee maker.</p><p>SCHWEFEL: There are some new knives in our store that I'm actually pretty excited about, so probably those. They're cutting board material is actually used in the handle of the knives.</p><p>MILLER: And there's no denying it will look good sur la table during the holidays. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: I know what's on your wish list. A lot of people are buying new housewares. You love cooking.</p><p>HUDSON: I do love cooking. Listen I think is great that the house goods category is seeing some good growth here. It says that there is a lot of confidence in the housing market number one. But let's face it, just because it's home goods doesn't mean it's cheap Susie or inexpensive. A $5500 coffeemaker, some of these home appliance blenders can be $500.</p><p>GHARIB: If you are looking for discounts Tom, now there is green Monday. We have black Friday. We've had cyber Monday. Green Monday is the second Monday in December and that's when there is a lots of discounts online. So it will be good for consumers.</p><p>HUDSON: We've been talking a lot about the fiscal cliff, but I think there is the holiday cliff almost every year which is that game of chicken between stores. Are they going have to discount as we get closer to the holidays or are consumers, shoppers going to spend the money that the stores are asking for right now? Clearly another indication that stores perhaps may be getting a little bit nervous now.</p><p>GHARIB: Speaking of green, there was some green on Wall Street today.</p><p>HUDSON: There was some buying on Wall Street. Let's take a look at our \"Market Focus\" here Susie and we saw some better than expected data on first-time unemployment claims leading to a bit of a choppy start for the S&amp;P 500. After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) went positive in the 10:00 a.m. Eastern time hour, so did the index. Tech stocks turned solidly higher, so did the market, finishing up a third of a percent. Trading volume still moderate, 616 million shares on the big board, just over 1.7 trading on the NASDAQ.</p><p>It was the tech sector that led the way, up 0.8 of a percent. Consumer discretionary sector added 0.6 of 1 percent on the session. Now the big tech names in the Dow industrials weren't left out in the rally. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had the biggest percentage gains of the Dow 30 stocks. Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) up 1.6 percent. The CEO said the company could manufacture semiconductors for other chip makers quote, for the right types of products, end quote. So, queue the rumors today that hint about maybe Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) possibly making chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>How about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems moving up 1.4 percent. The move takes Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to its highest price since September. The top tech sector stock was Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM). It helps speed up and manage online content and traffic. A new partnership announced today with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) led to the rally. Shares jumping 10 percent on heavy volume. Analysts say the deal turns AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) from a competitor to Akamai's customer, eliminating rival business for Akamai.</p><p>On the consumer side, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) red hot. The company said it will pay more taxes in Britain in the next two years. Yesterday, it also announced plans to open at least 1,500 new stores in the U.S. over the next five years. Shares of SBUX jumping 5.7 percent. Volume tripled today with the stock closing tonight at five-month highs.</p><p>How about tax prep giant H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB)? It sits at a new 52- week high tonight. It lost less money than feared last quarter. That was seen as good news. H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) has been cutting costs to focus on its core tax preparation business, especially drilling down to the digital tax prep business.</p><p>Even satellite radio operator Sirius/XM radio can't resist returning some cash to shareholders this season. It announced a one-time dividend of a nickel per share and a $2 billion stock buyback plan. Sirius shares are consistently among the most actively traded issues on the NASDAQ. Volume was very heavy as you'd expect today. The stock didn't move a whole lot though, up just $0.02. But there was a bigger stock move in Liberty Media Capital. Why Liberty Media? Well, it's the biggest shareholder of Sirius/XM stock. It stands to get $160 million thanks to the special dividend.</p><p>Online social gaming company Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has struggled to repeat the success of its Farmville game. It's going after a gaming license now in Nevada. Don't look it on the strip though. It wants customers to use real money, bet real money on Internet poker. Shares rallying 7.1 percent, volume doubled. Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has lost more than 70 percent of its value since becoming a publicly traded company.</p><p>All of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were higher with the emerging markets fund up the most, up 0.8 of a percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: And also with some market news, one of the hedge funds embroiled in the FBI's crackdown on insider trading is closing its doors. Diamondback Capital Management is shutting down and that's after clients pulled more than half a billion dollars from the fund. Federal agents raided the Connecticut firm two years ago as part of a nation-wide sweep that resulted in the arrest of one of the firm's former portfolio managers on insider trading charges. Since then, Diamondback's assets have dwindled to just over $1.5 billion, down from $5 billion.</p><p>GHARIB: Our viewers have been waiting and he's finally here. Paul Kangas, NBR co-founding anchor. Welcome home, it's so nice to have you back here.</p><p>PAUL KANGAS, NBR CO-FOUNDING ANCHOR: Well, it is like home and it's great to hear that I'm still welcome.</p><p>GHARIB: Actually, speaking of welcome. We got -- Tom and I got so many viewer questions for you and comments saying that they want to hear from the Walter Cronkite of financial news. A little bit of your wisdom in these confusing time, right, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely there is so much going on in the market and you've seen so much market cycles. We got a lot to talk about, but what we have got to ask ,what do you make of the stock market today?</p><p>KANGAS: It's sort of a stop and go affair. We get good news one day, better building permits and building news and on that front. And inflation is down a little bit. And then the next day it's all countered by new uprisings in Egypt and one thing or another. So the market tries to step higher and is countered by bad news. So stop and go all the way.</p><p>HUDSON: We got a great question from Eric P. Edson. You saw the Dow Industrials move from 1,000 to over 10,000 in your career. He asks, will the Dow Jones see 8,000 or 18,000 first?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, there's not that much volatility but it could see both in the same year. But I intend, I'm actually a little on the bullish bias because corporations continue to make money and the American people are basically optimistic. And a lot of stocks are under priced, particularly blue chips even though the Dow Industrial Average has more than doubled since 2009. But there's a reason for that and that's good earnings and that's good dividends.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, there's a lot of questions about if that is going to continue. And one of our viewers has a question for you about the fiscal cliff. You know all about the back and forth and the drama about the fiscal cliff and Delores Kile wants your thoughts on where do you stand on this whole fiscal cliff? How can it play out?</p><p>KANGAS: Congress better get off its duff and do something. And I think that finally the pressure is going to be enough (ph). But they always do it right to the last, you know, minute. But I think it's got to happen or they're going to be ousted from their hallowed political seats.</p><p>HUDSON: You could argue in the three years you've been away from the NBR anchor desk Congress hasn't done a whole heck of a lot to address the fiscal situation.</p><p>KANGAS: No it's just ridiculous. I mean these are our elected representatives and they have got to pay a little more attention to those that got them in the office. And they're arguing amongst themselves without much care about the people they represent.</p><p>HUDSON: A lot of those folks are retirees, we do have a question about retirement from Anita asking what is the investing or financial planning lesson Paul uses most during retirement?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, the number one is hope I can live my life to the last and still have enough capital to keep me going. And a lot of investors are running up against the same thing. They're running out of capital because yields are so low in the bond market; money markets are yielding practically nothing. So they have to chip into their base capital and that's hurtful. So what I am doing is looking for blue chip stocks with decent dividends.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of people are wondering that in this climate, what do you think is going to be the new investment opportunity available to all of us in 2013? That's a question from Fay.</p><p>KANGAS: New investment opportunity.</p><p>GHARIB: What is your prediction?</p><p>KANGAS: They'll come up with something new just like ETF exchange- traded funds were relatively new a few years ago and now have gained such popularity it is almost, it's staggering how much money has gone into ETFs.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned how volatility could have the Dow see 8,000 and 18,000, maybe in the same year. Frank sent us a tweet on Twitter asking individual investors are afraid of the markets. What needs to be done to gain their confidence?</p><p>KANGAS: Less regulation. I think that investors are afraid that they make an investment and something comes along, the rules change from what got them into the investment in the first place. Well you can't change, you know, canoes in the middle of a stream.</p><p>GHARIB: On this whole subject of investor confidence, we do have a question from Billy who says what's the greatest changes that you've seen in the market today? You've had some perspective three years being away from it on a day-to-day basis. What do you see as the biggest change?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, Billy, I'll tell you that the computer is a wonderful thing, but it's not the greatest thing for investing. And for investors who don't have a high speed capability and have large box of stock at their arm's length. I think that that is -- it's taken away the idea that long- term, long-term investing is a good thing. I think that's one of the changes that I don't like. Too much computer meddling.</p><p>HUDSON: Well, Paul, as much as the markets have changed, you haven't. It's great to see and hear from you again. Susie, we have to say good night but I think it's only proper to ask Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: I'm Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Oil traders in New York breathe a sigh of relief as OPEC decides not to tinker with production levels-we take a look at what this means for the oil markets. Good evening, everyone. I'm Susie Gharib in New York City.<br/>\u00a0<br/> JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And I'm Jeff Yastine. Paul Kangas is on assignment. Positive news from two big tech names gives Wall Street a boost. The Dow gains 114 points; the NASDAQ climbs 77. Then-this man takes charge of one of the most powerful panels in the U.S. Senate: we sit down with Paul Sarbanes, new chairman of the Banking Committee.</p><p>GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. A volatile day in the oil pits today. OPEC ministers decided today at a meeting in Vienna not to increase oil supplies, despite Iraq's move to halt production. Oil prices notched higher in reaction. As Suzanne Pratt reports, oil prices may be stable now-but there are still questions about supply.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Just one day after Iraq stunned world oil markets by suspending crude exports, OPEC fired back. The cartel opting to leave its oil output unchanged, at least for now. The decision came after OPEC members held a formal meeting today in Vienna, and decided to meet again next month to review market conditions.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Although oil trading here in New York was volatile all day, prices ultimately ended about where they started. Oil for July delivery at the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $0.11 to close at $28.24 a barrel.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SCOTT HESS, OIL TRADER, G&amp;H COMMODITIES: Yeah-the markets are very stable because of that news. Basically the markets were looking for a possible increase in output to compensate for the Iraqis cutting back on their production-total production cutback. So the markets are stable, and probably may work higher.<br/>\u00a0<br/> PRATT: But experts say, don't expect oil prices to work too much higher, as OPEC is happy with oil trading in a range slightly below $30 a barrel. And OPEC made it quite clear today that if prices warrant, it would decide to pump more oil when it meets again on July 3rd. But experts say OPEC resisted a knee-jerk reaction to Iraq's decision to halt oil sales, because the cartel is comfortable with current supply/demand conditions. As for oil stocks, some analysts say supply constraints will continue to be a big issue in the coming months-constraints caused by global capacity limitations, not by Iraq's erratic behavior. Nevertheless, such conditions are likely to be good news for oil shares.<br/>\u00a0<br/> STEVEN PFEIFER, OIL ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: We think we clearly are in a period of higher than historical oil prices. We think oil prices will be in a range of roughly $25 a barrel over the next couple of years, and we think that's going to be a very attractive environment for the oil companies and the oil stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/> PRATT: The scheduling of an OPEC meeting in July has raised expectations for a production increase in the third quarter, a time when demand usually picks up and refiners begin building inventories to weather peak wintertime demand.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Today was the technology and telecom group's turn to shine, as investors shrugged off some poor economic news and focused instead on announcements from Lucent (LU) and chip maker, Xilinx (XLNX) instead The Dow Jones Industrial Average helping lead the way higher, churning a bit in the early going, with advancers and decliners about even on the New York Stock Exchange on heavy volume. The Dow then gained traction in late morning, as buyers came in for Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and<br/>\u00a0<br/>IBM (IBM). And by noontime, the Dow up about 76 point to 11,134.<br/>\u00a0<br/> In afternoon trading, the NASDAQ Composite built on its morning rocket- shot, and that report from Xilinx that chip order cancellations had slowed considerably-kept investors in a buying mood. In late trading, there was precious little profit taking, and the<br/>\u00a0<br/>Dow going on to close with a gain of 114 points at 11,175. The NASDAQ Composite vaulting 77.75 points, a 3.6 percent gain there to close at 2233.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Big board volume back above 1.1 billion shares. No contest between up and down volume.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Transports rising more than 39 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Utilities falling 8 1/2 though.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Closing Tick bullish at +740.<br/>\u00a0<br/> In the broader market, the S&amp;P 500 rising 16 1/2 points, led by strength in computer networking, peripheral and steel makers.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 100 gaining more than 7.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The MidCap finished 9 1/4 points higher.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the CRB dipping a fraction there.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The NYSE Composite rising 5 1/2.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Value Line picking up 6 1/3 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Small Caps, the Russell2000 gaining more than 9.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Broadly-Based Wilshire 5000 rising 171 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Bonds rose strongly as mixed economic data showed a weakening economy, but with falling productivity and rising wage inflation. Poor showings in the latest purchasing managers report and new factory orders spurred traders' hoops of more rate cuts by the Fed. And they ignored reports on first- quarter productivity which fell sharply, and labor costs, which rose at the fastest pace in over a decade.<br/>\u00a0<br/> So corporate and tax free issues rose, and so did Treasuries.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 5-year note gaining 12/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 10-year jumping 17/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the 30-year bond gaining a similar amount, the yield at 5.66 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Finally, the Lehman Brothers Long Bond Index rising almost nine points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> I'll be back later with more of the activity on Wall Street. Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Jeff, a victory today for the struggling steel industry. President Bush called for action that could lead to strict limits on imported steel. The International Trade Commission will look into whether domestic steel makers are being hurt by low cost foreign competition. If they are, imports could be restricted. The move is likely to draw sharp criticism from industries that use steel, like auto makers. And the European Union has already threatened to take the U.S. to the World Trade Organization if imports are limited. Still, Bush said the investigation is in the best interests of the country.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And it's in our nation's interest to make sure that if there are unfair trade practices in the steel industry, we address them at a very, in an aggressive way, which this administration will do.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Major steel producers and labor unions welcomed the news. The chairman of U.S. Steel says that unfairly traded steel has forced 18 domestic producers into bankruptcy and cost 20,000 American jobs.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Well, tomorrow morning, Democrats will take charge of the United States Senate for the first time in seven years. And with that, Maryland's Paul Sarbanes will take over the chairman's gavel of the Senate Banking Committee. On Sarbanes' agenda, consumer protection, privacy and oversight of the Federal Reserve. Washington Bureau Chief Darren Gersh, sat down with Sarbanes today and began by asking him what kind of candidates he hopes the President will pick to fill the vacancies on the Fed.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SEN. PAUL SARBANES (D), MARYLAND: Well, we'll look to see what the President does. I think by and large that Alan Greenspan has done a good job at the Federal Reserve. I differ with him on occasions, but I think he's been, you know, he's able and responsible. And so if you can send him in the mold of responsible and sensitive policy makers with respect to the monetary policies, which obviously affects the workings of the whole economy, why, we'd be satisfied with that. What we don't need are some sort of rigid ideologues of some sort or another. I don't think anyone really, if they stop and think about that, wants that. And members of the Federal Reserve, because they've got to make a lot of tough judgments under-they've got to look at the facts and the circumstances and make a judgment accordingly.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Now you were quite critical of the Federal Reserve last year for raising interest rates too much, in your view.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SARBANES: I thought they went too long and too far. I mean, I think there was a period in there where it was hard to quarrel with them sort of looking at slowing down the economy a little bit, although I'm a big jobs and economic growth person. And I think frankly the economy will take a lot of growth and a lot of low unemployment without necessarily getting an inflation problem.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: But have they come down, in your view, low enough on interest rate since they've been very aggressive and is it maybe time for them to-<br/>\u00a0<br/> SARBANES: Well, they have been aggressive. I mean five times in less than in five months, half point cuts, which I think only supports the proposition that last year they sort of allowed it to get away from them.<br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: But in your view is Fed policy about right now?<br/>\u00a0<br/> SARBANES: Well, I'd be prepared to entertain further cuts because I'm worried about the economy. We're not in a recession. Everyone keeps throwing that word around but, you know, a recession is too successive quarters of negative growth and we're certainly not there. But growth has slowed considerably. The unemployment rate has started to move back up again. And I want the economy, you know, to function in a full employment fashion.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: You said you wanted to hold hearings to look into financial conditions generally. Do you have specific concerns there?<br/>\u00a0<br/> SARBANES: No. But I think what the committee should do as a sort of a regular operating procedure is periodically bring the regulators in and say, well, how do you see the landscape, what's happening, do you have any concerns, are you equipped to deal with the situation as you see it and do you have adequate resources. And I would hope fairly early on in this chairmanship to be able to do that.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: Let me ask you about privacy, because all over the country right now people are opening up their mail and they're getting these long privacy forms from their insurance companies and whatnot. Are those forms meaningful to people? Are they working? Are they helping to protect their privacy?<br/>\u00a0<br/> SARBANES: Well, we don't know yet, and one of the things I think we would look at in the course of looking at the privacy issue more broadly would be how effective are those existing provisions and how are they working. Now, a lot of people are concerned about privacy in the country. We need to look at that. My own view is that what we did on privacy last year, which is leading to these notices that you made reference to, is not enough. And it hasn't fully resolved that issue in terms of giving individuals control over this information. I think most people if you ask them about the information they provide to a financial institution would say, well, that's my information, not theirs, and that they ought not be able then to take it and sort of do with it as they might wish. And so we need to address that issue.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: Senator Sarbanes, thank you.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SARBANES: My pleasure.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: A bumpy start for trading this morning on the NASDAQ. Its main trading system broke down at 9:15 A.M. as technicians were installing more capacity. Traders were still able to get orders executed through other systems and things were back to normal by 10 o'clock in the morning. Jeff, a NASDAQ spokesman told us that they're going to try again to upgrade the system tomorrow, but they don't know when.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Well, that glitch did not hurt tech stocks today. There were plenty of buyers around for those and for the blue chips, as well, with the Dow rising 114 points on the day to 11,175. It's risen more than 260 points in just three sessions, advancers outpacing decliners by a nearly 2 to 1 margin, 199 issues hitting new yearly highs, 13 new lows.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Lucent Technologies (LU) rising $0.49, its chairman implementing its turnaround plan says it's on track an reaffirmed third quarter sales will top second quarter levels.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Nortel Networks (NT) falling $0.28.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Meanwhile, Calpine (CPN) tumbling $2.45. Standard &amp; Poor's reports that concerns are growing for the company will not get paid for contracts with bankrupt Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG). A hearing has been set for July 5th on that matter.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EMC (EMC) gaining $2.85, part of that strong technology group today.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GE (GE), though, slipping $0.27.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Williams Communications (WCG) rising $0.19.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Nokia (NOK) gaining $1.65.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Pfizer (PFE) falling $0.52.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And Deutsche Telekom (DT) edged up $0.14.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Corning (GLW) advanced $1.10 on the day.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Among the widely helds, Celera Genomics (CRA) rising $3.25. J.P. Morgan is urging investors to revisit the biotech sector because it believes growth is sustainable over the next three to six months.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Chevron (CHV) dipped $0.33. The oil firm announced plans to cut gasoline output at two California refineries if they are not exempted from rolling power blackouts this summer.<br/>\u00a0<br/>IBM (IBM) shooting up 3 1/4.<br/>\u00a0<br/>J.C. Penney (JCP) advanced more than $2 after Lehman Brothers upgraded the stock and said that the company's Eckerd Drug Store assets are worth at least $25 a share alone. It also raised estimates on the year.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Micron Technology (MU) rising more than 3 1/2.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And shares in USX-U.S. Steel Group (X) heating up, rising $1.70. And as you hear, the Bush administration taking aim at rejuvenating the steel industry. It's launching an investigation into alleged foreign dumping of steel in the U.S.<br/>\u00a0<br/> On the plus side, there's Bethlehem Steel (BS), another beneficiary today of that.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Dycom Industries (DY) soaring 3 1/2. Third quarter earnings came in at $0.31. That's a $0.05 above Street estimates and also implementing a $25 million buy back plan for its stock.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KV Pharmaceutical (KV.A) rising $3.79. It posted fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.26 a share. That was in line with Street estimates.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Three-Five Systems (TFS) advanced $1.20. But today the firm began selling a new high resolution test kit that will be used by electronic gear makers.<br/>\u00a0<br/> On the down side, FiberMark (FMK) falling $1.75, perhaps some profit taking. A spokesperson says the stock is very thinly traded and has had a huge run-up in recent months.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And another one, Global Power Equipment Group (GEG), down 3 1/2. The stock just went public a few weeks ago, 20, and ran up to a top of about $36 a share.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Nasdaq Composite bolting 77 3/4 points higher to 2,233. Volume, 1.8 billion shares and advancers outnumbered decliners by a 24 to 13 margin.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Microsoft (MSFT) advanced $1.82.<br/>\u00a0<br/> We see a similar move in Cisco Systems (CSCO). A big day for all of the networking equipment stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Intel (INTC) rising $1.23. The chip makers all did well today, as well.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Check Point Software (CHKP) falling $1.50.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Juniper Networks (JNPR) rising $2.14.<br/>\u00a0<br/> CIENA (CIEN) rising $4.84.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Dell Computer (DELL) rising $1.22 on the day.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Applied Materials (AMAT) advancing $2.45.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Comverse Technology (CMVT), a big gain there, up nearly $9. First quarter earnings coming in at $0.43 a share.That beat estimates by a $0.01 and it also led analysts to raise their yearly profit estimates by $0.01 as well to $1.79.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Siebel Systems (SEBL) gained $2.53.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Meanwhile, shares in Ulticom (ULCM) climbed nearly 4.<br/>\u00a0<br/>IBM (IBM) plans to integrate Ulticom's Signal Ware products into some of Signal Ware products into some of its products, including Websphere software and select telecom platforms.<br/>\u00a0<br/> RF Micro Devices (RFMD) jumped $3.45. Merrill Lynch says the recent pull back from $36 is a \"buying opportunity.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/> Xilinx (XLNX) soaring more than 4. This is the company many say was the reason for the tech rally today. Late yesterday the company told analysts it is maintaining its previous first quarter guidance and said cancellations have slowed considerably so perhaps some stabilization there.<br/>\u00a0<br/> On the AMEX, the Composite Index jumping 8 3/4 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Medtox (TOX) rising $2.30. The stock jumped 50 percent in four days. Analysts say there is growing excitement over the company's diagnostic testing business and its clinical trial services unit.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Shares in Measurement Specialties (MSS) falling more than 6. Fourth quarter profits nearly doubled. But the stock was down apparently because of concern about higher inventory levels. The company says those are due, though, to acquisitions and its moving of some production to China not because of slowing sales.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And finally, the Index Shares all ended on an up note, especially the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ).<br/>\u00a0<br/> That's the Wall Street Wrap Up. Susie?<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Thanks, Jeff. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat keep the postman from delivering, but high fuel prices could be a problem. The United States Postal Service said today that it expects to post an annual loss of as much as $2.5 billion because of soaring fuel prices and the slow economy. The Postal Service said it might cut out Saturday mail delivery to save money. It's also planning a freeze on hiring and capital spending to minimize losses.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Tomorrow, meet Michigan Senator Carl Levin. He's taking a key role in the Senate, chairing the Armed Services Committee.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: More turbulence for the merger between United Airlines (UAL) and U.S. Airways (U). Transportation Secretary Norman<br/>\u00a0<br/> Mineta told NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT that the merger will probably be grounded. Asked if he thinks the deal is dead, Mineta said \"If I were to read the tea leaves as they are right now, yes.\" But United told us it's still committed to the deal and U.S. Airways says it's working with the Justice Department.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Well, first he retired from Hewlett-Packard (HWP), now Lewis Platt is retiring from his retirement job running the Kendall-Jackson Winery. Platt joined the winery in 1999 after leaving H.P. The 60-year-old Platt says he plans an active retirement, including serving on several corporate boards, philanthropic work and growing grapes on his Sonoma county ranch. Winery Chairwoman Barbara Banke will take on Platt's CEO duties.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Many money managers are having a hard time making money in this market, but one who's doing just fine is Kenneth Heebner, Portfolio Manager of the CGM Funds. His CGM Focus Fund (CGMFX) was up more than 14 percent for the first five months of the year and for the year that ended in May, it was up more than 72 percent. It has 20 to 30 stocks, mostly in small to midcap companies. And when I talked to Heebner earlier today from Boston, I asked him what's the unifying theme behind his successful stock picks.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KENNETH HEEBNER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CGM FOCUS FUNDS: Well, we've been in some smaller stocks that were not widely followed that were doing well, some restaurant companies, some apparel retailers and some home builders. And basically the stocks are doing well. The earnings are coming through and they're getting better recognized.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: So, but Ken, what is the key to the success?<br/>\u00a0<br/> HEEBNER: Finding companies with good earnings growth and low price to earnings ratios in a market where price to earnings ratios are generally quite high.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Ken, give us the names of a few of the top holdings.<br/>\u00a0<br/> HEEBNER: One of the top holdings is Skechers (SKX), which is a sneaker company. They're gaining share. It's obviously, there's a fashion element here, but right now the company is really on a roll. Another one is Lennar Corporation (LEN), which is a home builder. I know the economy is soft, but their orders are strong and in the month of May they were up 20 percent. This company doesn't know that business is weak. The stock's selling about seven times next year's earnings. Another company is P.F. Chang's Bistro (PFCB), a restaurant chain They're really the only national chain offering very attractively priced Chinese food, growing at 25 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: As you look ahead and as you size up the economy and consumer spending, do you think that your stock picking strategy is going to change? Are you going to maybe go to larger cap stocks or are you pretty much going to stick to these smaller and midcap stocks that are in your portfolio?<br/>\u00a0<br/> HEEBNER: I think we're going to stay with, as long as the values that I'm looking at are present, we're going to stay with the smaller and midcap stocks. I think we're going to see continued weakness in the economy with the Fed continuing to ease and I think you're going to see market, the companies that are doing well continue to do well in expectation of a stronger economy next year when the economy responds to the Fed stimulus.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Now, in your fund you are allowed to short stocks, which is an unusual feature. To what extent has shorting stocks contributed to the success?<br/>\u00a0<br/> HEEBNER: We have generally not done a lot of shorting except last year when we saw a tremendous disconnect between the valuation of the technology sector and a lot of the companies in the outlook. We increased the short position during the year to as high as 45 or 50 percent and really kept it there into the beginning of the year 2001.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And there were big gains here. Today the short position is less than 20 percent and I really wouldn't expect to go back into the short position of that size going forward.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Now, your fund, you do, because you do short stocks, it is an aggressive opportunity fund and so it has a lot of ups and downs. For what kind of investor is it best suited?<br/>\u00a0<br/> HEEBNER: I don't think this fund really ought to be a core holding. I think if somebody looked at the portfolio they wouldn't recognize most of the names. I think for most people among mutual funds, short selling is something new. Day-to-day the fund can be more volatile because even though companies have a poor future, they can go up a lot in a single day when you're short.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: OK. Well, listen, thank you so much. Good luck to you for the rest of the year. We really appreciate your talking to us. My guest tonight, Kenneth Heebner, Portfolio Manager of CGM Funds.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: And recapping today's market action, gains all around, with the Dow closing up 114, the NASDAQ gained 77.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And please be sure to join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And finally, we've told you about the move of Vermont's Senator James Jeffords out of the Republican Party, but something else is moving too: his desk! Tomorrow morning, workers will move Jeffords' desk to the Democratic side of the aisle, shifting around other desks so that they can make room. Holes have already been drilled for the desks' legs and for phone wiring. On the GOP side, Jeffords sat in the last row. On the Democrats' side, he'll sit in the next to last row between senators from Massachusetts and Montana. And, Jeff, that spot was chosen because his desk apparently could most easily fit there.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Well, he may be sitting in the next to last row but everyone knows who he is now, that's for sure.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: That is sure. And I wonder what his perspective will be whether in the next to last row but on the other side of the aisle, right?<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Either way it's very important. The man has shifted the presence of power in the U.S. Senate.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Absolutely. You're right about that.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: Well, that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June 5th. I'm Jeff Yastine. Goodnight, everyone. Good night to you, Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Goodnight, Jeff. I'm Susie Gharib. We'll see all of you tomorrow night.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBR-R01060500118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">nitbus2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:436P-N640-008R-X2XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3884\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Nightly Business Report</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Community Television Foundation\u00a0 of South Florida, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>June 5, 2001</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.<br/>\u00a0<br/> LINDA O'BRYON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Dell can really sell over the Internet. The company racks up $30 million a day in online sales in the second quarter, helping it rack up better than expected earnings. Good evening, everyone, I'm Linda O'Bryon. Susie Gharib is off tonight.<br/>\u00a0<br/> PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And I'm Paul Kangas. More good news on inflation sparks a rally in the bond market, and a nice gain in stocks as well. The Dow closes the day up 70 points. The NASDAQ Index gains almost 26. Then the United Auto Workers Union votes to give their leaders a bargaining tool in talks with Ford (F). We'll show you what's at stake in negotiations for a national contract.</p><p>Texas-based Dell Computer posted some Texas-sized earnings today after the close of trading. Dell earned $0.19 a share in the second quarter, up a whopping 58 percent from last year and $0.02 better than estimates. The computer maker's strategy of bundling Internet services with its PCs, paid off big time, giving Dell over $30 million a day in online sales. Analyst Art Russell says PC demand is extremely strong right now because everyone wants to be on the Net.<br/>\u00a0<br/> ART RUSSELL, COMPUTER ANALYST, EDWARD JONES: We are seeing a huge increase in demand even in what had traditionally been seasonally the weakest quarter of the year, during the summer. Usually the consumer market is strongest back to school and Christmas. And so it's kind of surprising the level of demand we're seeing right now. And that could continue to accelerate throughout the year.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Meanwhile, another big tech company announced solid earnings after the close today. Applied Materials earned $0.61 a share in its third quarter, beating Street estimates by $0.08 a share. It also showed sharply higher new orders for the period. Analysts say that may mean the semiconductor industry may finally be coming out of its slump; a slump sparked by the Asian economic crisis.<br/>\u00a0<br/> O'BRYON: Good news on the inflation front gave Wall Street reason to cheer today. The Consumer Price Index is the last major piece of economic data that the Federal Reserve will examine before its meeting next week. But will it keep the Fed from raising rates? Erika Miller reports.<br/>\u00a0<br/> ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In malls across America, clothing and computer prices have been falling sharply. Those declines are a key reason inflation remained in check at the checkout last month. Even rising prices for gasoline, cigarettes, and airline tickets didn't cause much of an up-tick in the Consumer Price Index. It rose a mild 3/10 of a percent in July, in line with expectations. The core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose even less.<br/>\u00a0<br/> STEPHEN SLIFER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: The thing that's amazing to me is that in the first seven months of this year, the core CPI is increasing at a 1.6 percent annual rate. Last year it was 2.5 percent. And you have to go all the way back to 1965 to find a time when core prices were rising more slowly.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MILLER: But other data out today is pointing to a strong economy, which some fear will aggravate inflation. First, industrial production posted its biggest monthly increase since March, rising 7/10 of a percent last month. In addition, housing starts rose 5.7 percent in July to an annual rate of nearly 1.7 million units. But housing activity is expected to ease up.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECS: The trend in housing activity has begun to slow. It's almost certainly going to continue to move to slower levels of activity. Why? Because mortgage rates are higher than they were earlier in the year.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MILLER: Financial markets cheered the numbers. Bonds held their gains throughout the session, while stocks seesawed. Despite today's mixed economic data, economists say a rate hike is still a foregone conclusion.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SLIFER: Like everybody else, we're looking for a rate hike next week. And I think as much of a reason for that as any is just that the markets are expecting it.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MILLER: The stock market may be expecting a rate hike, but that doesn't mean it will like it. Higher rates are usually a negative for stocks, because they increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. They also increase the attractiveness of fixed income securities. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Because the rise in July consumer prices matched expectations on Wall Street, the stock market opened moderately higher, extending yesterday's 73-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 45 minutes into the trading session, the Dow rose another 65 points with New York Exchange breadth 8 to 5 positive, while the NASDAQ Index posted a 23 point gain. The early upturn lost its luster as morning trading progressed, partly because news of that stronger than expected rise in July new housing starts might convince the Federal Reserve to keep upward pressure on interest rates. On top of that negative, some market technicians were concerned that this recent rally in stocks was sadly lacking in convincing volume. By noontime then, the Industrial Average fell to a 22 point deficit, the NASDAQ Index was down 12 1/2 points. In early afternoon selling pressures dried up, and in a pattern similar to yesterday, firming bond prices triggered a late rally in stocks. The result was a closing gain in the Dow Industrial Average of 70.29 points putting it at 11117.08. In today's 105 point trading range, the Industrial Average closed right at its best level of the day. The NASDAQ Composite Index finished up 25.94 points at 2671.22. In its 49 point trading range, the Composite Index settled only 8 3/4 points below its very best level of the day.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Big board volume perked up a bit from yesterday's very slow pace. We're up to 690 million shares today, and quite a bit more up volume than down volume. Not quite a 2 to 1 ratio.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Dow Transport Index fell 6 2/3 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> But the Utility Index managed to gain .48.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Closing Tick +867.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 13.39.<br/>\u00a0<br/> A gain of 6.61 in the S&amp;P 100.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MidCap 400 gained 1.83.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index edged up .33.<br/>\u00a0<br/>New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 5.82.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Nearly a 2 1/2 point rise in the Value Line.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Russell 2000 Small Cap Index 2.18.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the broadly based Wilshire 5000 gained 118.69.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The bond market pushed the stronger than expected rise in the July housing starts to the back burner, and focused on the benign Consumer Price Index in hopes that might convince the Fed to hike interest rates maybe only one more time this year. Buyers were also encouraged by the solid reception given to DaimlerChrysler's (DCX) $4.5 billion global debt offering today.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Despite higher gold and oil futures, tax-free and corporate issues ended with 1/4 to 1/2 point gains, and the Treasury market closed broadly higher.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 5-year notes up 9/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 10-year notes had a good day, up 20/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Bellwether 30-year bond up 1 5/32, bringing the yield all the way down to 6.01 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index gained almost 9 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> I'll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Linda.<br/>\u00a0<br/> O'BRYON: Well Paul, the United Auto Workers Union is turning up the heat on the Ford Motor Company. The automaker is about to negotiate a new national contract with the labor union. But as Diane Eastabrook explains, the UAW isn't happy with Ford's plans to spin off its parts division.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Across the U.S. today, Ford's UAW members cast ballots deciding whether to give the union the right to call a national strike against the automaker. A strike authorization vote before a national contract expires isn't unusual. But this one comes unusually early, nearly a month before the September 14 deadline. Local union leaders say the UAW is sending Ford a message. A proposed spin-off of Visteon, the company's parts division, won't happen without major concessions to the union.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DON DEEL, BARGAINING CHMN., UAW LOCAL 588: With Visteon, I think that what they're looking at is keeping those people, those members under the UAW Ford umbrella. In other words, if they spin it off into a separate company, there's a good possibility that they'll want to negotiate a separate contract as well.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: Visteon employs about 80,000 workers worldwide. About a third are UAW members. The division accounted for roughly $18 billion in sales last year. That's about 15 percent of Ford's profits. Analysts say Visteon could be more profitable as a separate company because other auto manufacturers would be more willing to buy parts from a company that is not owned by a competitor. They also argue parts plants aren't as profitable as assembly plants.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MARVIN BEHM, ANALYST, DUFF &amp; PHELPS CREDIT RATING CO: There is a lot of investment in the parts-making in terms of machinery and equipment, and the people. The returns, the rate of return just isn't as much as it is in auto manufacturing at the assembly level.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: Officials at both Ford and the union downplayed the significance of today's vote. On the issue of Visteon, a Ford spokesman would only say: \"we are talking to the union about many issues, Visteon is one of the them.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/> Some analysts speculate Ford may try to spin off Visteon by the end of this year, and that could put pressure on the automaker to quickly negotiate a new national contract with UAW. Diane Eastabrook. NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago Heights, Illinois.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Consumer groups are crying foul tonight over AT&amp;T's plans to be buy MediaOne (UMG) saying the deal could lead to higher cable and Internet access charges. But as Darren Gersh reports, despite the static, analysts believe AT&amp;T will probably still get most of what it wants.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Consumer groups say AT&amp;T's deal to buy MediaOne breaks every Federal rule designed to protect customers from a concentration of cable power.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GENE KIMMELMAN, CO-DIRECTOR, CONSUMERS UNION: The AT&amp;T/MediaOne merger is a blatant, blatant violation of our nation's antitrust laws, our nation's competition laws.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: In a letter to regulators today, consumer groups called on the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to block the MediaOne merger, claiming the deal would give AT&amp;T control of almost 50 percent of the cable TV market. FCC guidelines cap the share of total cable households one company can control at 30 percent. But analysts expect the FCC will approve the merger anyway, because it believes AT&amp;T is the best bet to take on the baby bells.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SCOTT CLELAND, DIR., LEGG MASON PRECURSOR GROUP: The FCC. and the Justice Department want to be supportive of the AT&amp;T transaction, because AT&amp;T is offering the only potential for local telephone competition.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: AT&amp;T promises to deliver advanced cable, Internet and local phone service. But consumer advocates predict that will benefit only the wealthiest consumers.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MATT COOPER, DIR., CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMER: The gain we would make in the telephone market by AT&amp;T's competition is not worth what we'll lose in the cable TV and broadband Internet markets.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: AT&amp;T says its merger will finally make good on the promises made when Congress passed telecommunications reform, and it says consumer groups are wrong to be worried.<br/>\u00a0<br/> JIM MCGANN, SPOKESMAN, AT&amp;T: Their argument is that only a small percentage will benefit. They're wrong about that. All consumers will be able to take advantage of bundles of services, or individual services, if they like.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GERSH: The FCC is reviewing the merger, and a decision is expected later this fall. Analysts expect AT&amp;T will prevail, but it may have to sell off its minority stake in cable competitors, like Time Warner (TWX) to reassure regulators. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.<br/>\u00a0<br/> O'BRYON: Apparently, what its customers want, its customers get. Electronic broker E*TRADE (EGRP) says beginning next month, it will offer after-hours trading to individual investors. The company has entered into a deal with Instinet to provide the service, which E*TRADE says more than 25 percent of its customers requested. The news sent shares of E*TRADE's parent company higher. E*GROUP gained 3 3/8 to close at 30 1/4, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Wall Street's bulls get \"E\" for effort today taking the market out of a midday slump and here we are in the close with over a 70 point gain at 11,117, comfortably over 11,000 again. About 18 stocks higher for every 12 lower. Forty-eight new yearly highs as against 93 new lows.<br/>\u00a0<br/>America Online (AOL) topped the active list on 13.8 million shares, moving up 2 9/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And then Citigroup (C) up 1 5/16. Anything related to the financial arena today did very well, as the bond market rallied.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Disney (DIS) edged up 9/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Micron Technology (MU) down 2 13/16. That stock has been strong recently, due to higher D-RAM prices, but they're leveling off now and so are some of the stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Compaq Computer (CPQ) moved up 1/4, fifth in volume.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DuPont (DD) up 1 1/4, helping the Dow Industrial average.<br/>\u00a0<br/>AT&amp;T (T) edged up 11/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Burlington Resources (BR) down 2 9/16. As we reported after the close of trading yesterday, Burlington will acquire Poco Petroleum (POC.M), a Canadian firm for some $2 billion in Burlington stock and some analysts feel that price is a bit too steep.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Pfizer (PFE) moved up 11/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And tenth in volume, Conoco B (COC) stock down 1/4.<br/>\u00a0<br/>American Express (AXP) up 4 1/4, was the best point gainer in the Dow Industrial Average. As I mentioned the financial stocks did well today.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Goodyear Tire (GT) ended down only 5/16, but traded as low as 54 9/16 this morning. But the company then reported it had little damage in its plants in the area of those nasty Turkish earthquakes, very serious 5.9 on the Richter scale I believe.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Hewlett-Packard (HWP) down 6 5/16. Of course it's the Dow's big loser today, but a little profit taking after third quarter earnings came in $0.05 above expectations yesterday.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Providian Financial (PVN) up 7 9/16. The company's policy is not to comment on its stock activity, but the drop in interest rates a definite plus factor for the financial stocks as I've mentioned.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Williams Sonoma (WSM), the retailer, up 3 13/16. Company in with second quarter earnings nicely higher, $0.12 versus only $0.07 last year and sales up a handsome 23 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Xerox (XRX) moved up 1 11/16. Prudential Securities repeated a \"strong buy\" on that stock.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tiffany &amp; Company (TIF) had a sterling performance today, up 6 5/16. The company in with second quarter earnings at $0.31 a share, way up from last year's $0.19 and $0.07 above the Street estimate. Sales were up 24 percent. Both the Hambrecht &amp; Quist and Standard &amp; Poor's analysts increased earnings estimates.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Midway Games (MWY) had a good day, up 1 5/16. The Webush Morgan Brokerage upgraded the stock from \"hold\" to \"buy.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tokheim Corporation (TOK) up 1 1/16. The company's in a three-year contract to supply BP Amoco (BPA) with gas pumps around the world.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And Granite Construction (GVA) up almost 2 full points. The company received a $49 million contract from the North Carolina Department of Transportation to rebuild sections of highways 185 and US 70 and the company says, since the passage of the highway bill, its business is booming.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Kansas City Southern Industries (KSU) down 4 13/16. The CIBC Oppenheimer Brokerage downgraded it from a \"strong buy\" to just a \"hold.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/> And CSS Industries (CSS) fell 1 3/4. The company has delayed hiring Andrew Kelly as the president of its Cleo Subsidiary because of a dispute with Kelly's prior employer.<br/>\u00a0<br/>NASDAQ trading, a gain of nearly 26 points in the Index. Volume up nicely from yesterday. About 21 stocks higher for every 17 lower.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Microsoft (MSFT) topped the active list, moving up 1/4.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Followed by Dell Computer (DELL) down 5/16, but in after hours trading, Dell stock was trading at 43 after posting those earnings which were $0.02 above the Street estimate for the second quarter.<br/>\u00a0<br/>eBay (EBAY) up 11 or 8 3/4.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Intel (INTC) up 7/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Amazon.com (AMZN) gained almost 11.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And then Yahoo! (YHOO) up 4 3/8, Internets coming alive today.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Cisco Systems (CSCO) gained 3/4.<br/>\u00a0<br/> QUALCOM (QCOM) up 11 5/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Followed by MCIWorldCom (WCOM) up 7/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And Applied Materials (AMAT) up 1 1/4. Those earnings were $0.08 above estimates in the third quarter, but the stock was down to 67 in after hours trading. Apparently some analysts are concerned about slowing growth in new orders.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SilverStream Software (SSSW) went public today and three million shares offered at 16. Opened at 32 1/2.

Linda.<br/>\u00a0<br/> O'BRYON: Well, Paul, mark your calendar. There are only 136 days left until the turn of the millennium. And now is the time to make some decisions about your investment strategy for the year 2000 and beyond. So we're beginning a three-part series on investing in the new millennium. To help you do just that, tonight, Jeff Yastine takes a look at demographics, and how they provide you with some investing signposts.<br/>\u00a0<br/> JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Madison Avenue has long kept a close eye on demographics, and now, so is Wall Street. That's because demographic trends can help identify ahead of time the products and services that groups of consumers will want or need. Demographics can also show where growth opportunities are shrinking-in other words, places not to invest. That's something investors like Linda Miller, a mutual fund portfolio manager, also look out for.<br/>\u00a0<br/> LINDA MILLER, PORTFOLIO MGR., JOHN HANCOCK FUND: No matter how brilliant the management, or how great the product, how astute their marketing and sales and financial management, if there isn't growth in demand possibility in terms of what's underlying that marketplace, I think over time it's very hard to make money.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: So what are some major demographic trends you could invest in? One of course, is the baby boom generation, 78 million strong and born between 1945 and 1964, demographers say this group continuing to alter the U.S. economy as it proceeds into old age in the next century.<br/>\u00a0<br/> LANNY SACHNOWITZ, MGR., AIM DENT DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS FUND: We're looking at baby boomers and their impact on the economy, both in their direct spending, in their savings, but also what other new technology and new products are going to emerge as a result of this huge part of the population growing older and spending more money.<br/>\u00a0<br/> YASTINE: So how do you invest in this trend? Well, as the boomers age, pharmaceutical and medical device companies are likely to benefit, not only because older people generally require more health care services, but because demographers say, the boomer generation wants to stay young while growing old.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Another demographic trend that offers promising investment play, is the growth of the Hispanic-American population. Auto makers and other consumer product manufacturers have noted the rise in Hispanic buying power by advertising directly to that group. And analysts say, they expect television, radio and Internet services that program to Hispanics to benefit most directly.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Also, don't overlook the so-called echo boomers, the children of the baby boomers. This group is currently swelling the ranks of teenagers and young adults, boosting sales of items ranging from trinkets to clothing to CDs and movie tickets. Expect similar results as today's teens become tomorrow's college graduates and first time home buyers.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Finally, a note of caution. Changing interest rates and economic conditions can throw off projections and investments in some fields like health care tend to be slow in paying off. So analysts say, if you're going to successfully invest with demographic trends in mind you must be a truly long-term investor. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Tomorrow: it was a hot sector in the 1980's. Now it's coming back strongly. A look at investing in biotechs.<br/>\u00a0<br/> O'BRYON: It looks like Home Depot (HD) isn't just for do-it-yourselfers anymore. The home improvement retailer reported strong second quarter earnings today, spurred by sales to a growing number of builders and home repair professionals. The company made $0.44 a share. The Street had been expecting $0.39. But despite the strong earnings showing, Home Depot stock fell today. It lost 15/16 to close at 63 1/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: E-stamp is preparing to go public. The decision comes just one week after the U.S. Postal Service gave E-stamp the green light to sell postage online. E-stamp says the total offering will be worth about $85 million, but did not say how many shares it plans to sell. The company has several big name backers including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Excite@Home (ATHM). <br/>\u00a0<br/> O'BRYON: Recapping today's market action, the Dow gaining 70 points. And the NASDAQ gaining almost 26.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Please join us at our World Wide Web site, nbr.com. Or on America Online, keyword \"NBR.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/> Well, as we've mentioned, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT is celebrating two decades on the air this year. As part of that observance, each week we'll look back at business and financial news over the last 20 years. Tonight, a look at news of the week of August 16 through the 22. August 18, 1982; an historic milestone for the New York Stock Exchange, as volume tops 100 million shares for the first time ever. Daily volume would mushroom over the next decade and a half, with the first billion share trading day in October of 1997. On August 19, 1991, Wall Street firm Salomon is suspended from buying Treasury securities at auctions on behalf of its clients after admitting it violated bidding rules. Chairman and CEO John Gutfreund and other top officials resigned. Billionaire investor, and Salomon shareholder, Warren Buffet becomes interim chairman. Six years later, Salomon is bought out by Travelers Group, which merges the firm with its Smith Barney unit. August 21, 1995, two drug makers join forces to become a global force in the pharmaceutical industry. Upjohn agrees to merge with Sweden's Pharmacia in a $6 billion deal.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And fast forward to 1999, that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, August 17th. I'm Linda O'Bryon. Good night, everyone and good night to you, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Good night, Linda. I'm Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBR-R99081701118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">nitbus1999</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3X6C-FYX0-008R-X29C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3894\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Nightly Business Report</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1999 Community Television Foundation\u00a0 of South Florida, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>August 17, 1999</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FORD MOTOR CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FORDP (PAR)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0F (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

Now, the rally was sparked by a good economic report about China.  Manufacturing activity there was the strongest it has been in at least eight months.  Now, there was also a good manufacturing report here in the U.S.  It expanded in March, rebounding from its lowest level since 2016.</p><p>But clearly, the report out of China was the bigger influence, and it was all a reminder that economic growth is important to Wall Street and the growth doesn`t always have to be here at home.</p><p>So, to start April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 329 points, it`s at 26,258, the Nasdaq added 99, the S&amp;P was up by 32.  And April is historically a good month for the market.  The Dow has not declined in the month of April since 2005, the S&amp;P since 2012.</p><p>And the start of this quarter comes at an interesting time.</p><p>Mike Santoli explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A big question on Wall Street entering the second quarter, will the market shift from playing defense to offense?  Looking at the S&amp;P 500`s strong 13 percent gain in the year`s first three months, for its best first quarter in 21 years -- well, it might seem stocks were already running hard on offense, yet for the past month, the market has held up largely because more stable aggressive sectors were doing well, utility and real estate tax, and big tech giants whose business is viewed as insulated from a soft global economy.</p><p>Some strategists argue the recent drop in bond yields and outperformance of defensive sectors is a warning of the approaching end of this economic expansion or at least a longer period of sluggish activity and flat corporate profits.  But another camp has a more bullish take, the market has rotated toward sturdier, safer areas to wait out a global soft patch and embrace the Federal Reserve`s long pause on interest rates.</p><p>The current debate over Fed policy highlights this tricky fork in the road.  Calls have risen for the Fed to cut rates soon as a way to help ensure a growth pickup but the Fed itself is betting the economy remains healthy, giving policymakers time to be patient to see how the data evolve before making a drastic move.  A version of the benign market rotation scenario happened in 2016, that was another time of very low bond yields, a patient Fed and a global economy struggling to get back on track.</p><p>Under a replay of that experience, the market would now remain on alert for signs of an uptick in global growth in response to central bank stimulus efforts and more cyclical geared parts of the market such as industrials and banks could take over some of the job of carrying the indexes higher as the pace of growth quickens.  While it might seem like a delicate and uncertain transition, but that doesn`t make it an implausible one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to David Kelly to talk more about what he sees ahead for the markets and the economy in the second quarter.  He is the chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds.</p><p>Good to see you, David.  Welcome back.</p><p>DAVID KELLY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN FUNDS:  Glad to be here.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s start first of all with the economy.  You maintain that it is slowing down a little bit, but not necessarily going towards a recession.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, that`s right.  In fact, other numbers we got today confirmed that.  If you look at the numbers on construction spending, retail sales, and inventories, those are all actually pretty positive and what they`ve done is they`ve pushed our estimate for first quarter GDP growth up to about 2 percent.  So, it`s not 3 percent that we got last year, but 2 percent is fine.</p><p>I mean, this is an old expansion, sort of moving forward slowly.  If we do 2 percent growth in 2019, I think that should be the best that we can hope for and actually quite good for markets.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But what`s important to Wall Street right now?  I mean, today, as a good example.  We saw this report out of China, the manufacturing there.  That seemed to spark this rally.</p><p>So, is the overseas economy more important right now than our own economy?</p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think it`s part of the story because it`s part of the risk.  I mean, what we`ve seen is what you call a global manufacturing vortex where the manufacturing numbers coming out of particularly big export to companies like Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, they were getting worse and worse month after month, and we`ve seen an end to that in this month`s numbers.</p><p>I was particularly encouraged by the fact the numbers got better in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, sometimes suspicious of Chinese data where we have confirmation there that things aren`t getting much worse there, and perhaps about to turn around.  So, I think that is positive.  It removes the risk there.  I think that is good for markets.</p><p>HERERA:  One of the things that this quarter will most likely see is some sort of resolution one way or the other on Brexit and there are people out there who are saying that is a big risk not only to our economy but to our markets.  How would you rate that?</p><p>KELLY:  No, I don`t think -- ultimately, I think Brexit has been a big splash for Britain, small ripples for the rest of the world.  I think Britain is not as important to the global economy as the global economy is to Britain.  And I wouldn`t necessarily bet on resolution.  It seems to me like the House of Common still can`t figure out what to do, so I think they will probably end up having to punt the ball down the road maybe for quite a few more quarters before they finally figure out if they`re going to leave the European Union.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, for our stock market.  The fourth quarter last year, terrible, the worst in decades, the last quarter the best in a decade.  What do you think happens this quarter?</p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think it`s pretty diverse quarter to quarter.  I mean, that kind of proves it.  I think, overall, if things should continue to get better, because I think we`re at the point of maximum fear about the slowdown trading into a recession.  I think we`re just getting past those fears.</p><p>If get past those fears, we settle into 2 percent growth, I think people are perhaps a little too worried about earnings going negative.  I think earnings will stay positive.  And I do think interest rates will move up a little bit.  So, I think that will help the financials and more cyclical stocks.  But overall, when interest rates are this low, there aren`t as many good alternatives</p><p>And if you think the economy -- the U.S. economy and global economy can move forward, I still would favor equities over bonds.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, David, thank you.  David Kelly with J.P. Morgan Funds.</p><p>KELLY:  Anytime.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A Fed official said today now is not the time to cut interest rates.  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari believes rates are in the right place right now and that pausing future increases allows the central bank to get more information on the economy.  As we reported on Friday, the White House called for the Fed to cut interest rates by half a point and do it immediately.</p><p>HERERA:  With the health of the economy in focus, a handful of new reports took on extra importance today.</p><p>Steve Liesman has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Economic data in the U.S. today coming in a bit better than expected, prompting economists to upgrade a still weak outlook for growth in the first quarter.  And we now have our first look at expectations for the second quarter.  The CNBC rapid update for the first quarter tracking at 1.5 percent GDP growth, that`s down from the fourth quarter, but up 0.2 from prior forecasts.</p><p>And the second quarter looks pretty healthy, up 2.7 percent, is now the expectation for the current quarter we`re in now.</p><p>We got there the hard way.  February retail sales were much lower than expectations, down 0.2 percent while economists were looking for up 2 percent.  But January revised up sharply from that initial 0.2 percent to now 0.7 percent.  The two sort of cancel each other out but on balance left, economists thinking the consumer was going to do better than originally expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, a key manufacturing index from the Institute of Supply and Management for March coming in better than expected at a healthy 55.3, while spending topped ant estimates by a long way with a 1 percent gain.  The slowdown, is it coming?  The slowdown is here, but it`s just not looking as weak right now as economists first feared.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A new report says auto sales in the first quarter hit their slowest phase in more than four years.  Now, this was released one day before automakers themselves report sales for March which are expected to show a month of solid but slower growth.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It looks like the consumer is finally tapping the brakes when it comes to buying new cars and trucks.  J.D. Power analyzed sales of almost 3 million new vehicles in the first quarter and says the pace of sales is the slowest the industry has seen since late 2014.</p><p>DAVE HABIGER, J.D. POWER CEO:  We`re seeing people perhaps have fewer cars than in the past because of new services.  But in general, the overall economy and what see with the auto manufacturers, this isn`t something we would find alarming.  It doesn`t look like 2013 or `14 type event.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Since 2015, annual auto sales have topped 17 million vehicles, the best four-year stretch ever in the U.S.  So why is demand cooling off?</p><p>One factor is higher interest rates for auto loans, which means higher monthly payments.  Still, with Americans showing strong consumer confidence and unemployment at its lowest level in decades, there are still plenty of people willing to spend big bucks, especially for new pickups.</p><p>In fact, J.D. Power says automaker revenue hit a record high last quarter.</p><p>HABIGER:  I think they want to buy pickup trucks.  They like them.  They`re practical.  They work their way through the snow reasonably well.  These things change but in 2019, we`re going to see a continued move to pickup trucks and SUVs.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Automakers believe the slowdown in sales is not the beginning of a major drop in business.  Instead, they`re hoping this is simply a case of some consumers taking their foot off the gas and thinking twice before buying a new car or truck.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Gas prices are rising, along with a price of oil.  Today, domestic crude it hit a five-month high on that positive economic data that we told you about earlier on the program.  Tighter supplies from a possible decrease in output from OPEC nations also contributed to the increase.  Crude settled up nearly 2.5 percent to more than $61 a barrel.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of UPS.  They were upgraded to buy from hold at Berenberg.  The analyst says that that company has built a strong business globally and will continue to show margin improvement as a result.  Price target now $130 and shares rose more than 2 percent today to $114.43.</p><p>But that same analyst at Berenberg downgraded rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to hold from buy.  The analyst cited the headwinds in some markets and issues still related to FedEx`s acquisitions three years ago with international carrier TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR).  Price target now $200.  Shares closed today at $186.45.  That was up nearly 3 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  Wells Fargo`s rating was cut to market perform from outperform at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.  The analyst says the bank will save less in expenses than previously believed.  The price target is $50.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed at $48.81, up 1 percent.</p><p>Lennar (NYSE:LEN) was downgraded to outperform from strong buy at Raymond James, still a positive rating but it is considered a downgrade.  The analyst says he`s moderating his view of the stock based on its valuation, but he`s still constructive on the overall outlook.  Price target is $55, the shares finished the day at $48.91, down just a fraction.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is doing what many companies don`t -- it`s asking lawmakers for tougher regulation.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Boeing`s software fix for its 737 MAX aircraft may now take longer than estimated.  The FAA said today that more time is needed for additional work by the company to ensure that Boeing (NYSE:BA) has identified and appropriately addressed all issues.  The government regulator now expects that fix to be submitted in the coming weeks.</p><p>HERERA:  The country`s major airlines are recovering from delays caused by a system failure.  The FAA said several carriers experienced issues with a commonly used flight planning software.  That prevented some flights from taking off and quickly rippled through the system.  The airplanes affected included Southwest, which had more than one-fifth of its morning flight schedule impacted and SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW), which is an operator for United and Delta.</p><p>Last week, several airlines reported problems with its reservation system which is run by a company called Sabre.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Saudi Aramco has now topped Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world`s most profitable company.  The oil company revealed its net profits reached $111 billion last year.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a net profit of about $60 billion.  Saudi Aramco made its financial information available in a prospectus for a proposed $10 billion bond sale.</p><p>Now, despite its level of earnings, Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) did not give Aramco its top credit rating due to a heavy dependence on the Saudi economy right now.</p><p>Separately, there are reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) cut the price of its iPhone and Mac products in China.  CNBC says the price declines total about 6 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  As we`ve been reporting, the drum beat for regulation of Internet companies is growing louder and today in a \"Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\" op-ed, Facebook`s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, outlined how exactly he thought it should be done.</p><p>But as Julia Boorstin explains, reactions have been mixed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mark Zuckerberg thinks regulation is inevitable, so he`s proposing what it should look like, outlining new rules for the Internet for harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability, saying he wants regulators to set standards at what counts as terrorists as inappropriate condition content, whether an ad counts as political.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, RECODE:  I don`t think you can`t offload freedom of speech unto the government.  The government has rules around freedom of speech having to do with the government.</p><p>This is a private company.  And I got to say, this is his job.  He`s got to clean up this mess and he can`t turn to the government for that.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Zuckerberg advocating for a global framework for privacy regulation based on European rules and common standards for transferring data.  But this advocacy for new laws won`t protect Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from pending investigations by the FTC, Justice Department and SEC.  And just last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with enabling discrimination, but this could help Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) work with Congress as both sides of the aisle scrutinize the platform.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner who`s been leading the call for privacy regulation saying, quote, I`m glad to see that Mr. Zuckerberg is finally acknowledging what I`ve been saying for the past two years.  The heir of the social media Wild West is over.</p><p>JAMES PETHOKOUKIS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Big companies should be able to handle regulations.  They would prefer not to have them, but as we`ve seen already in Europe, that these regulations have hurt investment in smaller companies, it allowed the market share for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to expand.  So, listen, there`s going to be regulation.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) preferred they can somehow mold them.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  But Representative David Cicilline says they don`t want Facebook`s involvement in the process, tweeting, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is under criminal and civil investigation and it has shown it cannot regulate itself.  Does anyone want his advice?</p><p>This comes amid reports from India that widespread fake news on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp could impact the upcoming elections.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram have deleted hundreds of pages in India to block manipulation.  But the ongoing spread of fake news speaks to just how daunting Facebook`s challenges are.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A bumpy road for Lyft shares and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The ride-hailing company slipped below its IPO price today of $72 a share in this second day of trading.  Many analysts are now citing a number of challenges for the money losing company including slowing market share gains and competitive pressures.  Lyft as you know went public just on Friday, beating its biggest rival, Uber, to the stock market.  Lyft today closed down just about 12 percent to $69 and a penny.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kellogg (NYSE:K) is selling one of its best known brands to Italian food company Ferrero for about $1.3 billion.  The cereal maker is parting ways with Keebler, Famous Amos and various fruit snacks businesses.  Kellogg (NYSE:K) last year said that it was exploring the sale of some brands in order to refocus its operations.  Ferrero is the maker of Nutella among many other brands.  Kellogg (NYSE:K) lost more than 2 percent today to $56.02.</p><p>And Cal-Maine reported better than expected earnings and revenue.  The company pointed to a strong demand for eggs led by a specialty business.  Cal-Maine`s increase, though, in revenue comes despite a drop in egg prices.  Shares were off about 3 percent today to $43.27.</p><p>HERERA:  March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau fell slightly but it was higher than analysts had expected, and that was good news for Wynn Reports, which is estimated to get nearly 70 percent of its revenue from that region.  And shares rose more than 8 percent to $129.34.</p><p>ComScore`s CEO and president are both stepping down.  According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", the chief executive cited, quote, irreconcilable differences with the board over the company`s strategy and execution.  Both executives have been at the company less than a year.  A current director will serves as interim CEO.  But ComScore lost nearly 30 percent today.</p><p>And PG&amp;E may not be able to resume dividend payments to shareholders right away.  A federal judge wants California`s largest utility to trim hundreds of thousands of trees near its power lines before it can give money back to its investors.  The cases related to a 2010 natural gas explosion which killed eight people.  The judge oversees PGE`s probation in that case.  PG&amp;E gained 1 percent to $18.01.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  To the housing market now.  As you may know, mortgage rates fell sharply last week, potentially creating a very big opportunity for a lot of homeowners carrying a mortgage.</p><p>Diana Olick has the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  America`s homeowners just saw the biggest one-week mortgage rate drop in a decade.  The average on the 30-year fixed fell to nearly 4 percent, which meant 4.9 million borrowers could likely qualify for a refinance and reduce their interest rate by at least three-quarters of a percentage point according to Black Knight.  That was nearly a 50 percent increase in the number of those who could benefit.</p><p>Of course, it`s important to factor in closing costs which would be amortized over the length of the loan.  For someone not intending to stay in the home for more than a few years, a refi might not save them enough, but for nose planning on staying on a $300,000 mortgage, refinancing from 4.81 percent to 4.06 percent would save the homeowner about $133 a month 4.06 percent would save the homeowner about $133 per month.</p><p>On $600,000 loan, it would be twice that, or $267 per month.  It was a boon not just to borrowers but to lenders as well.  Not only was call volume higher last week for those in mortgage business, but lenders were reaching out to clients, making sure they knew of a potential savings.</p><p>Mortgage rates are popping higher again today as the bond market sells off, which just goes to show how volatile this market is.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the bipartisan effort to change some popular savings plans and to improve retirement security.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  When it comes to retirement, Americans are feeling more confident but they`re still worried.  According to a new survey from CNBC and financial technology firm Acorns, more than half of adults are somewhat more confident or much more confident about their retirement plans than they were just three years ago, and yet saving for retirement ranks as the overall top personal finance concern.  And that`s especially true for those between the ages of 45 and 64.</p><p>By the way, NBCUniversal and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) ventures are investors in Acorns.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC, which produces this program.</p><p>HERERA:  Today starts financial literacy month.  It was established in 2003 to teach Americans how to learn and maintain healthy financial habits.</p><p>But with retirement as a top concern, we asked Bob Pisani to take a look at how much Americans have really saved.  As he reports, it`s not a pretty picture.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Do you know where your retirement is?  Americans can certainly use help, baby boomers in particular, that`s me.  We`ve not saved nearly enough for retirement.  We`re going to live longer than most of us think and if the trends continue, some of us are going to run out of money before we die.</p><p>Just look at the state of the three legs of the retirement stool.  You got private savings, you got pensions and you have Social Security.</p><p>Let`s start with the private savings.  At Vanguard, the average 401(k) account for an investor who`s 65 years old and up was just under $193,000 in 2018, but that a number is inflated by a small group of super savers.  The median balance, half have more, half have less, for the age group, it`s $58,000 for a 65-year-old.</p><p>Try averaging that over 20 years, say.  Most Americans are expected to live into their 80s, remember, so you`re not pulling out a lot on a yearly basis, 5 percent of that maybe a year, $3,000.</p><p>Let`s look at pensions.  The state of those who have pensions aren`t much better.  The median private pension last year was only about $9,000 a year.  Finally, Social Security, in 2018, average social security check about $1,400 a month.  Let`s say that`s $17,000 a year.</p><p>So, let`s add all this up.  What do we have?  We get just a little more than $29,000 a year.  But it`s certainly possible to live on $29,000 a year, particularly if you live in a relatively low-cost part of the country.</p><p>But it`s hardly a robust retirement.  And remember something, these are the lucky ones.  A study but the St. Louis Federal Reserve found that only 27 percent of households have a defined benefit plan, as a pension plan.  And only one-third have a defined contribution plan.  That`s like a 401(k).  That`s not a lot of people.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, as it happens, retirement may be one area where Republicans and Democrats in Congress can actually agree, and they`re working together to make changes to some very popular savings plans.</p><p>Ylan Mui has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tomorrow, Congress will begin debating the biggest piece of retirement legislation in more than a decade.  And it actually stands a pretty good chance of becoming law.  It`s called Secure Act and the goal is to expand access to private retirement savings, especially for people who work in small businesses.</p><p>PAUL RICHMAN, INCOME RETIREMENT INSTITUTE:  It`s packaging them all into a comprehensive piece of legislation that would address many of these little issues that have cropped up over the years where solutions have been offered to try to increase the ability of workers to save for their retirement.</p><p>MUI:  This bill allows small businesses so band together, to offer 401(k) plans to their employees.  It repeals the maximum age for IRA contributions, which is currently 70-1/2.  It also requires companies to allow long-term, part-time workers to participate in 401(k) plans.  It also lets you withdraw from your IRA for a birth or an adoption without a penalty.</p><p>And there`s a provision that expands the use of 529s to pay for home schooling or private schools or even to pay off your student loans.  The House Ways and Means Committee will take up this bill tomorrow and it`s got the backing to top Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>GOP Congressman Mike Kelly is one of the co-sponsors.</p><p>REP. MIKE KELLY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  We were sent here by our folks in back home to act in their best interest, not our best interest or our party`s but in the best interest of the people, which to me is the real reason all of us come to Washington to serve.</p><p>MUI:  The Senate has been working on a similar proposal.  Experts are calling it practical, commonsense legislation.</p><p>SHAI AKABAS, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER:  This is the next important step in the process that is Congress, but I think there`s a lot of optimism to getting something across the finish line later this year.</p><p>MUI:  This could be a rare example of successful bipartisanship amid divided government.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a final look at the day on Wall Street.  The Dow gained 329 points to 26,258, the Nasdaq added 99 and the S&amp;P was up 32.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffith.  Have a great evening.

Stocks soar on the first day of the second quarter and some are asking whether the market is about to shift from playing defense to offense.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Call for regulation.

Millions of Americans are now in a position to save money on their mortgages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, April 1st.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>The Dow rallied today, back above 26,000 to start this second quarter. Now, the rally was sparked by a good economic report about China. Manufacturing activity there was the strongest it has been in at least eight months. Now, there was also a good manufacturing report here in the U.S. It expanded in March, rebounding from its lowest level since 2016.</p><p>But clearly, the report out of China was the bigger influence, and it was all a reminder that economic growth is important to Wall Street and the growth doesn`t always have to be here at home.</p><p>So, to start April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 329 points, it`s at 26,258, the Nasdaq added 99, the S&amp;P was up by 32. And April is historically a good month for the market. The Dow has not declined in the month of April since 2005, the S&amp;P since 2012.</p><p>And the start of this quarter comes at an interesting time.</p><p>Mike Santoli explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A big question on Wall Street entering the second quarter, will the market shift from playing defense to offense? Looking at the S&amp;P 500`s strong 13 percent gain in the year`s first three months, for its best first quarter in 21 years -- well, it might seem stocks were already running hard on offense, yet for the past month, the market has held up largely because more stable aggressive sectors were doing well, utility and real estate tax, and big tech giants whose business is viewed as insulated from a soft global economy.</p><p>Some strategists argue the recent drop in bond yields and outperformance of defensive sectors is a warning of the approaching end of this economic expansion or at least a longer period of sluggish activity and flat corporate profits. But another camp has a more bullish take, the market has rotated toward sturdier, safer areas to wait out a global soft patch and embrace the Federal Reserve`s long pause on interest rates.</p><p>The current debate over Fed policy highlights this tricky fork in the road. Calls have risen for the Fed to cut rates soon as a way to help ensure a growth pickup but the Fed itself is betting the economy remains healthy, giving policymakers time to be patient to see how the data evolve before making a drastic move. A version of the benign market rotation scenario happened in 2016, that was another time of very low bond yields, a patient Fed and a global economy struggling to get back on track.</p><p>Under a replay of that experience, the market would now remain on alert for signs of an uptick in global growth in response to central bank stimulus efforts and more cyclical geared parts of the market such as industrials and banks could take over some of the job of carrying the indexes higher as the pace of growth quickens. While it might seem like a delicate and uncertain transition, but that doesn`t make it an implausible one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Let`s turn now to David Kelly to talk more about what he sees ahead for the markets and the economy in the second quarter. He is the chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds.</p><p>Good to see you, David. Welcome back.</p><p>DAVID KELLY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN FUNDS: Glad to be here.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s start first of all with the economy. You maintain that it is slowing down a little bit, but not necessarily going towards a recession.</p><p>KELLY: Well, that`s right. In fact, other numbers we got today confirmed that. If you look at the numbers on construction spending, retail sales, and inventories, those are all actually pretty positive and what they`ve done is they`ve pushed our estimate for first quarter GDP growth up to about 2 percent. So, it`s not 3 percent that we got last year, but 2 percent is fine.</p><p>I mean, this is an old expansion, sort of moving forward slowly. If we do 2 percent growth in 2019, I think that should be the best that we can hope for and actually quite good for markets.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But what`s important to Wall Street right now? I mean, today, as a good example. We saw this report out of China, the manufacturing there. That seemed to spark this rally.</p><p>So, is the overseas economy more important right now than our own economy?</p><p>KELLY: Well, I think it`s part of the story because it`s part of the risk. I mean, what we`ve seen is what you call a global manufacturing vortex where the manufacturing numbers coming out of particularly big export to companies like Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, they were getting worse and worse month after month, and we`ve seen an end to that in this month`s numbers.</p><p>I was particularly encouraged by the fact the numbers got better in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, sometimes suspicious of Chinese data where we have confirmation there that things aren`t getting much worse there, and perhaps about to turn around. So, I think that is positive. It removes the risk there. I think that is good for markets.</p><p>HERERA: One of the things that this quarter will most likely see is some sort of resolution one way or the other on Brexit and there are people out there who are saying that is a big risk not only to our economy but to our markets. How would you rate that?</p><p>KELLY: No, I don`t think -- ultimately, I think Brexit has been a big splash for Britain, small ripples for the rest of the world. I think Britain is not as important to the global economy as the global economy is to Britain. And I wouldn`t necessarily bet on resolution. It seems to me like the House of Common still can`t figure out what to do, so I think they will probably end up having to punt the ball down the road maybe for quite a few more quarters before they finally figure out if they`re going to leave the European Union.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, for our stock market. The fourth quarter last year, terrible, the worst in decades, the last quarter the best in a decade. What do you think happens this quarter?</p><p>KELLY: Well, I think it`s pretty diverse quarter to quarter. I mean, that kind of proves it. I think, overall, if things should continue to get better, because I think we`re at the point of maximum fear about the slowdown trading into a recession. I think we`re just getting past those fears.</p><p>If get past those fears, we settle into 2 percent growth, I think people are perhaps a little too worried about earnings going negative. I think earnings will stay positive. And I do think interest rates will move up a little bit. So, I think that will help the financials and more cyclical stocks. But overall, when interest rates are this low, there aren`t as many good alternatives</p><p>And if you think the economy -- the U.S. economy and global economy can move forward, I still would favor equities over bonds.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that note, David, thank you. David Kelly with J.P. Morgan Funds.</p><p>KELLY: Anytime.</p><p>GRIFFETH: A Fed official said today now is not the time to cut interest rates. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari believes rates are in the right place right now and that pausing future increases allows the central bank to get more information on the economy. As we reported on Friday, the White House called for the Fed to cut interest rates by half a point and do it immediately.</p><p>HERERA: With the health of the economy in focus, a handful of new reports took on extra importance today.</p><p>Steve Liesman has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Economic data in the U.S. today coming in a bit better than expected, prompting economists to upgrade a still weak outlook for growth in the first quarter. And we now have our first look at expectations for the second quarter. The CNBC rapid update for the first quarter tracking at 1.5 percent GDP growth, that`s down from the fourth quarter, but up 0.2 from prior forecasts.</p><p>And the second quarter looks pretty healthy, up 2.7 percent, is now the expectation for the current quarter we`re in now.</p><p>We got there the hard way. February retail sales were much lower than expectations, down 0.2 percent while economists were looking for up 2 percent. But January revised up sharply from that initial 0.2 percent to now 0.7 percent. The two sort of cancel each other out but on balance left, economists thinking the consumer was going to do better than originally expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, a key manufacturing index from the Institute of Supply and Management for March coming in better than expected at a healthy 55.3, while spending topped ant estimates by a long way with a 1 percent gain. The slowdown, is it coming? The slowdown is here, but it`s just not looking as weak right now as economists first feared.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A new report says auto sales in the first quarter hit their slowest phase in more than four years. Now, this was released one day before automakers themselves report sales for March which are expected to show a month of solid but slower growth.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It looks like the consumer is finally tapping the brakes when it comes to buying new cars and trucks. J.D. Power analyzed sales of almost 3 million new vehicles in the first quarter and says the pace of sales is the slowest the industry has seen since late 2014.</p><p>DAVE HABIGER, J.D. POWER CEO: We`re seeing people perhaps have fewer cars than in the past because of new services. But in general, the overall economy and what see with the auto manufacturers, this isn`t something we would find alarming. It doesn`t look like 2013 or `14 type event.</p><p>LEBEAU: Since 2015, annual auto sales have topped 17 million vehicles, the best four-year stretch ever in the U.S. So why is demand cooling off?</p><p>One factor is higher interest rates for auto loans, which means higher monthly payments. Still, with Americans showing strong consumer confidence and unemployment at its lowest level in decades, there are still plenty of people willing to spend big bucks, especially for new pickups.</p><p>In fact, J.D. Power says automaker revenue hit a record high last quarter.</p><p>HABIGER: I think they want to buy pickup trucks. They like them. They`re practical. They work their way through the snow reasonably well. These things change but in 2019, we`re going to see a continued move to pickup trucks and SUVs.</p><p>LEBEAU: Automakers believe the slowdown in sales is not the beginning of a major drop in business. Instead, they`re hoping this is simply a case of some consumers taking their foot off the gas and thinking twice before buying a new car or truck.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Gas prices are rising, along with a price of oil. Today, domestic crude it hit a five-month high on that positive economic data that we told you about earlier on the program. Tighter supplies from a possible decrease in output from OPEC nations also contributed to the increase. Crude settled up nearly 2.5 percent to more than $61 a barrel.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of UPS. They were upgraded to buy from hold at Berenberg. The analyst says that that company has built a strong business globally and will continue to show margin improvement as a result. Price target now $130 and shares rose more than 2 percent today to $114.43.</p><p>But that same analyst at Berenberg downgraded rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to hold from buy. The analyst cited the headwinds in some markets and issues still related to FedEx`s acquisitions three years ago with international carrier TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR). Price target now $200. Shares closed today at $186.45. That was up nearly 3 percent.</p><p>HERERA: Wells Fargo`s rating was cut to market perform from outperform at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. The analyst says the bank will save less in expenses than previously believed. The price target is $50. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed at $48.81, up 1 percent.</p><p>Lennar (NYSE:LEN) was downgraded to outperform from strong buy at Raymond James, still a positive rating but it is considered a downgrade. The analyst says he`s moderating his view of the stock based on its valuation, but he`s still constructive on the overall outlook. Price target is $55, the shares finished the day at $48.91, down just a fraction.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is doing what many companies don`t -- it`s asking lawmakers for tougher regulation.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Boeing`s software fix for its 737 MAX aircraft may now take longer than estimated. The FAA said today that more time is needed for additional work by the company to ensure that Boeing (NYSE:BA) has identified and appropriately addressed all issues. The government regulator now expects that fix to be submitted in the coming weeks.</p><p>HERERA: The country`s major airlines are recovering from delays caused by a system failure. The FAA said several carriers experienced issues with a commonly used flight planning software. That prevented some flights from taking off and quickly rippled through the system. The airplanes affected included Southwest, which had more than one-fifth of its morning flight schedule impacted and SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW), which is an operator for United and Delta.</p><p>Last week, several airlines reported problems with its reservation system which is run by a company called Sabre.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Saudi Aramco has now topped Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world`s most profitable company. The oil company revealed its net profits reached $111 billion last year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a net profit of about $60 billion. Saudi Aramco made its financial information available in a prospectus for a proposed $10 billion bond sale.</p><p>Now, despite its level of earnings, Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) did not give Aramco its top credit rating due to a heavy dependence on the Saudi economy right now.</p><p>Separately, there are reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) cut the price of its iPhone and Mac products in China. CNBC says the price declines total about 6 percent.</p><p>HERERA: As we`ve been reporting, the drum beat for regulation of Internet companies is growing louder and today in a \"Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\" op- ed, Facebook`s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, outlined how exactly he thought it should be done.</p><p>But as Julia Boorstin explains, reactions have been mixed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mark Zuckerberg thinks regulation is inevitable, so he`s proposing what it should look like, outlining new rules for the Internet for harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability, saying he wants regulators to set standards at what counts as terrorists as inappropriate condition content, whether an ad counts as political.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, RECODE: I don`t think you can`t offload freedom of speech unto the government. The government has rules around freedom of speech having to do with the government.</p><p>This is a private company. And I got to say, this is his job. He`s got to clean up this mess and he can`t turn to the government for that.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Zuckerberg advocating for a global framework for privacy regulation based on European rules and common standards for transferring data. But this advocacy for new laws won`t protect Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from pending investigations by the FTC, Justice Department and SEC. And just last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with enabling discrimination, but this could help Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) work with Congress as both sides of the aisle scrutinize the platform.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner who`s been leading the call for privacy regulation saying, quote, I`m glad to see that Mr. Zuckerberg is finally acknowledging what I`ve been saying for the past two years. The heir of the social media Wild West is over.</p><p>JAMES PETHOKOUKIS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Big companies should be able to handle regulations. They would prefer not to have them, but as we`ve seen already in Europe, that these regulations have hurt investment in smaller companies, it allowed the market share for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to expand. So, listen, there`s going to be regulation. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) preferred they can somehow mold them.</p><p>BOORSTIN: But Representative David Cicilline says they don`t want Facebook`s involvement in the process, tweeting, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is under criminal and civil investigation and it has shown it cannot regulate itself. Does anyone want his advice?</p><p>This comes amid reports from India that widespread fake news on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp could impact the upcoming elections. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram have deleted hundreds of pages in India to block manipulation. But the ongoing spread of fake news speaks to just how daunting Facebook`s challenges are.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A bumpy road for Lyft shares and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The ride-hailing company slipped below its IPO price today of $72 a share in this second day of trading. Many analysts are now citing a number of challenges for the money losing company including slowing market share gains and competitive pressures. Lyft as you know went public just on Friday, beating its biggest rival, Uber, to the stock market. Lyft today closed down just about 12 percent to $69 and a penny.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kellogg (NYSE:K) is selling one of its best known brands to Italian food company Ferrero for about $1.3 billion. The cereal maker is parting ways with Keebler, Famous Amos and various fruit snacks businesses. Kellogg (NYSE:K) last year said that it was exploring the sale of some brands in order to refocus its operations. Ferrero is the maker of Nutella among many other brands. Kellogg (NYSE:K) lost more than 2 percent today to $56.02.</p><p>And Cal-Maine reported better than expected earnings and revenue. The company pointed to a strong demand for eggs led by a specialty business. Cal-Maine`s increase, though, in revenue comes despite a drop in egg prices. Shares were off about 3 percent today to $43.27.</p><p>HERERA: March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau fell slightly but it was higher than analysts had expected, and that was good news for Wynn Reports, which is estimated to get nearly 70 percent of its revenue from that region. And shares rose more than 8 percent to $129.34.</p><p>ComScore`s CEO and president are both stepping down. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", the chief executive cited, quote, irreconcilable differences with the board over the company`s strategy and execution. Both executives have been at the company less than a year. A current director will serves as interim CEO. But ComScore lost nearly 30 percent today.</p><p>And PG&amp;E may not be able to resume dividend payments to shareholders right away. A federal judge wants California`s largest utility to trim hundreds of thousands of trees near its power lines before it can give money back to its investors. The cases related to a 2010 natural gas explosion which killed eight people. The judge oversees PGE`s probation in that case. PG&amp;E gained 1 percent to $18.01.</p><p>GRIFFETH: To the housing market now. As you may know, mortgage rates fell sharply last week, potentially creating a very big opportunity for a lot of homeowners carrying a mortgage.</p><p>Diana Olick has the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: America`s homeowners just saw the biggest one-week mortgage rate drop in a decade. The average on the 30-year fixed fell to nearly 4 percent, which meant 4.9 million borrowers could likely qualify for a refinance and reduce their interest rate by at least three-quarters of a percentage point according to Black Knight. That was nearly a 50 percent increase in the number of those who could benefit.</p><p>Of course, it`s important to factor in closing costs which would be amortized over the length of the loan. For someone not intending to stay in the home for more than a few years, a refi might not save them enough, but for nose planning on staying on a $300,000 mortgage, refinancing from 4.81 percent to 4.06 percent would save the homeowner about $133 a month 4.06 percent would save the homeowner about $133 per month.</p><p>On $600,000 loan, it would be twice that, or $267 per month. It was a boon not just to borrowers but to lenders as well. Not only was call volume higher last week for those in mortgage business, but lenders were reaching out to clients, making sure they knew of a potential savings.</p><p>Mortgage rates are popping higher again today as the bond market sells off, which just goes to show how volatile this market is.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the bipartisan effort to change some popular savings plans and to improve retirement security.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: When it comes to retirement, Americans are feeling more confident but they`re still worried. According to a new survey from CNBC and financial technology firm Acorns, more than half of adults are somewhat more confident or much more confident about their retirement plans than they were just three years ago, and yet saving for retirement ranks as the overall top personal finance concern. And that`s especially true for those between the ages of 45 and 64.</p><p>By the way, NBCUniversal and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) ventures are investors in Acorns. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC, which produces this program.</p><p>HERERA: Today starts financial literacy month. It was established in 2003 to teach Americans how to learn and maintain healthy financial habits.</p><p>But with retirement as a top concern, we asked Bob Pisani to take a look at how much Americans have really saved. As he reports, it`s not a pretty picture.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Do you know where your retirement is? Americans can certainly use help, baby boomers in particular, that`s me. We`ve not saved nearly enough for retirement. We`re going to live longer than most of us think and if the trends continue, some of us are going to run out of money before we die.</p><p>Just look at the state of the three legs of the retirement stool. You got private savings, you got pensions and you have Social Security.</p><p>Let`s start with the private savings. At Vanguard, the average 401(k) account for an investor who`s 65 years old and up was just under $193,000 in 2018, but that a number is inflated by a small group of super savers. The median balance, half have more, half have less, for the age group, it`s $58,000 for a 65-year-old.</p><p>Try averaging that over 20 years, say. Most Americans are expected to live into their 80s, remember, so you`re not pulling out a lot on a yearly basis, 5 percent of that maybe a year, $3,000.</p><p>Let`s look at pensions. The state of those who have pensions aren`t much better. The median private pension last year was only about $9,000 a year. Finally, Social Security, in 2018, average social security check about $1,400 a month. Let`s say that`s $17,000 a year.</p><p>So, let`s add all this up. What do we have? We get just a little more than $29,000 a year. But it`s certainly possible to live on $29,000 a year, particularly if you live in a relatively low-cost part of the country.</p><p>But it`s hardly a robust retirement. And remember something, these are the lucky ones. A study but the St. Louis Federal Reserve found that only 27 percent of households have a defined benefit plan, as a pension plan. And only one-third have a defined contribution plan. That`s like a 401(k). That`s not a lot of people.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, as it happens, retirement may be one area where Republicans and Democrats in Congress can actually agree, and they`re working together to make changes to some very popular savings plans.</p><p>Ylan Mui has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tomorrow, Congress will begin debating the biggest piece of retirement legislation in more than a decade. And it actually stands a pretty good chance of becoming law. It`s called Secure Act and the goal is to expand access to private retirement savings, especially for people who work in small businesses.</p><p>PAUL RICHMAN, INCOME RETIREMENT INSTITUTE: It`s packaging them all into a comprehensive piece of legislation that would address many of these little issues that have cropped up over the years where solutions have been offered to try to increase the ability of workers to save for their retirement.</p><p>MUI: This bill allows small businesses so band together, to offer 401(k) plans to their employees. It repeals the maximum age for IRA contributions, which is currently 70-1/2. It also requires companies to allow long-term, part-time workers to participate in 401(k) plans. It also lets you withdraw from your IRA for a birth or an adoption without a penalty.</p><p>And there`s a provision that expands the use of 529s to pay for home schooling or private schools or even to pay off your student loans. The House Ways and Means Committee will take up this bill tomorrow and it`s got the backing to top Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>GOP Congressman Mike Kelly is one of the co-sponsors.</p><p>REP. MIKE KELLY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: We were sent here by our folks in back home to act in their best interest, not our best interest or our party`s but in the best interest of the people, which to me is the real reason all of us come to Washington to serve.</p><p>MUI: The Senate has been working on a similar proposal. Experts are calling it practical, commonsense legislation.</p><p>SHAI AKABAS, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER: This is the next important step in the process that is Congress, but I think there`s a lot of optimism to getting something across the finish line later this year.</p><p>MUI: This could be a rare example of successful bipartisanship amid divided government.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, here`s a final look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow gained 329 points to 26,258, the Nasdaq added 99 and the S&amp;P was up 32.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffith. Have a great evening.

Stocks soar on the first day of the second quarter and some are asking whether the market is about to shift from playing defense to offense.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Call for regulation.

Now, the rally was sparked by a good economic report about China.  Manufacturing activity there was the strongest it has been in at least eight months.  Now, there was also a good manufacturing report here in the U.S.  It expanded in March, rebounding from its lowest level since 2016.</p><p>But clearly, the report out of China was the bigger influence, and it was all a reminder that economic growth is important to Wall Street and the growth doesn`t always have to be here at home.</p><p>So, to start April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 329 points, it`s at 26,258, the Nasdaq added 99, the S&amp;P was up by 32.  And April is historically a good month for the market.  The Dow has not declined in the month of April since 2005, the S&amp;P since 2012.</p><p>And the start of this quarter comes at an interesting time.</p><p>Mike Santoli explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A big question on Wall Street entering the second quarter, will the market shift from playing defense to offense?  Looking at the S&amp;P 500`s strong 13 percent gain in the year`s first three months, for its best first quarter in 21 years -- well, it might seem stocks were already running hard on offense, yet for the past month, the market has held up largely because more stable aggressive sectors were doing well, utility and real estate tax, and big tech giants whose business is viewed as insulated from a soft global economy.</p><p>Some strategists argue the recent drop in bond yields and outperformance of defensive sectors is a warning of the approaching end of this economic expansion or at least a longer period of sluggish activity and flat corporate profits.  But another camp has a more bullish take, the market has rotated toward sturdier, safer areas to wait out a global soft patch and embrace the Federal Reserve`s long pause on interest rates.</p><p>The current debate over Fed policy highlights this tricky fork in the road.  Calls have risen for the Fed to cut rates soon as a way to help ensure a growth pickup but the Fed itself is betting the economy remains healthy, giving policymakers time to be patient to see how the data evolve before making a drastic move.  A version of the benign market rotation scenario happened in 2016, that was another time of very low bond yields, a patient Fed and a global economy struggling to get back on track.</p><p>Under a replay of that experience, the market would now remain on alert for signs of an uptick in global growth in response to central bank stimulus efforts and more cyclical geared parts of the market such as industrials and banks could take over some of the job of carrying the indexes higher as the pace of growth quickens.  While it might seem like a delicate and uncertain transition, but that doesn`t make it an implausible one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to David Kelly to talk more about what he sees ahead for the markets and the economy in the second quarter.  He is the chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds.</p><p>Good to see you, David.  Welcome back.</p><p>DAVID KELLY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN FUNDS:  Glad to be here.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s start first of all with the economy.  You maintain that it is slowing down a little bit, but not necessarily going towards a recession.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, that`s right.  In fact, other numbers we got today confirmed that.  If you look at the numbers on construction spending, retail sales, and inventories, those are all actually pretty positive and what they`ve done is they`ve pushed our estimate for first quarter GDP growth up to about 2 percent.  So, it`s not 3 percent that we got last year, but 2 percent is fine.</p><p>I mean, this is an old expansion, sort of moving forward slowly.  If we do 2 percent growth in 2019, I think that should be the best that we can hope for and actually quite good for markets.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But what`s important to Wall Street right now?  I mean, today, as a good example.  We saw this report out of China, the manufacturing there.  That seemed to spark this rally.</p><p>So, is the overseas economy more important right now than our own economy?</p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think it`s part of the story because it`s part of the risk.  I mean, what we`ve seen is what you call a global manufacturing vortex where the manufacturing numbers coming out of particularly big export to companies like Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, they were getting worse and worse month after month, and we`ve seen an end to that in this month`s numbers.</p><p>I was particularly encouraged by the fact the numbers got better in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, sometimes suspicious of Chinese data where we have confirmation there that things aren`t getting much worse there, and perhaps about to turn around.  So, I think that is positive.  It removes the risk there.  I think that is good for markets.</p><p>HERERA:  One of the things that this quarter will most likely see is some sort of resolution one way or the other on Brexit and there are people out there who are saying that is a big risk not only to our economy but to our markets.  How would you rate that?</p><p>KELLY:  No, I don`t think -- ultimately, I think Brexit has been a big splash for Britain, small ripples for the rest of the world.  I think Britain is not as important to the global economy as the global economy is to Britain.  And I wouldn`t necessarily bet on resolution.  It seems to me like the House of Common still can`t figure out what to do, so I think they will probably end up having to punt the ball down the road maybe for quite a few more quarters before they finally figure out if they`re going to leave the European Union.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, for our stock market.  The fourth quarter last year, terrible, the worst in decades, the last quarter the best in a decade.  What do you think happens this quarter?</p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think it`s pretty diverse quarter to quarter.  I mean, that kind of proves it.  I think, overall, if things should continue to get better, because I think we`re at the point of maximum fear about the slowdown trading into a recession.  I think we`re just getting past those fears.</p><p>If get past those fears, we settle into 2 percent growth, I think people are perhaps a little too worried about earnings going negative.  I think earnings will stay positive.  And I do think interest rates will move up a little bit.  So, I think that will help the financials and more cyclical stocks.  But overall, when interest rates are this low, there aren`t as many good alternatives</p><p>And if you think the economy -- the U.S. economy and global economy can move forward, I still would favor equities over bonds.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, David, thank you.  David Kelly with J.P. Morgan Funds.</p><p>KELLY:  Anytime.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A Fed official said today now is not the time to cut interest rates.  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari believes rates are in the right place right now and that pausing future increases allows the central bank to get more information on the economy.  As we reported on Friday, the White House called for the Fed to cut interest rates by half a point and do it immediately.</p><p>HERERA:  With the health of the economy in focus, a handful of new reports took on extra importance today.</p><p>Steve Liesman has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Economic data in the U.S. today coming in a bit better than expected, prompting economists to upgrade a still weak outlook for growth in the first quarter.  And we now have our first look at expectations for the second quarter.  The CNBC rapid update for the first quarter tracking at 1.5 percent GDP growth, that`s down from the fourth quarter, but up 0.2 from prior forecasts.</p><p>And the second quarter looks pretty healthy, up 2.7 percent, is now the expectation for the current quarter we`re in now.</p><p>We got there the hard way.  February retail sales were much lower than expectations, down 0.2 percent while economists were looking for up 2 percent.  But January revised up sharply from that initial 0.2 percent to now 0.7 percent.  The two sort of cancel each other out but on balance left, economists thinking the consumer was going to do better than originally expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, a key manufacturing index from the Institute of Supply and Management for March coming in better than expected at a healthy 55.3, while spending topped ant estimates by a long way with a 1 percent gain.  The slowdown, is it coming?  The slowdown is here, but it`s just not looking as weak right now as economists first feared.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A new report says auto sales in the first quarter hit their slowest phase in more than four years.  Now, this was released one day before automakers themselves report sales for March which are expected to show a month of solid but slower growth.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It looks like the consumer is finally tapping the brakes when it comes to buying new cars and trucks.  J.D. Power analyzed sales of almost 3 million new vehicles in the first quarter and says the pace of sales is the slowest the industry has seen since late 2014.</p><p>DAVE HABIGER, J.D. POWER CEO:  We`re seeing people perhaps have fewer cars than in the past because of new services.  But in general, the overall economy and what see with the auto manufacturers, this isn`t something we would find alarming.  It doesn`t look like 2013 or `14 type event.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Since 2015, annual auto sales have topped 17 million vehicles, the best four-year stretch ever in the U.S.  So why is demand cooling off?</p><p>One factor is higher interest rates for auto loans, which means higher monthly payments.  Still, with Americans showing strong consumer confidence and unemployment at its lowest level in decades, there are still plenty of people willing to spend big bucks, especially for new pickups.</p><p>In fact, J.D. Power says automaker revenue hit a record high last quarter.</p><p>HABIGER:  I think they want to buy pickup trucks.  They like them.  They`re practical.  They work their way through the snow reasonably well.  These things change but in 2019, we`re going to see a continued move to pickup trucks and SUVs.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Automakers believe the slowdown in sales is not the beginning of a major drop in business.  Instead, they`re hoping this is simply a case of some consumers taking their foot off the gas and thinking twice before buying a new car or truck.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Gas prices are rising, along with a price of oil.  Today, domestic crude it hit a five-month high on that positive economic data that we told you about earlier on the program.  Tighter supplies from a possible decrease in output from OPEC nations also contributed to the increase.  Crude settled up nearly 2.5 percent to more than $61 a barrel.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of UPS.  They were upgraded to buy from hold at Berenberg.  The analyst says that that company has built a strong business globally and will continue to show margin improvement as a result.  Price target now $130 and shares rose more than 2 percent today to $114.43.</p><p>But that same analyst at Berenberg downgraded rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to hold from buy.  The analyst cited the headwinds in some markets and issues still related to FedEx`s acquisitions three years ago with international carrier TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR).  Price target now $200.  Shares closed today at $186.45.  That was up nearly 3 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  Wells Fargo`s rating was cut to market perform from outperform at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.  The analyst says the bank will save less in expenses than previously believed.  The price target is $50.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed at $48.81, up 1 percent.</p><p>Lennar (NYSE:LEN) was downgraded to outperform from strong buy at Raymond James, still a positive rating but it is considered a downgrade.  The analyst says he`s moderating his view of the stock based on its valuation, but he`s still constructive on the overall outlook.  Price target is $55, the shares finished the day at $48.91, down just a fraction.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is doing what many companies don`t -- it`s asking lawmakers for tougher regulation.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Boeing`s software fix for its 737 MAX aircraft may now take longer than estimated.  The FAA said today that more time is needed for additional work by the company to ensure that Boeing (NYSE:BA) has identified and appropriately addressed all issues.  The government regulator now expects that fix to be submitted in the coming weeks.</p><p>HERERA:  The country`s major airlines are recovering from delays caused by a system failure.  The FAA said several carriers experienced issues with a commonly used flight planning software.  That prevented some flights from taking off and quickly rippled through the system.  The airplanes affected included Southwest, which had more than one-fifth of its morning flight schedule impacted and SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW), which is an operator for United and Delta.</p><p>Last week, several airlines reported problems with its reservation system which is run by a company called Sabre.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Saudi Aramco has now topped Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world`s most profitable company.  The oil company revealed its net profits reached $111 billion last year.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a net profit of about $60 billion.  Saudi Aramco made its financial information available in a prospectus for a proposed $10 billion bond sale.</p><p>Now, despite its level of earnings, Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) did not give Aramco its top credit rating due to a heavy dependence on the Saudi economy right now.</p><p>Separately, there are reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) cut the price of its iPhone and Mac products in China.  CNBC says the price declines total about 6 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  As we`ve been reporting, the drum beat for regulation of Internet companies is growing louder and today in a \"Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\" op-ed, Facebook`s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, outlined how exactly he thought it should be done.</p><p>But as Julia Boorstin explains, reactions have been mixed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mark Zuckerberg thinks regulation is inevitable, so he`s proposing what it should look like, outlining new rules for the Internet for harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability, saying he wants regulators to set standards at what counts as terrorists as inappropriate condition content, whether an ad counts as political.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, RECODE:  I don`t think you can`t offload freedom of speech unto the government.  The government has rules around freedom of speech having to do with the government.</p><p>This is a private company.  And I got to say, this is his job.  He`s got to clean up this mess and he can`t turn to the government for that.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Zuckerberg advocating for a global framework for privacy regulation based on European rules and common standards for transferring data.  But this advocacy for new laws won`t protect Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from pending investigations by the FTC, Justice Department and SEC.  And just last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with enabling discrimination, but this could help Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) work with Congress as both sides of the aisle scrutinize the platform.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner who`s been leading the call for privacy regulation saying, quote, I`m glad to see that Mr. Zuckerberg is finally acknowledging what I`ve been saying for the past two years.  The heir of the social media Wild West is over.</p><p>JAMES PETHOKOUKIS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Big companies should be able to handle regulations.  They would prefer not to have them, but as we`ve seen already in Europe, that these regulations have hurt investment in smaller companies, it allowed the market share for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to expand.  So, listen, there`s going to be regulation.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) preferred they can somehow mold them.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  But Representative David Cicilline says they don`t want Facebook`s involvement in the process, tweeting, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is under criminal and civil investigation and it has shown it cannot regulate itself.  Does anyone want his advice?</p><p>This comes amid reports from India that widespread fake news on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp could impact the upcoming elections.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram have deleted hundreds of pages in India to block manipulation.  But the ongoing spread of fake news speaks to just how daunting Facebook`s challenges are.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A bumpy road for Lyft shares and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The ride-hailing company slipped below its IPO price today of $72 a share in this second day of trading.  Many analysts are now citing a number of challenges for the money losing company including slowing market share gains and competitive pressures.  Lyft as you know went public just on Friday, beating its biggest rival, Uber, to the stock market.  Lyft today closed down just about 12 percent to $69 and a penny.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kellogg (NYSE:K) is selling one of its best known brands to Italian food company Ferrero for about $1.3 billion.  The cereal maker is parting ways with Keebler, Famous Amos and various fruit snacks businesses.  Kellogg (NYSE:K) last year said that it was exploring the sale of some brands in order to refocus its operations.  Ferrero is the maker of Nutella among many other brands.  Kellogg (NYSE:K) lost more than 2 percent today to $56.02.</p><p>And Cal-Maine reported better than expected earnings and revenue.  The company pointed to a strong demand for eggs led by a specialty business.  Cal-Maine`s increase, though, in revenue comes despite a drop in egg prices.  Shares were off about 3 percent today to $43.27.</p><p>HERERA:  March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau fell slightly but it was higher than analysts had expected, and that was good news for Wynn Reports, which is estimated to get nearly 70 percent of its revenue from that region.  And shares rose more than 8 percent to $129.34.</p><p>ComScore`s CEO and president are both stepping down.  According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", the chief executive cited, quote, irreconcilable differences with the board over the company`s strategy and execution.  Both executives have been at the company less than a year.  A current director will serves as interim CEO.  But ComScore lost nearly 30 percent today.</p><p>And PG&amp;E may not be able to resume dividend payments to shareholders right away.  A federal judge wants California`s largest utility to trim hundreds of thousands of trees near its power lines before it can give money back to its investors.  The cases related to a 2010 natural gas explosion which killed eight people.  The judge oversees PGE`s probation in that case.  PG&amp;E gained 1 percent to $18.01.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  To the housing market now.  As you may know, mortgage rates fell sharply last week, potentially creating a very big opportunity for a lot of homeowners carrying a mortgage.</p><p>Diana Olick has the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  America`s homeowners just saw the biggest one-week mortgage rate drop in a decade.  The average on the 30-year fixed fell to nearly 4 percent, which meant 4.9 million borrowers could likely qualify for a refinance and reduce their interest rate by at least three-quarters of a percentage point according to Black Knight.  That was nearly a 50 percent increase in the number of those who could benefit.</p><p>Of course, it`s important to factor in closing costs which would be amortized over the length of the loan.  For someone not intending to stay in the home for more than a few years, a refi might not save them enough, but for nose planning on staying on a $300,000 mortgage, refinancing from 4.81 percent to 4.06 percent would save the homeowner about $133 a month 4.06 percent would save the homeowner about $133 per month.</p><p>On $600,000 loan, it would be twice that, or $267 per month.  It was a boon not just to borrowers but to lenders as well.  Not only was call volume higher last week for those in mortgage business, but lenders were reaching out to clients, making sure they knew of a potential savings.</p><p>Mortgage rates are popping higher again today as the bond market sells off, which just goes to show how volatile this market is.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the bipartisan effort to change some popular savings plans and to improve retirement security.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  When it comes to retirement, Americans are feeling more confident but they`re still worried.  According to a new survey from CNBC and financial technology firm Acorns, more than half of adults are somewhat more confident or much more confident about their retirement plans than they were just three years ago, and yet saving for retirement ranks as the overall top personal finance concern.  And that`s especially true for those between the ages of 45 and 64.</p><p>By the way, NBCUniversal and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) ventures are investors in Acorns.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC, which produces this program.</p><p>HERERA:  Today starts financial literacy month.  It was established in 2003 to teach Americans how to learn and maintain healthy financial habits.</p><p>But with retirement as a top concern, we asked Bob Pisani to take a look at how much Americans have really saved.  As he reports, it`s not a pretty picture.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Do you know where your retirement is?  Americans can certainly use help, baby boomers in particular, that`s me.  We`ve not saved nearly enough for retirement.  We`re going to live longer than most of us think and if the trends continue, some of us are going to run out of money before we die.</p><p>Just look at the state of the three legs of the retirement stool.  You got private savings, you got pensions and you have Social Security.</p><p>Let`s start with the private savings.  At Vanguard, the average 401(k) account for an investor who`s 65 years old and up was just under $193,000 in 2018, but that a number is inflated by a small group of super savers.  The median balance, half have more, half have less, for the age group, it`s $58,000 for a 65-year-old.</p><p>Try averaging that over 20 years, say.  Most Americans are expected to live into their 80s, remember, so you`re not pulling out a lot on a yearly basis, 5 percent of that maybe a year, $3,000.</p><p>Let`s look at pensions.  The state of those who have pensions aren`t much better.  The median private pension last year was only about $9,000 a year.  Finally, Social Security, in 2018, average social security check about $1,400 a month.  Let`s say that`s $17,000 a year.</p><p>So, let`s add all this up.  What do we have?  We get just a little more than $29,000 a year.  But it`s certainly possible to live on $29,000 a year, particularly if you live in a relatively low-cost part of the country.</p><p>But it`s hardly a robust retirement.  And remember something, these are the lucky ones.  A study but the St. Louis Federal Reserve found that only 27 percent of households have a defined benefit plan, as a pension plan.  And only one-third have a defined contribution plan.  That`s like a 401(k).  That`s not a lot of people.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, as it happens, retirement may be one area where Republicans and Democrats in Congress can actually agree, and they`re working together to make changes to some very popular savings plans.</p><p>Ylan Mui has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tomorrow, Congress will begin debating the biggest piece of retirement legislation in more than a decade.  And it actually stands a pretty good chance of becoming law.  It`s called Secure Act and the goal is to expand access to private retirement savings, especially for people who work in small businesses.</p><p>PAUL RICHMAN, INCOME RETIREMENT INSTITUTE:  It`s packaging them all into a comprehensive piece of legislation that would address many of these little issues that have cropped up over the years where solutions have been offered to try to increase the ability of workers to save for their retirement.</p><p>MUI:  This bill allows small businesses so band together, to offer 401(k) plans to their employees.  It repeals the maximum age for IRA contributions, which is currently 70-1/2.  It also requires companies to allow long-term, part-time workers to participate in 401(k) plans.  It also lets you withdraw from your IRA for a birth or an adoption without a penalty.</p><p>And there`s a provision that expands the use of 529s to pay for home schooling or private schools or even to pay off your student loans.  The House Ways and Means Committee will take up this bill tomorrow and it`s got the backing to top Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>GOP Congressman Mike Kelly is one of the co-sponsors.</p><p>REP. MIKE KELLY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  We were sent here by our folks in back home to act in their best interest, not our best interest or our party`s but in the best interest of the people, which to me is the real reason all of us come to Washington to serve.</p><p>MUI:  The Senate has been working on a similar proposal.  Experts are calling it practical, commonsense legislation.</p><p>SHAI AKABAS, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER:  This is the next important step in the process that is Congress, but I think there`s a lot of optimism to getting something across the finish line later this year.</p><p>MUI:  This could be a rare example of successful bipartisanship amid divided government.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a final look at the day on Wall Street.  The Dow gained 329 points to 26,258, the Nasdaq added 99 and the S&amp;P was up 32.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making this its second setback in a week. And should investors be concerned?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Class divide. Google's long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without controversy. What the change in shares means for investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Plot twist. Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake. But there may also be hope for the struggling bookseller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, April 3rd.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, it's undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking practices. And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi's plan to raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand.</p><p>Now, the bank's troubles just got worse. The FBI has reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the bank's role in a $400 million fraud involving its Mexican banking unit. Investors have taken notice, sending shares down another 1 percent today.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The FBI is investigating Citigroup's bank in Mexico, Banamex, once considered Citi's crowned jewel. Banamex is now a big problem for Citi. The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil services company in Mexico.</p><p>Even before today's news of a criminal investigation, analysts questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citi failed to pass the federal reserve's most recent stress test.</p><p>DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY: We have a sell on Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door without basically, you know, stopping it.</p><p>So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in place.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The lack of control from the top has some analysts calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p>MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST: John Gerspach, the CFO, was the chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps. Two years ago, Citi was turned down for its capital plan by the Fed. That's strike two. Then, yesterday, being turned down again is strike three.</p><p>Three strikes you're out. I think Citi needs to replace the CFO.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: Also at the center of the controversy, Citi's co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora. Medina Mora has been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at Banamex.</p><p>Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a company is just too big.</p><p>John Reed, former Citi chairman, said at a conference earlier this week that the company was so immense and complex, it's nearly impossible to manage.</p><p>Still, Citi has its defenders on Wall Street.</p><p>ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: I would be buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive. A lot of concern in the marketplace already baked in. We have a couple of catalysts coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think there's still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The question for Citi, how much more bad news investors are willing to take.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Let's turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi. He's managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p>So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation on Citi. You've downgraded it to neutral. Tell us why. And neutral still sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p>TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, I don't know if I'd say there's hope there. But basically as was reported in the story, the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly.</p><p>As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly surrounding the money laundering. I would expect that regulatory action is going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation. But more importantly, you've got a company where their expenses remain very elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that they're little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in the near future.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, you're going to have a protracted legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the sidelines and keep pressure on the stock.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don't mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn't put a sell on that stock and get the heck away from it. Why not? I don't get it.</p><p>HAGERMAN: Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a step back and look at the situation. The earnings have come down on this stock the last three to four consecutive quarters. There's a lot that's already heavily discounted in the shares right now.</p><p>Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed's capital review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and management. But if you look at the valuation today, there's a lot discounted. I don't think there's a lot of downside here in the stock. By the same token, I think, you know, I really can't see much upside from here. I just think it's status quo for a period of time.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, Citi has been under the gun for so long now, and the story we were just reporting it was the point that it's just not enough control at Citibank.</p><p>Is Citi just too big, too complex, too hard to manage?</p><p>HAGERMAN: You know, that's an argument that goes back to John Reed as you reference in your story. This is a very large, complex organization.</p><p>And I would have to agree. No single individual is capable of managing this company. It's been proven time and time again.</p><p>We're starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the last few years. And, you know, it's a very challenging operation when you have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to Latin America. Very difficult.</p><p>And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding your control mechanism within an organization like that.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Lots to talk about here.</p><p>Thank you so much, Todd. Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at Sterne Agee.</p><p>And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine for it. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card protection services they didn't need. The bank will pay the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million.</p><p>MATHISEN: It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall Street today, at least not for the full day.</p><p>Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in all-time record high territory for awhile there. Today's driver growth in the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time jobless claims last week and a jump nation's trade deficit in February prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow's big March market employment report.</p><p>At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a point lower. The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology shares. And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday's record close.</p><p>GHARIB: Now, if you're you were following shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren't seeing double. This was the first day of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock. There was class A and class C. And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares of both classes rose but only by a fraction.</p><p>So, what's behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p>Josh Lipton explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Google's motto is, \"don't be evil\". Another motto could be, \"don't share the power\". In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights.</p><p>Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, class A shares carry voting rights. If you own one share of class A stock, you have one vote. But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10 votes for each share. The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them control over the company's future.</p><p>Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock carries no voting rights. Why do this? Because it means Brin and Page cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make acquisitions without giving up any control of the company.</p><p>TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: It does protect their long-term control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But I think if you look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), they've really had control from day one. They did have the initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction. Investors did incredibly well if you adjust for this move you're basically looking at a $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600.</p><p>LIPTON: What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) investor? Not much. The value of their stock hasn't changed. They just now own two classes of shares instead of one.</p><p>Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the social network's class B stock, which is mostly owned by CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights.</p><p>In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a shopping spree. The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past year.</p><p>(on camera): Google's founders have shown they have the desire for acquisitions both large and small. Now, they have a new way to satisfy that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant.</p><p>Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty ignition switches it made. They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths. Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi's name in their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident. Shares of the auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today. They tumbled nearly 14 percent after one of the bookstore's chains biggest investors --- we're talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the company.</p><p>Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). Liberty Media's decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company, settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut.</p><p>Today's stock plunge has investors concerned about the company's future. But analysts say there's still plenty to be hopeful about.</p><p>JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST: This is definitely a short turn negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). It's taken away a stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position. But that said, they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman of 26 percent who being considering going private. Most importantly, you still have a stock that's very inexpensive.</p><p>BRENNAN: Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble's revenue strength and ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that's driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores.</p><p>TINKER: I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong print sales have been. And ironically, there have been complaints in New York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they like to go to bookstores. It's very different from a lot of the other businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium. There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones still actually wanting to read print books.</p><p>So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from that investment.</p><p>Then, there's the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on. Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: A big development over allegations of rigged markets because of high frequency trading which we've been telling you about all this week. Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology.</p><p>MATHISEN: Strong words about high frequency trading creating an unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab today. In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\" He said traders using that technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO GAP) in profits in the process.</p><p>GHARIB: And here's another hot button issue back in the news, executive compensation. This time, Coca-Cola's in the spotlight on how much it pays its top executives. At a time when the stock price has fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing.</p><p>Sara Eisen has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of its investors over executive pay.</p><p>David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke's 2014 equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the next few years. He says it's overly generous at the expense of shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14 percent to 16 percent.</p><p>DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO: When you look at it realistically, there's an awful lot of money being transferred from the shareholders' pockets to management of the company that's not growing very fast. It's just not right. We think it's wrong.</p><p>EISEN: Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke's stock has sent letters to coke's board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett, who's Coke's top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan.</p><p>But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math simply does not add up.</p><p>GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL: A lot of these awards are very dependent on stock price. Our investors really like that, because management doesn't get paid unless the company performs, and unless our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p>EISEN: CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed. Winters is also questioning Kent's role as chairman f the board, saying it's a conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive compensation. Coke rejects that idea as well.</p><p>BOWDEN: Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is the right structure for our company. And it's important to note that compensation committee sets the compensation for our company. So the compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. So, there's not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p>EISEN (on camera): Executive compensation has always been a hot topic for shareholders. No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett. Shares will get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a vote. Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their heels.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that is where we begin tonight's market focus. The chip maker reported better than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company helped results. Better memory always helps.</p><p>Shares were up initially after hours. The stock ended the regular session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there.</p><p>Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews. The Federal Trade Commission revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review site over the past five years. And according to an article in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to advertise on the site. Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61.</p><p>Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the biggest environmental settlement on record. It will pay more than $5 billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox. This was a supplier of paint materials. The government suit was asking for $25 billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company's Kerr-McGee unit. Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and shares surged 14 percent to $99.</p><p>Perry Ellis' shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a fourth quarter loss. The company says it's disappointed with the results and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls. But earnings did end up topping estimates, and that's what investors focused on. The stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p>And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade. Piper Jaffray lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target to $3 from $8. The firm's site is concerned over the outlook for the company's anti-obesity drug. Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2 percent to $5.83.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the Labor Department's all important march employment report. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only 34,000 layoffs in March. That's a good number unless you're one of the 34,000. That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more people don't consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class. This week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Americans continue to ask the question, where are the jobs? And too many middle class families and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p>PEARSON: Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a hire minimum wage.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES: The economy increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they're working harder but their wages, their incomes aren't going up.</p><p>PEARSON: But five years after the end of the great recession and the loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more people who believe the middle class is disappearing. From the Pew Research Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class. Now, it's just 44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four years.</p><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap. The wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in income over the last 30 years.</p><p>And there's even been a spike in those who identify themselves as lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey. Expert researchers across the country say those social standing trends are accelerating to the down side.</p><p>PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH: Median household income, which is perhaps the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak that it had pre-recession. Indeed, it hasn't returned to its peak in 1999.</p><p>So there's been 15 years of economic stagnation. People live that. They experience that. They also live the growing economic inequality and insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape.</p><p>PEARSON: There is an impact on the main street economy. People who feel they've slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less.</p><p>TAYLER: Today, they're much more sober in their spending habits. And that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera): Another factor in the erosion of the middle class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by 200,000. There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work for six months or longer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and healthy really feel about paying for health insurance. And why it's such a challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Another large group of Americans has found a different way to save money on medical coverage. Young millennials are opting to stay on their parents' insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their own.</p><p>Bertha Coombs explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account executive was a lesson in sticker shock.</p><p>JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE: There's going to be $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p>COOMBS: The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get coverage on his dad's insurance.</p><p>LUNDEEN: He managed to work it out with his company and basically just get me covered without any extra cost to him. So, at that point, the calculation was very easy to make. It was oh, I can pay for health insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn't cost him anything and doesn't cost me anything until I'm 26.</p><p>COOMBS: More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route, according to new data from payroll processor ADP. Since 2010, workers under 30 at the nation's largest companies saw their eligibility for insurance rise over 4 percent. Yet their rate of enrollment in company plans dropped over 7.5 percent. ADP officials say for many, the core issue is cost.</p><p>DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP: Certainly when you look at this population of under 30, they're at the beginning of their careers and their salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations.</p><p>COOMBS: Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their plans to offset the costs of older workers. To engage them they need to focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth policy advocate Jen Mishory.</p><p>JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR: Young people, mental health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people really need and value.</p><p>COOMBS (on camera): We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA. Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans.</p><p>Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p>(voice-over): Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next year, but he'll likely opt for coverage.</p><p>LUNDEEN: I will buy it. But perhaps a little grudgingly.</p><p>COOMBS: Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: To read more about young millennials and how they're dealing with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, a renovation that's nearly 40 years in the making. Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian's really wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30 million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year project, Charles Lindbergh's spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the Atlantic, John Glen's mercury capsule from NASA's first earth orbit and the centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon landing in 1969.</p><p>Now, don't worry if you're planning a trip this summer. The museum will be open during the renovations. It is a favorite especially for young kids.</p><p>GHARIB: Sounds fantastic.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.</p><p>I won't see you here tomorrow. I'm off. But she will.</p><p>GHARIB: I'll be here with Bill Griffin.</p><p>MATHISEN: We'll see you then.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making  this its second setback in a week.  And should investors be concerned? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Class divide.   Google's long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without  controversy.  What the change in shares means for investors. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  Plot twist.  Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS)  plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake.  But there may also be hope for  the struggling bookseller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Thursday, April 3rd. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Thanks for joining  us. </p><p>Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was  bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis.  Since then, it's  undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about  dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money  laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking  practices.  And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi's plan to  raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on  concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand. </p><p>Now, the bank's troubles just got worse.  The FBI has reportedly  launched a criminal investigation into the bank's role in a $400 million  fraud involving its Mexican banking unit.  Investors have taken notice,  sending shares down another 1 percent today. </p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about  Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The FBI is investigating Citigroup's bank in Mexico, Banamex, once  considered Citi's crowned jewel.  Banamex is now a big problem for Citi.   The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil  services company in Mexico. </p><p>Even before today's news of a criminal investigation, analysts  questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citi failed to pass the  federal reserve's most recent stress test.</p><p>DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY:  We have a sell on  Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty  tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a  result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door  without basically, you know, stopping it. </p><p>So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come  down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in  place.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA:  The lack of control from the top has some analysts  calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p>MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST:  John Gerspach, the CFO, was the  chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup  (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps.  Two years ago, Citi was turned down for  its capital plan by the Fed.  That's strike two.  Then, yesterday, being  turned down again is strike three. </p><p>Three strikes you're out.  I think Citi needs to replace the CFO. </p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA:  Also at the center of the controversy, Citi's co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora.  Medina Mora has  been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most  recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at  Banamex.</p><p>Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a  company is just too big.</p><p>John Reed, former Citi chairman, said at a conference earlier this  week that the company was so immense and complex, it's nearly impossible to  manage. </p><p>Still, Citi has its defenders on Wall Street. </p><p>ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  I would be  buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive.  A lot of  concern in the marketplace already baked in.  We have a couple of catalysts  coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think  there's still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track. </p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA:  The question for Citi, how much more bad news  investors are willing to take.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Let's turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi.   He's managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p>So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation  on Citi.  You've downgraded it to neutral.  Tell us why.  And neutral still  sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p>TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Well, I don't know if  I'd say there's hope there.  But basically as was reported in the story,  the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really  underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly. </p><p>As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly  surrounding the money laundering.  I would expect that regulatory action is  going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation.  But more  importantly, you've got a company where their expenses remain very  elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that  they're little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of  settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors  questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in  the near future.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, you're going to have a protracted  legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the  sidelines and keep pressure on the stock. </p><p>MATHISEN:  I don't mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to  me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn't put a sell on that stock  and get the heck away from it.  Why not?  I don't get it.</p><p>HAGERMAN:  Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a  step back and look at the situation.  The earnings have come down on this  stock the last three to four consecutive quarters.  There's a lot that's  already heavily discounted in the shares right now. </p><p>Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed's capital  review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and  management.  But if you look at the valuation today, there's a lot  discounted.  I don't think there's a lot of downside here in the stock.  By  the same token, I think, you know, I really can't see much upside from  here.  I just think it's status quo for a period of time. </p><p>GHARIB:  You know, Citi has been under the gun for so long now, and  the story we were just reporting it was the point that it's just not enough  control at Citibank. </p><p>Is Citi just too big, too complex, too hard to manage? </p><p>HAGERMAN:  You know, that's an argument that goes back to John Reed as  you reference in your story.  This is a very large, complex organization. </p><p>And I would have to agree.  No single individual is capable of  managing this company.  It's been proven time and time again. </p><p>We're starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the  last few years.  And, you know, it's a very challenging operation when you  have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to  Latin America.  Very difficult. </p><p>And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding  your control mechanism within an organization like that. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Lots to talk about here. </p><p>Thank you so much, Todd.  Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at  Sterne Agee.</p><p>And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine  for it.  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle  allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card  protection services they didn't need.  The bank will pay the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million. </p><p>MATHISEN:  It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall  Street today, at least not for the full day. </p><p>Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in  all-time record high territory for awhile there.  Today's driver growth in  the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time  jobless claims last week and a jump nation's trade deficit in February  prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow's big March market employment report. </p><p>At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a  point lower.  The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology  shares.  And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday's record close. </p><p>GHARIB:  Now, if you're you were following shares of Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren't seeing double.  This was the first day  of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock.  There  was class A and class C.  And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares  of both classes rose but only by a fraction. </p><p>So, what's behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p>Josh Lipton explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Google's motto is, \"don't be evil\".  Another motto could be, \"don't share  the power\".  In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the  direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights. </p><p>Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  stock, class A shares carry voting rights.  If you own one share of class A  stock, you have one vote.  But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page  maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10  votes for each share.  The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive  chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them  control over the company's future. </p><p>Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock  carries no voting rights.  Why do this?  Because it means Brin and Page  cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make  acquisitions without giving up any control of the company. </p><p>TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP:  It does protect their long-term  control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  But I think if you look at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), they've really had control from day one.  They did have the  initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction.  Investors did  incredibly well if you adjust for this move you're basically looking at a  $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600. </p><p>LIPTON:  What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  investor?  Not much.  The value of their stock hasn't changed.  They just  now own two classes of shares instead of one. </p><p>Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock  include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), the social network's class B stock, which is mostly owned by  CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights. </p><p>In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a  shopping spree.  The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for  $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past  year.</p><p>(on camera):  Google's founders have shown they have the desire for  acquisitions both large and small.  Now, they have a new way to satisfy  that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant. </p><p>Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that  massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty  ignition switches it made.  They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths.  Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi's name in  their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee  whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident.  Shares of the  auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares  of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today.  They tumbled nearly 14  percent after one of the bookstore's chains biggest investors --- we're  talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the  company. </p><p>Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble  (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS).   Liberty Media's decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three  years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company,  settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut. </p><p>Today's stock plunge has investors concerned about the company's  future.  But analysts say there's still plenty to be hopeful about. </p><p>JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST:  This is definitely a short turn  negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS).  It's taken away a  stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position.  But that said,  they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman  of 26 percent who being considering going private.  Most importantly, you  still have a stock that's very inexpensive. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble's revenue strength and  ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that's  driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores. </p><p>TINKER:  I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong  print sales have been.  And ironically, there have been complaints in New  York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they  like to go to bookstores.  It's very different from a lot of the other  businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium.   There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones  still actually wanting to read print books. </p><p>So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera):  Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts  many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the  financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from  that investment. </p><p>Then, there's the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on.  Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been  losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the  battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  A big development over allegations of rigged markets because  of high frequency trading which we've been telling you about all this week.   Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now  giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades  using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX  trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Strong words about high frequency trading creating an  unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab  today.  In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a  growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\"  He said traders using that  technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO  GAP) in profits in the process. </p><p>GHARIB:  And here's another hot button issue back in the news,  executive compensation.  This time, Coca-Cola's in the spotlight on how  much it pays its top executives.  At a time when the stock price has  fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing. </p><p>Sara Eisen has the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of  its investors over executive pay.</p><p>David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke's 2014  equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the  next few years.  He says it's overly generous at the expense of  shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14  percent to 16 percent. </p><p>DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO:  When you look at it  realistically, there's an awful lot of money being transferred from the  shareholders' pockets to management of the company that's not growing very  fast.  It's just not right.  We think it's wrong.</p><p>EISEN:  Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke's stock has sent  letters to coke's board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett,  who's Coke's top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan. </p><p>But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math  simply does not add up.  </p><p>GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL:  A lot of these  awards are very dependent on stock price.  Our investors really like that,  because management doesn't get paid unless the company performs, and unless  our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p>EISEN:  CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more  than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed.  Winters is  also questioning Kent's role as chairman f the board, saying it's a  conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive  compensation.  Coke rejects that idea as well. </p><p>BOWDEN:  Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is  the right structure for our company.  And it's important to note that  compensation committee sets the compensation for our company.  So the  compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors.  So,  there's not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p>EISEN (on camera):  Executive compensation has always been a hot topic  for shareholders.  No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett.  Shares will  get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a  vote.  Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their  heels. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that  is where we begin tonight's market focus.  The chip maker reported better  than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger  recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company  helped results.  Better memory always helps. </p><p>Shares were up initially after hours.  The stock ended the regular  session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there. </p><p>Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews.  The Federal Trade Commission  revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review  site over the past five years.  And according to an article in the \"Wall  Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that  claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to  advertise on the site.  Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61. </p><p>Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the  biggest environmental settlement on record.  It will pay more than $5  billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox.  This  was a supplier of paint materials.  The government suit was asking for $25  billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company's  Kerr-McGee unit.  Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and  shares surged 14 percent to $99. </p><p>Perry Ellis' shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a  fourth quarter loss.  The company says it's disappointed with the results  and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls.  But earnings  did end up topping estimates, and that's what investors focused on.  The  stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p>And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade.  Piper Jaffray  lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target  to $3 from $8.  The firm's site is concerned over the outlook for the  company's anti-obesity drug.  Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2  percent to $5.83.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the  Labor Department's all important march employment report.  The outplacement  firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only  34,000 layoffs in March.  That's a good number unless you're one of the  34,000.  That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first  quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low. </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major  stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more  people don't consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the  American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach. </p><p>Hampton Pearson has more. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class.  This  week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Americans continue to  ask the question, where are the jobs?  And too many middle class families  and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p>PEARSON:  Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a  hire minimum wage.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES:  The economy  increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class  families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they're  working harder but their wages, their incomes aren't going up. </p><p>PEARSON:  But five years after the end of the great recession and the  loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more  people who believe the middle class is disappearing.  From the Pew Research  Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class.  Now, it's just  44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four  years. </p><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap.  The  wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in  income over the last 30 years. </p><p>And there's even been a spike in those who identify themselves as  lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey.  Expert  researchers across the country say those social standing trends are  accelerating to the down side. </p><p>PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH:  Median household income, which is perhaps  the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak  that it had pre-recession.  Indeed, it hasn't returned to its peak in 1999.  </p><p>So there's been 15 years of economic stagnation.  People live that.   They experience that.  They also live the growing economic inequality and  insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape. </p><p>PEARSON:  There is an impact on the main street economy.  People who  feel they've slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less. </p><p>TAYLER:  Today, they're much more sober in their spending habits.  And  that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of  which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera):  Another factor in the erosion of the middle  class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by  200,000.  There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work  for six months or longer. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and  healthy really feel about paying for health insurance.  And why it's such a  challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  Another large group of Americans has found a different way to  save money on medical coverage.  Young millennials are opting to stay on  their parents' insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their  own. </p><p>Bertha Coombs explains. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account  executive was a lesson in sticker shock. </p><p>JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE:  There's going to be  $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p>COOMBS:  The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his  employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get  coverage on his dad's insurance. </p><p>LUNDEEN:  He managed to work it out with his company and basically  just get me covered without any extra cost to him.  So, at that point, the  calculation was very easy to make.  It was oh, I can pay for health  insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn't cost  him anything and doesn't cost me anything until I'm 26. </p><p>COOMBS:  More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route,  according to new data from payroll processor ADP.  Since 2010, workers  under 30 at the nation's largest companies saw their eligibility for  insurance rise over 4 percent.  Yet their rate of enrollment in company  plans dropped over 7.5 percent.  ADP officials say for many, the core issue  is cost. </p><p>DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP:  Certainly when you look at this  population of under 30, they're at the beginning of their careers and their  salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations. </p><p>COOMBS:  Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their  plans to offset the costs of older workers.  To engage them they need to  focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth  policy advocate Jen Mishory. </p><p>JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR:  Young people, mental  health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people  really need and value.  </p><p>COOMBS (on camera):  We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA.   Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans. </p><p>Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p>(voice-over):  Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next  year, but he'll likely opt for coverage. </p><p>LUNDEEN:  I will buy it.  But perhaps a little grudgingly. </p><p>COOMBS:  Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  To read more about young millennials and how they're dealing  with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, a renovation that's nearly 40 years in  the making.  Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and  space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian's really  wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30  million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA). </p><p>Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year  project, Charles Lindbergh's spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the  Atlantic, John Glen's mercury capsule from NASA's first earth orbit and the  centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon  landing in 1969. </p><p>Now, don't worry if you're planning a trip this summer.  The museum  will be open during the renovations.  It is a favorite especially for young  kids. </p><p>GHARIB:  Sounds fantastic. </p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making this its second setback in a week. And should investors be concerned?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Class divide. Google`s long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without controversy. What the change in shares means for investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Plot twist. Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake. But there may also be hope for the struggling bookseller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, April 3rd.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, it`s undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking practices. And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi`s plan to raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand.</p><p>Now, the bank`s troubles just got worse. The FBI has reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the bank`s role in a $400 million fraud involving its Mexican banking unit. Investors have taken notice, sending shares down another 1 percent today.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The FBI is investigating Citigroup`s bank in Mexico, Banamex, once considered Citi`s crowned jewel. Banamex is now a big problem for Citi. The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil services company in Mexico.</p><p>Even before today`s news of a criminal investigation, analysts questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citi failed to pass the federal reserve`s most recent stress test.</p><p>DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY: We have a sell on Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door without basically, you know, stopping it.</p><p>So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in place.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The lack of control from the top has some analysts calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p>MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST: John Gerspach, the CFO, was the chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps. Two years ago, Citi was turned down for its capital plan by the Fed. That`s strike two. Then, yesterday, being turned down again is strike three.</p><p>Three strikes you`re out. I think Citi needs to replace the CFO.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: Also at the center of the controversy, Citi`s co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora. Medina Mora has been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at Banamex.</p><p>Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a company is just too big.</p><p>John Reed, former Citi chairman, said at a conference earlier this week that the company was so immense and complex, it`s nearly impossible to manage.</p><p>Still, Citi has its defenders on Wall Street.</p><p>ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: I would be buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive. A lot of concern in the marketplace already baked in. We have a couple of catalysts coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think there`s still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The question for Citi, how much more bad news investors are willing to take.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi. He`s managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p>So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation on Citi. You`ve downgraded it to neutral. Tell us why. And neutral still sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p>TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, I don`t know if I`d say there`s hope there. But basically as was reported in the story, the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly.</p><p>As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly surrounding the money laundering. I would expect that regulatory action is going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation. But more importantly, you`ve got a company where their expenses remain very elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that they`re little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in the near future.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, you`re going to have a protracted legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the sidelines and keep pressure on the stock.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don`t mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn`t put a sell on that stock and get the heck away from it. Why not? I don`t get it.</p><p>HAGERMAN: Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a step back and look at the situation. The earnings have come down on this stock the last three to four consecutive quarters. There`s a lot that`s already heavily discounted in the shares right now.</p><p>Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed`s capital review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and management. But if you look at the valuation today, there`s a lot discounted. I don`t think there`s a lot of downside here in the stock. By the same token, I think, you know, I really can`t see much upside from here. I just think it`s status quo for a period of time.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, Citi has been under the gun for so long now, and the story we were just reporting it was the point that it`s just not enough control at Citibank.</p><p>Is Citi just too big, too complex, too hard to manage?</p><p>HAGERMAN: You know, that`s an argument that goes back to John Reed as you reference in your story. This is a very large, complex organization.</p><p>And I would have to agree. No single individual is capable of managing this company. It`s been proven time and time again.</p><p>We`re starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the last few years. And, you know, it`s a very challenging operation when you have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to Latin America. Very difficult.</p><p>And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding your control mechanism within an organization like that.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Lots to talk about here.</p><p>Thank you so much, Todd. Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at Sterne Agee.</p><p>And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine for it. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card protection services they didn`t need. The bank will pay the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million.</p><p>MATHISEN: It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall Street today, at least not for the full day.</p><p>Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in all-time record high territory for awhile there. Today`s driver growth in the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time jobless claims last week and a jump nation`s trade deficit in February prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow`s big March market employment report.</p><p>At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a point lower. The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology shares. And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday`s record close.</p><p>GHARIB: Now, if you`re you were following shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren`t seeing double. This was the first day of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock. There was class A and class C. And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares of both classes rose but only by a fraction.</p><p>So, what`s behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p>Josh Lipton explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Google`s motto is, \"don`t be evil\". Another motto could be, \"don`t share the power\". In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights.</p><p>Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, class A shares carry voting rights. If you own one share of class A stock, you have one vote. But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10 votes for each share. The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google`s executive chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them control over the company`s future.</p><p>Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock carries no voting rights. Why do this? Because it means Brin and Page cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make acquisitions without giving up any control of the company.</p><p>TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: It does protect their long-term control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But I think if you look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), they`ve really had control from day one. They did have the initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction. Investors did incredibly well if you adjust for this move you`re basically looking at a $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600.</p><p>LIPTON: What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) investor? Not much. The value of their stock hasn`t changed. They just now own two classes of shares instead of one.</p><p>Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the social network`s class B stock, which is mostly owned by CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights.</p><p>In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a shopping spree. The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past year.</p><p>(on camera): Google`s founders have shown they have the desire for acquisitions both large and small. Now, they have a new way to satisfy that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant.</p><p>Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty ignition switches it made. They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths. Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi`s name in their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident. Shares of the auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today. They tumbled nearly 14 percent after one of the bookstore`s chains biggest investors --- we`re talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the company.</p><p>Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). Liberty Media`s decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company, settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut.</p><p>Today`s stock plunge has investors concerned about the company`s future. But analysts say there`s still plenty to be hopeful about.</p><p>JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST: This is definitely a short turn negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). It`s taken away a stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position. But that said, they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman of 26 percent who being considering going private. Most importantly, you still have a stock that`s very inexpensive.</p><p>BRENNAN: Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble`s revenue strength and ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that`s driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores.</p><p>TINKER: I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong print sales have been. And ironically, there have been complaints in New York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they like to go to bookstores. It`s very different from a lot of the other businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium. There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones still actually wanting to read print books.</p><p>So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from that investment.</p><p>Then, there`s the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on. Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: A big development over allegations of rigged markets because of high frequency trading which we`ve been telling you about all this week. Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology.</p><p>MATHISEN: Strong words about high frequency trading creating an unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab today. In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\" He said traders using that technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO GAP) in profits in the process.</p><p>GHARIB: And here`s another hot button issue back in the news, executive compensation. This time, Coca-Cola`s in the spotlight on how much it pays its top executives. At a time when the stock price has fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing.</p><p>Sara Eisen has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of its investors over executive pay.</p><p>David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke`s 2014 equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the next few years. He says it`s overly generous at the expense of shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14 percent to 16 percent.</p><p>DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO: When you look at it realistically, there`s an awful lot of money being transferred from the shareholders` pockets to management of the company that`s not growing very fast. It`s just not right. We think it`s wrong.</p><p>EISEN: Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke`s stock has sent letters to coke`s board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett, who`s Coke`s top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan.</p><p>But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math simply does not add up.</p><p>GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL: A lot of these awards are very dependent on stock price. Our investors really like that, because management doesn`t get paid unless the company performs, and unless our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p>EISEN: CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed. Winters is also questioning Kent`s role as chairman f the board, saying it`s a conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive compensation. Coke rejects that idea as well.</p><p>BOWDEN: Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is the right structure for our company. And it`s important to note that compensation committee sets the compensation for our company. So the compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. So, there`s not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p>EISEN (on camera): Executive compensation has always been a hot topic for shareholders. No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett. Shares will get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a vote. Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their heels.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that is where we begin tonight`s market focus. The chip maker reported better than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company helped results. Better memory always helps.</p><p>Shares were up initially after hours. The stock ended the regular session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there.</p><p>Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews. The Federal Trade Commission revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review site over the past five years. And according to an article in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to advertise on the site. Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61.</p><p>Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the biggest environmental settlement on record. It will pay more than $5 billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox. This was a supplier of paint materials. The government suit was asking for $25 billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company`s Kerr-McGee unit. Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and shares surged 14 percent to $99.</p><p>Perry Ellis` shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a fourth quarter loss. The company says it`s disappointed with the results and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls. But earnings did end up topping estimates, and that`s what investors focused on. The stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p>And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade. Piper Jaffray lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target to $3 from $8. The firm`s site is concerned over the outlook for the company`s anti-obesity drug. Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2 percent to $5.83.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the Labor Department`s all important march employment report. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only 34,000 layoffs in March. That`s a good number unless you`re one of the 34,000. That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more people don`t consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class. This week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Americans continue to ask the question, where are the jobs? And too many middle class families and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p>PEARSON: Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a hire minimum wage.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES: The economy increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they`re working harder but their wages, their incomes aren`t going up.</p><p>PEARSON: But five years after the end of the great recession and the loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more people who believe the middle class is disappearing. From the Pew Research Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class. Now, it`s just 44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four years.</p><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap. The wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in income over the last 30 years.</p><p>And there`s even been a spike in those who identify themselves as lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey. Expert researchers across the country say those social standing trends are accelerating to the down side.</p><p>PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH: Median household income, which is perhaps the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak that it had pre-recession. Indeed, it hasn`t returned to its peak in 1999.</p><p>So there`s been 15 years of economic stagnation. People live that. They experience that. They also live the growing economic inequality and insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape.</p><p>PEARSON: There is an impact on the main street economy. People who feel they`ve slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less.</p><p>TAYLER: Today, they`re much more sober in their spending habits. And that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera): Another factor in the erosion of the middle class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by 200,000. There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work for six months or longer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and healthy really feel about paying for health insurance. And why it`s such a challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Another large group of Americans has found a different way to save money on medical coverage. Young millennials are opting to stay on their parents` insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their own.</p><p>Bertha Coombs explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account executive was a lesson in sticker shock.</p><p>JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE: There`s going to be $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p>COOMBS: The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get coverage on his dad`s insurance.</p><p>LUNDEEN: He managed to work it out with his company and basically just get me covered without any extra cost to him. So, at that point, the calculation was very easy to make. It was oh, I can pay for health insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn`t cost him anything and doesn`t cost me anything until I`m 26.</p><p>COOMBS: More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route, according to new data from payroll processor ADP. Since 2010, workers under 30 at the nation`s largest companies saw their eligibility for insurance rise over 4 percent. Yet their rate of enrollment in company plans dropped over 7.5 percent. ADP officials say for many, the core issue is cost.</p><p>DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP: Certainly when you look at this population of under 30, they`re at the beginning of their careers and their salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations.</p><p>COOMBS: Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their plans to offset the costs of older workers. To engage them they need to focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth policy advocate Jen Mishory.</p><p>JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR: Young people, mental health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people really need and value.</p><p>COOMBS (on camera): We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA. Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans.</p><p>Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p>(voice-over): Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next year, but he`ll likely opt for coverage.</p><p>LUNDEEN: I will buy it. But perhaps a little grudgingly.</p><p>COOMBS: Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: To read more about young millennials and how they`re dealing with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, a renovation that`s nearly 40 years in the making. Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian`s really wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30 million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year project, Charles Lindbergh`s spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the Atlantic, John Glen`s mercury capsule from NASA`s first earth orbit and the centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon landing in 1969.</p><p>Now, don`t worry if you`re planning a trip this summer. The museum will be open during the renovations. It is a favorite especially for young kids.</p><p>GHARIB: Sounds fantastic.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.</p><p>I won`t see you here tomorrow. I`m off. But she will.</p><p>GHARIB: I`ll be here with Bill Griffin.</p><p>MATHISEN: We`ll see you then.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making  this its second setback in a week.  And should investors be concerned? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Class divide.   Google's long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without  controversy.  What the change in shares means for investors. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  Plot twist.  Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS)  plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake.  But there may also be hope for  the struggling bookseller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Thursday, April 3rd. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Thanks for joining  us. </p><p>  Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was  bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis.  Since then, it's  undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about  dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money  laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking  practices.  And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi's plan to  raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on  concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand. </p><p>  Now, the bank's troubles just got worse.  The FBI has reportedly  launched a criminal investigation into the bank's role in a $400 million  fraud involving its Mexican banking unit.  Investors have taken notice,  sending shares down another 1 percent today. </p><p>  Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about  Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The FBI is investigating Citigroup's bank in Mexico, Banamex, once  considered Citi's crowned jewel.  Banamex is now a big problem for Citi.   The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil  services company in Mexico. </p><p>  Even before today's news of a criminal investigation, analysts  questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citi failed to pass the  federal reserve's most recent stress test.</p><p>  DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY:  We have a sell on  Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty  tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a  result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door  without basically, you know, stopping it. </p><p>  So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come  down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in  place.</p><p>  CARUSO-CABRERA:  The lack of control from the top has some analysts  calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p>  MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST:  John Gerspach, the CFO, was the  chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup  (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps.  Two years ago, Citi was turned down for  its capital plan by the Fed.  That's strike two.  Then, yesterday, being  turned down again is strike three. </p><p>  Three strikes you're out.  I think Citi needs to replace the CFO. </p><p>  CARUSO-CABRERA:  Also at the center of the controversy, Citi's co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora.  Medina Mora has  been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most  recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at  Banamex.</p><p>  Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a  company is just too big.</p><p>  John Reed, former Citi chairman, said at a conference earlier this  week that the company was so immense and complex, it's nearly impossible to  manage. </p><p>  Still, Citi has its defenders on Wall Street. </p><p>  ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  I would be  buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive.  A lot of  concern in the marketplace already baked in.  We have a couple of catalysts  coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think  there's still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track. </p><p>  CARUSO-CABRERA:  The question for Citi, how much more bad news  investors are willing to take.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Let's turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi.   He's managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p>  So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation  on Citi.  You've downgraded it to neutral.  Tell us why.  And neutral still  sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p>  TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Well, I don't know if  I'd say there's hope there.  But basically as was reported in the story,  the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really  underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly. </p><p>  As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly  surrounding the money laundering.  I would expect that regulatory action is  going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation.  But more  importantly, you've got a company where their expenses remain very  elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that  they're little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of  settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors  questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in  the near future.</p><p>  So, I think at the end of the day, you're going to have a protracted  legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the  sidelines and keep pressure on the stock. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  I don't mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to  me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn't put a sell on that stock  and get the heck away from it.  Why not?  I don't get it.</p><p>  HAGERMAN:  Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a  step back and look at the situation.  The earnings have come down on this  stock the last three to four consecutive quarters.  There's a lot that's  already heavily discounted in the shares right now. </p><p>  Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed's capital  review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and  management.  But if you look at the valuation today, there's a lot  discounted.  I don't think there's a lot of downside here in the stock.  By  the same token, I think, you know, I really can't see much upside from  here.  I just think it's status quo for a period of time. </p><p>  GHARIB:  You know, Citi has been under the gun for so long now, and  the story we were just reporting it was the point that it's just not enough  control at Citibank. </p><p>  Is Citi just too big, too complex, too hard to manage? </p><p>  HAGERMAN:  You know, that's an argument that goes back to John Reed as  you reference in your story.  This is a very large, complex organization. </p><p>  And I would have to agree.  No single individual is capable of  managing this company.  It's been proven time and time again. </p><p>  We're starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the  last few years.  And, you know, it's a very challenging operation when you  have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to  Latin America.  Very difficult. </p><p>  And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding  your control mechanism within an organization like that. </p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  Lots to talk about here. </p><p>  Thank you so much, Todd.  Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at  Sterne Agee.</p><p>  And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine  for it.  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle  allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card  protection services they didn't need.  The bank will pay the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall  Street today, at least not for the full day. </p><p>  Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in  all-time record high territory for awhile there.  Today's driver growth in  the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time  jobless claims last week and a jump nation's trade deficit in February  prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow's big March market employment report. </p><p>  At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a  point lower.  The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology  shares.  And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday's record close. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Now, if you're you were following shares of Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren't seeing double.  This was the first day  of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock.  There  was class A and class C.  And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares  of both classes rose but only by a fraction. </p><p>  So, what's behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p>  Josh Lipton explains.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Google's motto is, \"don't be evil\".  Another motto could be, \"don't share  the power\".  In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the  direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights. </p><p>  Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  stock, class A shares carry voting rights.  If you own one share of class A  stock, you have one vote.  But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page  maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10  votes for each share.  The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive  chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them  control over the company's future. </p><p>  Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock  carries no voting rights.  Why do this?  Because it means Brin and Page  cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make  acquisitions without giving up any control of the company. </p><p>  TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP:  It does protect their long-term  control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  But I think if you look at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), they've really had control from day one.  They did have the  initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction.  Investors did  incredibly well if you adjust for this move you're basically looking at a  $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600. </p><p>  LIPTON:  What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  investor?  Not much.  The value of their stock hasn't changed.  They just  now own two classes of shares instead of one. </p><p>  Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock  include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), the social network's class B stock, which is mostly owned by  CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights. </p><p>  In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a  shopping spree.  The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for  $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past  year.</p><p>  (on camera):  Google's founders have shown they have the desire for  acquisitions both large and small.  Now, they have a new way to satisfy  that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant. </p><p>  Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that  massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty  ignition switches it made.  They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths.  Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi's name in  their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee  whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident.  Shares of the  auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares  of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today.  They tumbled nearly 14  percent after one of the bookstore's chains biggest investors --- we're  talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the  company. </p><p>  Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble  (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS).   Liberty Media's decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three  years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company,  settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut. </p><p>  Today's stock plunge has investors concerned about the company's  future.  But analysts say there's still plenty to be hopeful about. </p><p>  JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST:  This is definitely a short turn  negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS).  It's taken away a  stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position.  But that said,  they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman  of 26 percent who being considering going private.  Most importantly, you  still have a stock that's very inexpensive. </p><p>  BRENNAN:  Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble's revenue strength and  ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that's  driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores. </p><p>  TINKER:  I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong  print sales have been.  And ironically, there have been complaints in New  York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they  like to go to bookstores.  It's very different from a lot of the other  businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium.   There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones  still actually wanting to read print books. </p><p>  So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p>  BRENNAN (on camera):  Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts  many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the  financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from  that investment. </p><p>  Then, there's the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on.  Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been  losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the  battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up. </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  A big development over allegations of rigged markets because  of high frequency trading which we've been telling you about all this week.   Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now  giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades  using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX  trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Strong words about high frequency trading creating an  unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab  today.  In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a  growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\"  He said traders using that  technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO  GAP) in profits in the process. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And here's another hot button issue back in the news,  executive compensation.  This time, Coca-Cola's in the spotlight on how  much it pays its top executives.  At a time when the stock price has  fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing. </p><p>  Sara Eisen has the story. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of  its investors over executive pay.</p><p>  David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke's 2014  equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the  next few years.  He says it's overly generous at the expense of  shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14  percent to 16 percent. </p><p>  DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO:  When you look at it  realistically, there's an awful lot of money being transferred from the  shareholders' pockets to management of the company that's not growing very  fast.  It's just not right.  We think it's wrong.</p><p>  EISEN:  Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke's stock has sent  letters to coke's board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett,  who's Coke's top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan. </p><p>  But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math  simply does not add up.  </p><p>  GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL:  A lot of these  awards are very dependent on stock price.  Our investors really like that,  because management doesn't get paid unless the company performs, and unless  our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p>  EISEN:  CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more  than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed.  Winters is  also questioning Kent's role as chairman f the board, saying it's a  conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive  compensation.  Coke rejects that idea as well. </p><p>  BOWDEN:  Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is  the right structure for our company.  And it's important to note that  compensation committee sets the compensation for our company.  So the  compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors.  So,  there's not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p>  EISEN (on camera):  Executive compensation has always been a hot topic  for shareholders.  No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett.  Shares will  get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a  vote.  Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their  heels. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that  is where we begin tonight's market focus.  The chip maker reported better  than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger  recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company  helped results.  Better memory always helps. </p><p>  Shares were up initially after hours.  The stock ended the regular  session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there. </p><p>  Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews.  The Federal Trade Commission  revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review  site over the past five years.  And according to an article in the \"Wall  Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that  claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to  advertise on the site.  Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61. </p><p>  Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the  biggest environmental settlement on record.  It will pay more than $5  billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox.  This  was a supplier of paint materials.  The government suit was asking for $25  billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company's  Kerr-McGee unit.  Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and  shares surged 14 percent to $99. </p><p>  Perry Ellis' shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a  fourth quarter loss.  The company says it's disappointed with the results  and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls.  But earnings  did end up topping estimates, and that's what investors focused on.  The  stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p>  And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade.  Piper Jaffray  lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target  to $3 from $8.  The firm's site is concerned over the outlook for the  company's anti-obesity drug.  Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2  percent to $5.83.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the  Labor Department's all important march employment report.  The outplacement  firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only  34,000 layoffs in March.  That's a good number unless you're one of the  34,000.  That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first  quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major  stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more  people don't consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the  American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach. </p><p>  Hampton Pearson has more. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class.  This  week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p>  REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Americans continue to  ask the question, where are the jobs?  And too many middle class families  and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p>  PEARSON:  Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a  hire minimum wage.</p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES:  The economy  increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class  families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they're  working harder but their wages, their incomes aren't going up. </p><p>  PEARSON:  But five years after the end of the great recession and the  loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more  people who believe the middle class is disappearing.  From the Pew Research  Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class.  Now, it's just  44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four  years. </p><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap.  The  wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in  income over the last 30 years. </p><p>  And there's even been a spike in those who identify themselves as  lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey.  Expert  researchers across the country say those social standing trends are  accelerating to the down side. </p><p>  PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH:  Median household income, which is perhaps  the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak  that it had pre-recession.  Indeed, it hasn't returned to its peak in 1999.  </p><p>  So there's been 15 years of economic stagnation.  People live that.   They experience that.  They also live the growing economic inequality and  insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape. </p><p>  PEARSON:  There is an impact on the main street economy.  People who  feel they've slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less. </p><p>  TAYLER:  Today, they're much more sober in their spending habits.  And  that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of  which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p>  PEARSON (on camera):  Another factor in the erosion of the middle  class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by  200,000.  There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work  for six months or longer. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and  healthy really feel about paying for health insurance.  And why it's such a  challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Another large group of Americans has found a different way to  save money on medical coverage.  Young millennials are opting to stay on  their parents' insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their  own. </p><p>  Bertha Coombs explains. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account  executive was a lesson in sticker shock. </p><p>  JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE:  There's going to be  $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p>  COOMBS:  The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his  employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get  coverage on his dad's insurance. </p><p>  LUNDEEN:  He managed to work it out with his company and basically  just get me covered without any extra cost to him.  So, at that point, the  calculation was very easy to make.  It was oh, I can pay for health  insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn't cost  him anything and doesn't cost me anything until I'm 26. </p><p>  COOMBS:  More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route,  according to new data from payroll processor ADP.  Since 2010, workers  under 30 at the nation's largest companies saw their eligibility for  insurance rise over 4 percent.  Yet their rate of enrollment in company  plans dropped over 7.5 percent.  ADP officials say for many, the core issue  is cost. </p><p>  DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP:  Certainly when you look at this  population of under 30, they're at the beginning of their careers and their  salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations. </p><p>  COOMBS:  Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their  plans to offset the costs of older workers.  To engage them they need to  focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth  policy advocate Jen Mishory. </p><p>  JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR:  Young people, mental  health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people  really need and value.  </p><p>  COOMBS (on camera):  We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA.   Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans. </p><p>  Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p>  (voice-over):  Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next  year, but he'll likely opt for coverage. </p><p>  LUNDEEN:  I will buy it.  But perhaps a little grudgingly. </p><p>  COOMBS:  Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  To read more about young millennials and how they're dealing  with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, a renovation that's nearly 40 years in  the making.  Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and  space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian's really  wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30  million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA). </p><p>  Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year  project, Charles Lindbergh's spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the  Atlantic, John Glen's mercury capsule from NASA's first earth orbit and the  centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon  landing in 1969. </p><p>  Now, don't worry if you're planning a trip this summer.  The museum  will be open during the renovations.  It is a favorite especially for young  kids. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Sounds fantastic. </p><p>  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.  Thanks  for watching. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great evening, everybody. </p><p>  I won't see you here tomorrow.  I'm off.  But she will. </p><p>  GHARIB:  I'll be here with Bill Griffin.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  We'll see you then.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Thanks so much.  See you tomorrow. </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making this its second setback in a week.

Google's long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without controversy. What the change in shares means for investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Plot twist. Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake. But there may also be hope for the struggling bookseller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, April 3rd.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, it's undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking practices. And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi's plan to raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand.</p><p>Now, the bank's troubles just got worse. The FBI has reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the bank's role in a $400 million fraud involving its Mexican banking unit. Investors have taken notice, sending shares down another 1 percent today.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The FBI is investigating Citigroup's bank in Mexico, Banamex, once considered Citi's crowned jewel. Banamex is now a big problem for Citi. The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil services company in Mexico.</p><p>Even before today's news of a criminal investigation, analysts questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citi failed to pass the federal reserve's most recent stress test.</p><p>DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY: We have a sell on Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door without basically, you know, stopping it.</p><p>So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in place.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The lack of control from the top has some analysts calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p>MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST: John Gerspach, the CFO, was the chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps. Two years ago, Citi was turned down for its capital plan by the Fed. That's strike two. Then, yesterday, being turned down again is strike three.</p><p>Three strikes you're out. I think Citi needs to replace the CFO.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: Also at the center of the controversy, Citi's co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora. Medina Mora has been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at Banamex.</p><p>Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a company is just too big.</p><p>John Reed, former Citi chairman, said at a conference earlier this week that the company was so immense and complex, it's nearly impossible to manage.</p><p>Still, Citi has its defenders on Wall Street.</p><p>ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: I would be buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive. A lot of concern in the marketplace already baked in. We have a couple of catalysts coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think there's still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The question for Citi, how much more bad news investors are willing to take.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Let's turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi. He's managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p>So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation on Citi. You've downgraded it to neutral. Tell us why. And neutral still sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p>TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, I don't know if I'd say there's hope there. But basically as was reported in the story, the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly.</p><p>As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly surrounding the money laundering. I would expect that regulatory action is going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation. But more importantly, you've got a company where their expenses remain very elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that they're little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in the near future.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, you're going to have a protracted legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the sidelines and keep pressure on the stock.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don't mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn't put a sell on that stock and get the heck away from it. Why not? I don't get it.</p><p>HAGERMAN: Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a step back and look at the situation. The earnings have come down on this stock the last three to four consecutive quarters. There's a lot that's already heavily discounted in the shares right now.</p><p>Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed's capital review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and management. But if you look at the valuation today, there's a lot discounted. I don't think there's a lot of downside here in the stock. By the same token, I think, you know, I really can't see much upside from here. I just think it's status quo for a period of time.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, Citi has been under the gun for so long now, and the story we were just reporting it was the point that it's just not enough control at Citibank.</p><p>Is Citi just too big, too complex, too hard to manage?</p><p>HAGERMAN: You know, that's an argument that goes back to John Reed as you reference in your story. This is a very large, complex organization.</p><p>And I would have to agree. No single individual is capable of managing this company. It's been proven time and time again.</p><p>We're starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the last few years. And, you know, it's a very challenging operation when you have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to Latin America. Very difficult.</p><p>And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding your control mechanism within an organization like that.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Lots to talk about here.</p><p>Thank you so much, Todd. Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at Sterne Agee.</p><p>And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine for it. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card protection services they didn't need. The bank will pay the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million.</p><p>MATHISEN: It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall Street today, at least not for the full day.</p><p>Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in all-time record high territory for awhile there. Today's driver growth in the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time jobless claims last week and a jump nation's trade deficit in February prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow's big March market employment report.</p><p>At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a point lower. The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology shares. And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday's record close.</p><p>GHARIB: Now, if you're you were following shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren't seeing double. This was the first day of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock. There was class A and class C. And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares of both classes rose but only by a fraction.</p><p>So, what's behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p>Josh Lipton explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Google's motto is, \"don't be evil\". Another motto could be, \"don't share the power\". In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights.</p><p>Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, class A shares carry voting rights. If you own one share of class A stock, you have one vote. But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10 votes for each share. The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them control over the company's future.</p><p>Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock carries no voting rights. Why do this? Because it means Brin and Page cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make acquisitions without giving up any control of the company.</p><p>TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: It does protect their long-term control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But I think if you look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), they've really had control from day one. They did have the initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction. Investors did incredibly well if you adjust for this move you're basically looking at a $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600.</p><p>LIPTON: What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) investor? Not much. The value of their stock hasn't changed. They just now own two classes of shares instead of one.</p><p>Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the social network's class B stock, which is mostly owned by CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights.</p><p>In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a shopping spree. The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past year.</p><p>(on camera): Google's founders have shown they have the desire for acquisitions both large and small. Now, they have a new way to satisfy that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant.</p><p>Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty ignition switches it made. They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths. Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi's name in their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident. Shares of the auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today. They tumbled nearly 14 percent after one of the bookstore's chains biggest investors --- we're talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the company.</p><p>Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). Liberty Media's decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company, settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut.</p><p>Today's stock plunge has investors concerned about the company's future. But analysts say there's still plenty to be hopeful about.</p><p>JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST: This is definitely a short turn negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). It's taken away a stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position. But that said, they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman of 26 percent who being considering going private. Most importantly, you still have a stock that's very inexpensive.</p><p>BRENNAN: Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble's revenue strength and ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that's driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores.</p><p>TINKER: I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong print sales have been. And ironically, there have been complaints in New York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they like to go to bookstores. It's very different from a lot of the other businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium. There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones still actually wanting to read print books.</p><p>So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from that investment.</p><p>Then, there's the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on. Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: A big development over allegations of rigged markets because of high frequency trading which we've been telling you about all this week. Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology.</p><p>MATHISEN: Strong words about high frequency trading creating an unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab today. In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\" He said traders using that technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO GAP) in profits in the process.</p><p>GHARIB: And here's another hot button issue back in the news, executive compensation. This time, Coca-Cola's in the spotlight on how much it pays its top executives. At a time when the stock price has fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing.</p><p>Sara Eisen has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of its investors over executive pay.</p><p>David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke's 2014 equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the next few years. He says it's overly generous at the expense of shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14 percent to 16 percent.</p><p>DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO: When you look at it realistically, there's an awful lot of money being transferred from the shareholders' pockets to management of the company that's not growing very fast. It's just not right. We think it's wrong.</p><p>EISEN: Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke's stock has sent letters to coke's board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett, who's Coke's top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan.</p><p>But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math simply does not add up.</p><p>GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL: A lot of these awards are very dependent on stock price. Our investors really like that, because management doesn't get paid unless the company performs, and unless our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p>EISEN: CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed. Winters is also questioning Kent's role as chairman f the board, saying it's a conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive compensation. Coke rejects that idea as well.</p><p>BOWDEN: Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is the right structure for our company. And it's important to note that compensation committee sets the compensation for our company. So the compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. So, there's not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p>EISEN (on camera): Executive compensation has always been a hot topic for shareholders. No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett. Shares will get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a vote. Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their heels.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that is where we begin tonight's market focus. The chip maker reported better than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company helped results. Better memory always helps.</p><p>Shares were up initially after hours. The stock ended the regular session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there.</p><p>Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews. The Federal Trade Commission revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review site over the past five years. And according to an article in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to advertise on the site. Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61.</p><p>Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the biggest environmental settlement on record. It will pay more than $5 billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox. This was a supplier of paint materials. The government suit was asking for $25 billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company's Kerr-McGee unit. Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and shares surged 14 percent to $99.</p><p>Perry Ellis' shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a fourth quarter loss. The company says it's disappointed with the results and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls. But earnings did end up topping estimates, and that's what investors focused on. The stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p>And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade. Piper Jaffray lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target to $3 from $8. The firm's site is concerned over the outlook for the company's anti-obesity drug. Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2 percent to $5.83.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the Labor Department's all important march employment report. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only 34,000 layoffs in March. That's a good number unless you're one of the 34,000. That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more people don't consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class. This week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Americans continue to ask the question, where are the jobs? And too many middle class families and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p>PEARSON: Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a hire minimum wage.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES: The economy increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they're working harder but their wages, their incomes aren't going up.</p><p>PEARSON: But five years after the end of the great recession and the loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more people who believe the middle class is disappearing. From the Pew Research Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class. Now, it's just 44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four years.</p><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap. The wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in income over the last 30 years.</p><p>And there's even been a spike in those who identify themselves as lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey. Expert researchers across the country say those social standing trends are accelerating to the down side.</p><p>PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH: Median household income, which is perhaps the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak that it had pre-recession. Indeed, it hasn't returned to its peak in 1999.</p><p>So there's been 15 years of economic stagnation. People live that. They experience that. They also live the growing economic inequality and insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape.</p><p>PEARSON: There is an impact on the main street economy. People who feel they've slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less.</p><p>TAYLER: Today, they're much more sober in their spending habits. And that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera): Another factor in the erosion of the middle class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by 200,000. There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work for six months or longer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and healthy really feel about paying for health insurance. And why it's such a challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Another large group of Americans has found a different way to save money on medical coverage. Young millennials are opting to stay on their parents' insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their own.</p><p>Bertha Coombs explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account executive was a lesson in sticker shock.</p><p>JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE: There's going to be $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p>COOMBS: The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get coverage on his dad's insurance.</p><p>LUNDEEN: He managed to work it out with his company and basically just get me covered without any extra cost to him. So, at that point, the calculation was very easy to make. It was oh, I can pay for health insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn't cost him anything and doesn't cost me anything until I'm 26.</p><p>COOMBS: More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route, according to new data from payroll processor ADP. Since 2010, workers under 30 at the nation's largest companies saw their eligibility for insurance rise over 4 percent. Yet their rate of enrollment in company plans dropped over 7.5 percent. ADP officials say for many, the core issue is cost.</p><p>DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP: Certainly when you look at this population of under 30, they're at the beginning of their careers and their salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations.</p><p>COOMBS: Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their plans to offset the costs of older workers. To engage them they need to focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth policy advocate Jen Mishory.</p><p>JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR: Young people, mental health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people really need and value.</p><p>COOMBS (on camera): We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA. Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans.</p><p>Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p>(voice-over): Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next year, but he'll likely opt for coverage.</p><p>LUNDEEN: I will buy it. But perhaps a little grudgingly.</p><p>COOMBS: Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: To read more about young millennials and how they're dealing with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, a renovation that's nearly 40 years in the making. Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian's really wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30 million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year project, Charles Lindbergh's spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the Atlantic, John Glen's mercury capsule from NASA's first earth orbit and the centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon landing in 1969.</p><p>Now, don't worry if you're planning a trip this summer. The museum will be open during the renovations. It is a favorite especially for young kids.</p><p>GHARIB: Sounds fantastic.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.</p><p>I won't see you here tomorrow. I'm off. But she will.</p><p>GHARIB: I'll be here with Bill Griffin.</p><p>MATHISEN: We'll see you then.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much. See you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making  this its second setback in a week.  And should investors be concerned? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Class divide.   Google's long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without  controversy.  What the change in shares means for investors. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  Plot twist.  Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS)  plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake.  But there may also be hope for  the struggling bookseller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Thursday, April 3rd. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Thanks for joining  us. </p><p>Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was  bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis.  Since then, it's  undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about  dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money  laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking  practices.  And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi's plan to  raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on  concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand. </p><p>Now, the bank's troubles just got worse.  The FBI has reportedly  launched a criminal investigation into the bank's role in a $400 million  fraud involving its Mexican banking unit.  Investors have taken notice,  sending shares down another 1 percent today. </p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about  Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The FBI is investigating Citigroup's bank in Mexico, Banamex, once  considered Citi's crowned jewel.  Banamex is now a big problem for Citi.   The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil  services company in Mexico. </p><p>Even before today's news of a criminal investigation, analysts  questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citi failed to pass the  federal reserve's most recent stress test.</p><p>DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY:  We have a sell on  Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty  tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a  result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door  without basically, you know, stopping it. </p><p>So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come  down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in  place.</p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA:  The lack of control from the top has some analysts  calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p>MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST:  John Gerspach, the CFO, was the  chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup  (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps.  Two years ago, Citi was turned down for  its capital plan by the Fed.  That's strike two.  Then, yesterday, being  turned down again is strike three. </p><p>Three strikes you're out.  I think Citi needs to replace the CFO. </p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA:  Also at the center of the controversy, Citi's co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora.  Medina Mora has  been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most  recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at  Banamex.</p><p>Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a  company is just too big.</p><p>John Reed, former Citi chairman, said at a conference earlier this  week that the company was so immense and complex, it's nearly impossible to  manage. </p><p>Still, Citi has its defenders on Wall Street. </p><p>ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  I would be  buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive.  A lot of  concern in the marketplace already baked in.  We have a couple of catalysts  coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think  there's still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track. </p><p>CARUSO-CABRERA:  The question for Citi, how much more bad news  investors are willing to take.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Let's turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi.   He's managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p>So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation  on Citi.  You've downgraded it to neutral.  Tell us why.  And neutral still  sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p>TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Well, I don't know if  I'd say there's hope there.  But basically as was reported in the story,  the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really  underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly. </p><p>As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly  surrounding the money laundering.  I would expect that regulatory action is  going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation.  But more  importantly, you've got a company where their expenses remain very  elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that  they're little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of  settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors  questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in  the near future.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, you're going to have a protracted  legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the  sidelines and keep pressure on the stock. </p><p>MATHISEN:  I don't mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to  me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn't put a sell on that stock  and get the heck away from it.  Why not?  I don't get it.</p><p>HAGERMAN:  Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a  step back and look at the situation.  The earnings have come down on this  stock the last three to four consecutive quarters.  There's a lot that's  already heavily discounted in the shares right now. </p><p>Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed's capital  review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and  management.  But if you look at the valuation today, there's a lot  discounted.  I don't think there's a lot of downside here in the stock.  By  the same token, I think, you know, I really can't see much upside from  here.  I just think it's status quo for a period of time. </p><p>GHARIB:  You know, Citi has been under the gun for so long now, and  the story we were just reporting it was the point that it's just not enough  control at Citibank. </p><p>Is Citi just too big, too complex, too hard to manage? </p><p>HAGERMAN:  You know, that's an argument that goes back to John Reed as  you reference in your story.  This is a very large, complex organization. </p><p>And I would have to agree.  No single individual is capable of  managing this company.  It's been proven time and time again. </p><p>We're starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the  last few years.  And, you know, it's a very challenging operation when you  have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to  Latin America.  Very difficult. </p><p>And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding  your control mechanism within an organization like that. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Lots to talk about here. </p><p>Thank you so much, Todd.  Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at  Sterne Agee.</p><p>And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine  for it.  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle  allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card  protection services they didn't need.  The bank will pay the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million. </p><p>MATHISEN:  It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall  Street today, at least not for the full day. </p><p>Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in  all-time record high territory for awhile there.  Today's driver growth in  the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time  jobless claims last week and a jump nation's trade deficit in February  prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow's big March market employment report. </p><p>At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a  point lower.  The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology  shares.  And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday's record close. </p><p>GHARIB:  Now, if you're you were following shares of Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren't seeing double.  This was the first day  of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock.  There  was class A and class C.  And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares  of both classes rose but only by a fraction. </p><p>So, what's behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p>Josh Lipton explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Google's motto is, \"don't be evil\".  Another motto could be, \"don't share  the power\".  In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the  direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights. </p><p>Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  stock, class A shares carry voting rights.  If you own one share of class A  stock, you have one vote.  But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page  maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10  votes for each share.  The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive  chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them  control over the company's future. </p><p>Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock  carries no voting rights.  Why do this?  Because it means Brin and Page  cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make  acquisitions without giving up any control of the company. </p><p>TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP:  It does protect their long-term  control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  But I think if you look at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), they've really had control from day one.  They did have the  initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction.  Investors did  incredibly well if you adjust for this move you're basically looking at a  $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600. </p><p>LIPTON:  What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  investor?  Not much.  The value of their stock hasn't changed.  They just  now own two classes of shares instead of one. </p><p>Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock  include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), the social network's class B stock, which is mostly owned by  CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights. </p><p>In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a  shopping spree.  The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for  $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past  year.</p><p>(on camera):  Google's founders have shown they have the desire for  acquisitions both large and small.  Now, they have a new way to satisfy  that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant. </p><p>Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that  massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty  ignition switches it made.  They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths.  Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi's name in  their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee  whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident.  Shares of the  auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares  of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today.  They tumbled nearly 14  percent after one of the bookstore's chains biggest investors --- we're  talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the  company. </p><p>Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble  (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS).   Liberty Media's decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three  years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company,  settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut. </p><p>Today's stock plunge has investors concerned about the company's  future.  But analysts say there's still plenty to be hopeful about. </p><p>JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST:  This is definitely a short turn  negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS).  It's taken away a  stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position.  But that said,  they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman  of 26 percent who being considering going private.  Most importantly, you  still have a stock that's very inexpensive. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble's revenue strength and  ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that's  driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores. </p><p>TINKER:  I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong  print sales have been.  And ironically, there have been complaints in New  York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they  like to go to bookstores.  It's very different from a lot of the other  businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium.   There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones  still actually wanting to read print books. </p><p>So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera):  Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts  many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the  financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from  that investment. </p><p>Then, there's the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on.  Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been  losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the  battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  A big development over allegations of rigged markets because  of high frequency trading which we've been telling you about all this week.   Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now  giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades  using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX  trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Strong words about high frequency trading creating an  unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab  today.  In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a  growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\"  He said traders using that  technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO  GAP) in profits in the process. </p><p>GHARIB:  And here's another hot button issue back in the news,  executive compensation.  This time, Coca-Cola's in the spotlight on how  much it pays its top executives.  At a time when the stock price has  fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing. </p><p>Sara Eisen has the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of  its investors over executive pay.</p><p>David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke's 2014  equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the  next few years.  He says it's overly generous at the expense of  shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14  percent to 16 percent. </p><p>DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO:  When you look at it  realistically, there's an awful lot of money being transferred from the  shareholders' pockets to management of the company that's not growing very  fast.  It's just not right.  We think it's wrong.</p><p>EISEN:  Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke's stock has sent  letters to coke's board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett,  who's Coke's top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan. </p><p>But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math  simply does not add up.  </p><p>GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL:  A lot of these  awards are very dependent on stock price.  Our investors really like that,  because management doesn't get paid unless the company performs, and unless  our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p>EISEN:  CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more  than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed.  Winters is  also questioning Kent's role as chairman f the board, saying it's a  conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive  compensation.  Coke rejects that idea as well. </p><p>BOWDEN:  Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is  the right structure for our company.  And it's important to note that  compensation committee sets the compensation for our company.  So the  compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors.  So,  there's not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p>EISEN (on camera):  Executive compensation has always been a hot topic  for shareholders.  No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett.  Shares will  get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a  vote.  Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their  heels. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that  is where we begin tonight's market focus.  The chip maker reported better  than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger  recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company  helped results.  Better memory always helps. </p><p>Shares were up initially after hours.  The stock ended the regular  session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there. </p><p>Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews.  The Federal Trade Commission  revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review  site over the past five years.  And according to an article in the \"Wall  Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that  claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to  advertise on the site.  Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61. </p><p>Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the  biggest environmental settlement on record.  It will pay more than $5  billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox.  This  was a supplier of paint materials.  The government suit was asking for $25  billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company's  Kerr-McGee unit.  Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and  shares surged 14 percent to $99. </p><p>Perry Ellis' shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a  fourth quarter loss.  The company says it's disappointed with the results  and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls.  But earnings  did end up topping estimates, and that's what investors focused on.  The  stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p>And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade.  Piper Jaffray  lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target  to $3 from $8.  The firm's site is concerned over the outlook for the  company's anti-obesity drug.  Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2  percent to $5.83.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the  Labor Department's all important march employment report.  The outplacement  firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only  34,000 layoffs in March.  That's a good number unless you're one of the  34,000.  That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first  quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low. </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major  stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more  people don't consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the  American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach. </p><p>Hampton Pearson has more. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class.  This  week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Americans continue to  ask the question, where are the jobs?  And too many middle class families  and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p>PEARSON:  Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a  hire minimum wage.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES:  The economy  increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class  families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they're  working harder but their wages, their incomes aren't going up. </p><p>PEARSON:  But five years after the end of the great recession and the  loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more  people who believe the middle class is disappearing.  From the Pew Research  Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class.  Now, it's just  44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four  years. </p><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap.  The  wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in  income over the last 30 years. </p><p>And there's even been a spike in those who identify themselves as  lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey.  Expert  researchers across the country say those social standing trends are  accelerating to the down side. </p><p>PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH:  Median household income, which is perhaps  the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak  that it had pre-recession.  Indeed, it hasn't returned to its peak in 1999.  </p><p>So there's been 15 years of economic stagnation.  People live that.   They experience that.  They also live the growing economic inequality and  insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape. </p><p>PEARSON:  There is an impact on the main street economy.  People who  feel they've slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less. </p><p>TAYLER:  Today, they're much more sober in their spending habits.  And  that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of  which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera):  Another factor in the erosion of the middle  class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by  200,000.  There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work  for six months or longer. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and  healthy really feel about paying for health insurance.  And why it's such a  challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  Another large group of Americans has found a different way to  save money on medical coverage.  Young millennials are opting to stay on  their parents' insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their  own. </p><p>Bertha Coombs explains. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account  executive was a lesson in sticker shock. </p><p>JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE:  There's going to be  $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p>COOMBS:  The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his  employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get  coverage on his dad's insurance. </p><p>LUNDEEN:  He managed to work it out with his company and basically  just get me covered without any extra cost to him.  So, at that point, the  calculation was very easy to make.  It was oh, I can pay for health  insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn't cost  him anything and doesn't cost me anything until I'm 26. </p><p>COOMBS:  More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route,  according to new data from payroll processor ADP.  Since 2010, workers  under 30 at the nation's largest companies saw their eligibility for  insurance rise over 4 percent.  Yet their rate of enrollment in company  plans dropped over 7.5 percent.  ADP officials say for many, the core issue  is cost. </p><p>DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP:  Certainly when you look at this  population of under 30, they're at the beginning of their careers and their  salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations. </p><p>COOMBS:  Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their  plans to offset the costs of older workers.  To engage them they need to  focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth  policy advocate Jen Mishory. </p><p>JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR:  Young people, mental  health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people  really need and value.  </p><p>COOMBS (on camera):  We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA.   Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans. </p><p>Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p>(voice-over):  Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next  year, but he'll likely opt for coverage. </p><p>LUNDEEN:  I will buy it.  But perhaps a little grudgingly. </p><p>COOMBS:  Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  To read more about young millennials and how they're dealing  with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, a renovation that's nearly 40 years in  the making.  Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and  space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian's really  wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30  million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA). </p><p>Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year  project, Charles Lindbergh's spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the  Atlantic, John Glen's mercury capsule from NASA's first earth orbit and the  centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon  landing in 1969. </p><p>Now, don't worry if you're planning a trip this summer.  The museum  will be open during the renovations.  It is a favorite especially for young  kids. </p><p>GHARIB:  Sounds fantastic. </p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.  Thanks  for watching. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great evening, everybody. </p><p>I won't see you here tomorrow.  I'm off.  But she will. </p><p>GHARIB:  I'll be here with Bill Griffin.</p><p>MATHISEN:  We'll see you then.</p><p>GHARIB:  Thanks so much.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) is reportedly the subject of a federal probe, making this its second setback in a week. And should investors be concerned?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Class divide. Google's long-awaited stock split has arrived and it is not without controversy. What the change in shares means for investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Plot twist. Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) plunge as Liberty Media flashes its stake. But there may also be hope for the struggling bookseller.</p><p/><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, April 3rd.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Thanks for joining us.</p><p/><p>Citigroup (NYSE:C) has struggled more than other banks since it was bailed out by Uncle Sam during the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, it's undergoing a handful of management shakeups, battled questions about dubious foreclosure practices, fended off allegations of lax money laundering protections and faced a number of probes into its banking practices. And just last week, the federal reserve rejected Citi's plan to raise its shareholder dividend and jack up its stock buyback complain on concerns about how much capital the bank has on hand.</p><p/><p>Now, the bank's troubles just got worse. The FBI has reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the bank's role in a $400 million fraud involving its Mexican banking unit. Investors have taken notice, sending shares down another 1 percent today.</p><p/><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more now on the latest news about Citigroup (NYSE:C) and how much more the banking behemoth can take.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The FBI is investigating Citigroup's bank in Mexico, Banamex, once considered Citi's crowned jewel. Banamex is now a big problem for Citi. The company revealed in late February a $400 million fraud involving an oil services company in Mexico.</p><p/><p>Even before today's news of a criminal investigation, analysts questioned whether Mexico was one of the reasons Citifailed to pass the federal reserve's most recent stress test.</p><p/><p>DICK BOVE, RAFFERTY CAPITAL VICE PRES. OF EQUITY: We have a sell on Citigroup (NYSE:C) because we do think that the company is facing a pretty tough time with all of this international upset, and particularly as a result of what went on in Mexico where they let $400 million out the door without basically, you know, stopping it.</p><p/><p>So, I think that it made a heck of a lot sense for the feds to come down on Citigroup (NYSE:C), because clearly their controls are not in place.</p><p/><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The lack of control from the top has some analysts calling for a broader shakeup at Citi.</p><p/><p>MIKE MAYO, CLSA RESEARCH ANALYST: John Gerspach, the CFO, was the chief accounting officer going into the financial crisis when Citigroup (NYSE:C) had accounting mishaps. Two years ago, Citiwas turned down for its capital plan by the Fed. That's strike two. Then, yesterday, being turned down again is strike three.</p><p/><p>Three strikes you're out. I think Citineeds to replace the CFO.</p><p/><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: Also at the center of the controversy, Citi's co- president of global consumer banking, Manuel Medina Mora. Medina Mora has been in charge of Banamex since 1996 and already deducts (ph) his most recent bonus by more than $1 million, for lack of sufficient controls at Banamex.</p><p/><p>Some say the issues the company faces in Mexico are a sign that a company is just too big.</p><p/><p>John Reed, former Citichairman, said at a conference earlier this week that the company was so immense and complex, it's nearly impossible to manage.</p><p/><p>Still, Citihas its defenders on Wall Street.</p><p/><p>ANDREW MARQUARDT, EVERCORE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: I would be buying Citigroup (NYSE:C) at these levels, extremely attractive. A lot of concern in the marketplace already baked in. We have a couple of catalysts coming up in terms of earnings that I think will be mixed but I think there's still a catalyst that they can resubmit and get on track.</p><p/><p>CARUSO-CABRERA: The question for Citi, how much more bad news investors are willing to take.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Let's turn now to Todd Hagerman for more analysis on Citi. He's managing director at Sterne Agee.</p><p/><p>So, Todd, I understand that until today, you had a buy recommendation on Citi. You've downgraded it to neutral. Tell us why. And neutral still sounds like you have some hope there.</p><p/><p>TODD HAGERMAN, STERNE AGEE MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, I don't know if I'd say there's hope there. But basically as was reported in the story, the regulatory risk, the legal risk, I think people are really underestimating those factors going into the story into 2014 quite frankly.</p><p/><p>As you mentioned, we now have criminal investigation, certainly surrounding the money laundering. I would expect that regulatory action is going to soon follow surrounding the Banamex situation. But more importantly, you've got a company where their expenses remain very elevated, notably tied to legal, and, you know, I should point out that they're little bit behind the curve relative to their peers in terms of settling some of these big lawsuits, which leaves some investors questioning whether, you know, book value might be subject to impairment in the near future.</p><p/><p>So, I think at the end of the day, you're going to have a protracted legal and regulatory scenario which is going to keep people on the sidelines and keep pressure on the stock.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: I don't mean to be impolite, Todd, but with all you said to me, I am absolutely dumbfounded why you wouldn't put a sell on that stock and get the heck away from it. Why not? I don't get it.</p><p/><p>HAGERMAN: Look, yes, well, I mean, you have -- you have to take a step back and look at the situation. The earnings have come down on this stock the last three to four consecutive quarters. There's a lot that's already heavily discounted in the shares right now.</p><p/><p>Certainly, there was a lot of optimistic going into the Fed's capital review program, last week, obviously a big blow to both shareholders and management. But if you look at the valuation today, there's a lot discounted. I don't think there's a lot of downside here in the stock. By the same token, I think, you know, I really can't see much upside from here. I just think it's status quo for a period of time.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: You know, Citihas been under the gun for so long now, and the story we were just reporting it was the point that it's just not enough control at Citibank.</p><p/><p>Is Citijust too big, too complex, too hard to manage?</p><p/><p>HAGERMAN: You know, that's an argument that goes back to John Reed as you reference in your story. This is a very large, complex organization.</p><p/><p>And I would have to agree. No single individual is capable of managing this company. It's been proven time and time again.</p><p/><p>We're starting to see a revolving door within the CEO office over the last few years. And, you know, it's a very challenging operation when you have a global network that stretches from Asia to here in North America to Latin America. Very difficult.</p><p/><p>And in particular, the Fed is going to have a hard time understanding your control mechanism within an organization like that.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: All right. Lots to talk about here.</p><p/><p>Thank you so much, Todd. Todd Hagerman, financial services analyst at Sterne Agee.</p><p/><p>And another big bank behaving badly and looking to pay a hefty fine for it. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is close to an agreement to settle allegations that it forced customers to sign up for extra credit card protection services they didn't need. The bank will pay the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more than $800 million.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: It was close, but there were no records broken on Wall Street today, at least not for the full day.</p><p/><p>Stocks began the day sprinting higher with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in all-time record high territory for awhile there. Today's driver growth in the services sector of the economy last month, but a spike in first-time jobless claims last week and a jump nation's trade deficit in February prompted a fullback ahead of tomorrow's big March market employment report.</p><p/><p>At the end of an up and down day, the Dow ended just a fraction of a point lower. The NASDAQ was down 38 on a selloff in biotech and technology shares. And the S&amp;P was off 2 points from Wednesday's record close.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Now, if you're you were following shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) today, no, you weren't seeing double. This was the first day of trading for two separate classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock. There was class A and class C. And unlike a lot of big tech names today, shares of both classes rose but only by a fraction.</p><p/><p>So, what's behind the two different classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock and who are the big winners in the split.</p><p/><p>Josh Lipton explains.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Google's motto is, \"don't be evil\". Another motto could be, \"don't share the power\". In Silicon Valley, power can mean having a say over the direction of the company by being a shareholder with voting rights.</p><p/><p>Before today, there were only two classes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, class A shares carry voting rights. If you own one share of class A stock, you have one vote. But cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page maintain control of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) using class B shares that carry 10 votes for each share. The two, along with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, control more than 60 percent of the vote, which gives them control over the company's future.</p><p/><p>Starting today, investors can buy class C shares, but that stock carries no voting rights. Why do this? Because it means Brin and Page cannot use this new class of stock to compensate employees or to make acquisitions without giving up any control of the company.</p><p/><p>TOM FORTE, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: It does protect their long-term control in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But I think if you look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), they've really had control from day one. They did have the initial one vote per and 10 votes per distinction. Investors did incredibly well if you adjust for this move you're basically looking at a $42.50 IPO price and now, the stock trading in the neighborhood of $600.</p><p/><p>LIPTON: What does this mean for the average Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) investor? Not much. The value of their stock hasn't changed. They just now own two classes of shares instead of one.</p><p/><p>Other companies the S&amp;P 500 that also have different classes of stock include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the social network's class B stock, which is mostly owned by CEO Mark Zuckerberg retain the majority of voting rights.</p><p/><p>In just the past few months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a shopping spree. The company acquired smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion and Boston Dynamics which makes robots.</p><p/><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought more than 20 companies over the past year.</p><p/><p>(on camera): Google's founders have shown they have the desire for acquisitions both large and small. Now, they have a new way to satisfy that appetite while maintaining their control of the search giant.</p><p/><p>Josh Lipton, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Silicon Valley.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: The auto parts maker Delphi is getting drag into that massive legal trouble at General Motors (NYSE:GM) over those faulty ignition switches it made. They have been linked to at least 13 crash- related deaths. Plaintiffs suing G.M. have now added Delphi's name in their lawsuits against the automaker, included a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 Chevy Cobalt accident. Shares of the auto parts giant down about a half percent today at $69.73.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Well, that drop was nothing compared to the decline in shares of Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) today. They tumbled nearly 14 percent after one of the bookstore's chains biggest investors --- we're talking about Liberty Media -- said it sold almost all its stock in the company.</p><p/><p>Morgan Brennan reports on the latest chapter in the Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) story.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A blow for struggling bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). Liberty Media's decision to sell its stake is a big turn around from three years ago when the media giant had tried to buy the entire company, settling instead for a 17 percent ownership cut.</p><p/><p>Today's stock plunge has investors concerned about the company's future. But analysts say there's still plenty to be hopeful about.</p><p/><p>JOHN TINKER, MAXIM GROUP ANALYST: This is definitely a short turn negative for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS). It's taken away a stabilizing force in a somewhat controversial position. But that said, they still have everything to play for in that you still have Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a large investor in the nook, you still have the chairman of 26 percent who being considering going private. Most importantly, you still have a stock that's very inexpensive.</p><p/><p>BRENNAN: Analysts believe that Barnes &amp; Noble's revenue strength and ultimately its survival of the company depends on the very thing that's driven so many competitors like Borders out of business, its retail stores.</p><p/><p>TINKER: I think the surprise in the space has been just how strong print sales have been. And ironically, there have been complaints in New York recently about the number of stores closing as people realizing they like to go to bookstores. It's very different from a lot of the other businesses that went digital and just completely left behind the medium. There are even stories now of children who watch movies on their iPhones still actually wanting to read print books.</p><p/><p>So, that really is -- that asset continues for a long, long time.</p><p/><p>BRENNAN (on camera): Still Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) fasts many hurdles as Liberty sells out of its stake, the move erodes some of the financial stability Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS) has gained from that investment.</p><p/><p>Then, there's the Nook, the e-reader partners with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on. Once a bright spot for the company, the device has been losing money, with sale down 50 percent last quarter.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Los Angeles.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, Coke fires back at an activist investor as the battle over executive compensation at the firm bubbles up.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: A big development over allegations of rigged markets because of high frequency trading which we've been telling you about all this week. Interactive brokers, this is the online stock trading service, is now giving customers the option of specifying whether they want to make trades using high frequency technology or have their orders go only through an IEX trading platform that avoids so-called HFT technology.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Strong words about high frequency trading creating an unlevel playing field for individual investors coming from Charles Schwab today. In a statement, Schwab said high frequency trading is, quote, \"a growing cancer that needs to be addressed.\" He said traders using that technology are again quoting here, gaming the system and reaping (AUDIO GAP) in profits in the process.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And here's another hot button issue back in the news, executive compensation. This time, Coca-Cola's in the spotlight on how much it pays its top executives. At a time when the stock price has fizzled, soda sales are down and consumer tastes are changing.</p><p/><p>Sara Eisen has the story.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) finding itself in a very unusual public fight with one of its investors over executive pay.</p><p/><p>David Winters, a long-time value investor, is criticizing Coke's 2014 equity plan which outlines stocks and options awarded to employees over the next few years. He says it's overly generous at the expense of shareholders because it dilutes the value of their shares by as much as 14 percent to 16 percent.</p><p/><p>DAVID WINTERS, WINTERGREEN ADVISERS CEO: When you look at it realistically, there's an awful lot of money being transferred from the shareholders' pockets to management of the company that's not growing very fast. It's just not right. We think it's wrong.</p><p/><p>EISEN: Winters who owns 2.5 million shares of Coke's stock has sent letters to coke's board and to fellow investors including Warren Buffett, who's Coke's top shareholder, urging them to vote against the plan.</p><p/><p>But Coke is fighting back, saying Winters is misinformed and his math simply does not add up.</p><p/><p>GLORIA BOWDEN, COCA-COLA ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL: A lot of these awards are very dependent on stock price. Our investors really like that, because management doesn't get paid unless the company performs, and unless our investors get an additional return on theirs.</p><p/><p>EISEN: CEO Mukhtar Kent actually saw his total compensation drop more than 30 percent last year because the stock underperformed. Winters is also questioning Kent's role as chairman f the board, saying it's a conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions about executive compensation. Coke rejects that idea as well.</p><p/><p>BOWDEN: Our board strongly believes that a combined chair and CEO is the right structure for our company. And it's important to note that compensation committee sets the compensation for our company. So the compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. So, there's not a conflict of interest for having a combined chair-CEO role.</p><p/><p>EISEN (on camera): Executive compensation has always been a hot topic for shareholders. No word yet on Coke from Warren Buffett. Shares will get their say on April 23rd at the annual meeting when the plan is up for a vote. Until then, Mr. Winters and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are digging in their heels.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) swings to a profit, and that is where we begin tonight's market focus. The chip maker reported better than expected results and sharply higher revenue, helped by a stronger recovery from chip prices, also its recent acquisition of a memory company helped results. Better memory always helps.</p><p/><p>Shares were up initially after hours. The stock ended the regular session down nearly 1.5 percent, $24 even the close there.</p><p/><p>Battle is brewing over Yelp reviews. The Federal Trade Commission revealed that it has received more than 2,000 complaints about the review site over the past five years. And according to an article in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" most of those complaints are from small businesses that claim to have received unfair reviews, often after turning down a pitch to advertise on the site. Shares plunged 6 percent to $70.61.</p><p/><p>Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) shares jumped after announcing the biggest environmental settlement on record. It will pay more than $5 billion to settle claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of Tronox. This was a supplier of paint materials. The government suit was asking for $25 billion to clean up 85 years of pollution left behind by the company's Kerr-McGee unit. Investors were relieved the case is finally closed and shares surged 14 percent to $99.</p><p/><p>Perry Ellis' shares popped even though the clothing maker reported a fourth quarter loss. The company says it's disappointed with the results and blamed it on bad weather and slow traffic in the malls. But earnings did end up topping estimates, and that's what investors focused on. The stock rose more than 2.5 percent to $14.62.</p><p/><p>And Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) shares tumbled on a downgrade. Piper Jaffray lowered its rating on the stock to underweight and slashed its price target to $3 from $8. The firm's site is concerned over the outlook for the company's anti-obesity drug. Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) fell more than 5 1/2 percent to $5.83.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Well, some good news about jobs just one day ahead of the Labor Department's all important march employment report. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas says that U.S. companies planned only 34,000 layoffs in March. That's a good number unless you're one of the 34,000. That added to the number of announced job cuts in the first quarter and made it come in at a 19-year low.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Well, despite a string of strong economic data and the major stock indexes near record highs, a recent study suggests more and more people don't consider themselves middle class and feel their version of the American Dream is moving increasingly out of reach.</p><p/><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Washington never stops talking about restoring the middle class. This week, house Republicans pitching their latest budget plan.</p><p/><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Americans continue to ask the question, where are the jobs? And too many middle class families and small businesses continue to struggle in this economy.</p><p/><p>PEARSON: Ditto President Obama on the road in Michigan pushing for a hire minimum wage.</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES: The economy increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class families, people who are struggling to get in the middle class, they're working harder but their wages, their incomes aren't going up.</p><p/><p>PEARSON: But five years after the end of the great recession and the loss of nearly 9 million jobs, several new surveys find more and more people who believe the middle class is disappearing. From the Pew Research Center in 2008, 53 percent called themselves middle class. Now, it's just 44 percent according to a January survey, a 20 percent drop in just four years.</p><p/><p>Census Bureau data shows a dramatic increase in the wealth gap. The wealthiest 5 percent of American households seeing a huge increase in income over the last 30 years.</p><p/><p>And there's even been a spike in those who identify themselves as lower class, according to a University of Chicago survey. Expert researchers across the country say those social standing trends are accelerating to the down side.</p><p/><p>PAUL TAYLER, PEW RESEARCH: Median household income, which is perhaps the best single metric of economic well-being, has not returned to the peak that it had pre-recession. Indeed, it hasn't returned to its peak in 1999.</p><p/><p>So there's been 15 years of economic stagnation. People live that. They experience that. They also live the growing economic inequality and insecurity that has been a part of the modern economic landscape.</p><p/><p>PEARSON: There is an impact on the main street economy. People who feel they've slipped from the middle class tend to spend and borrow less.</p><p/><p>TAYLER: Today, they're much more sober in their spending habits. And that may indeed have a knock on effect in an economy about 70 percent of which is fuelled by consumer spending.</p><p/><p>PEARSON (on camera): Another factor in the erosion of the middle class, long-term unemployment, which actually went up in February by 200,000. There are now nearly 4 million people who have been out of work for six months or longer.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, how the young and healthy really feel about paying for health insurance. And why it's such a challenge to get them to sign up.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Another large group of Americans has found a different way to save money on medical coverage. Young millennials are opting to stay on their parents' insurance plans instead of signing up and paying for their own.</p><p/><p>Bertha Coombs explains.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For Jay Lundeen, navigating health benefits when he got a job as an account executive was a lesson in sticker shock.</p><p/><p>JAY LUNDEEN, CASON NIGHTINGALE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE: There's going to be $100, $150 for me every month.</p><p/><p>COOMBS: The 25-year-old opted against taking benefits from his employer Casey Nightingale because under the ACA, he was able to get coverage on his dad's insurance.</p><p/><p>LUNDEEN: He managed to work it out with his company and basically just get me covered without any extra cost to him. So, at that point, the calculation was very easy to make. It was oh, I can pay for health insurance through my company or I can stay with my dad and it doesn't cost him anything and doesn't cost me anything until I'm 26.</p><p/><p>COOMBS: More young workers like him are taking the mom and dad route, according to new data from payroll processor ADP. Since 2010, workers under 30 at the nation's largest companies saw their eligibility for insurance rise over 4 percent. Yet their rate of enrollment in company plans dropped over 7.5 percent. ADP officials say for many, the core issue is cost.</p><p/><p>DAVID MARINI, ADP DIVISION VP: Certainly when you look at this population of under 30, they're at the beginning of their careers and their salaries would tend to be lower than other age group populations.</p><p/><p>COOMBS: Big firms need healthy young employees to sign up for their plans to offset the costs of older workers. To engage them they need to focus on affordable options and on benefits that matter to them, says youth policy advocate Jen Mishory.</p><p/><p>JEN MISHORY, YOUNG INVICIBLES DEPUTY DIRECTOR: Young people, mental health services, preventative care, the kind of services young people really need and value.</p><p/><p>COOMBS (on camera): We could see a shift in 2016 under ACA. Employers will be able to enroll workers automatically in benefit plans.</p><p/><p>Also in 2016, steeper fines kick in under the individual mandate.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): Jay Lundeen has thought about just paying a fine next year, but he'll likely opt for coverage.</p><p/><p>LUNDEEN: I will buy it. But perhaps a little grudgingly.</p><p/><p>COOMBS: Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: To read more about young millennials and how they're dealing with their health care issues go to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, a renovation that's nearly 40 years in the making. Some of the most iconic artifacts of American aviation and space history will be getting updated displays at the Smithsonian's really wonderful national air and space museum in Washington, thanks to a $30 million donation from Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p/><p>Among the pieces getting brand-new displays after the two-year project, Charles Lindbergh's spirit of St. Louis propeller plane across the Atlantic, John Glen's mercury capsule from NASA's first earth orbit and the centerpiece of the museum, the Apollo lunar module from the very first moon landing in 1969.</p><p/><p>Now, don't worry if you're planning a trip this summer. The museum will be open during the renovations. It is a favorite especially for young kids.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Sounds fantastic.</p><p/><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.</p><p/><p>I won't see you here tomorrow. I'm off. But she will.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: I'll be here with Bill Griffin.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: We'll see you then.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much.

The S&amp;P ends its string of gains thanks to fresh trade tensions and the possibility that they may never fully go away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Border bottleneck.  The auto industry faces a new challenge and it`s coming from the dividing line between the U.S. and Mexico.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And rising rents.  Why it`s not just home prices that are sky high in some markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, April 9th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Bill is off this evening.</p><p>There was a sense of nervousness on Wall Street today not only because earnings season is about to start, but also because of trade.  That caused the S&amp;P 500 to halt an eight-day rally and push the treasury yields lower.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190 points to 26,150.  The Nasdaq dropped 44 and the S&amp;P 500 gave back 17.</p><p>And today`s trade issue wasn`t about China.  Instead, it was about the European Union.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It`s the latest salvo in the U.S.-Europe trade dispute, which had gone mostly quiet since the truce last August.  But it`s ramping up again.  The U.S. trade representative outlining $11 billion in European goods subject to new tariffs including aircraft, wine and 40 different types of cheese.</p><p>It`s retaliation for Europe`s subsidies on Boeing (NYSE:BA) competitor Airbus.  President Trump tweeting that the E.U. has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years, it will soon stop.  It`s not clear how high the tariffs would be or when they would go into effect.  But three White House aides tell me the goal on trade policy is to pivot the negotiations with Europe which have stalled once China trade talks have concluded.</p><p>The Trump administration has a May 18th deadline to chart its next steps on auto tariffs which will largely impact Europe.  Hence, why President Trump suggested a four-week time frame for China talks, said they would end before that date.  China said it`s not committed to that timeline and Brussels called the new terror threat exaggerated.  But President Trump has shown he`s not one to back down.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Much of the focus investors have been on trade relations with China and a hope for a deal between the world`s two largest economies.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that might not signal the end of the trade story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market commentary sees tariffs in the trade war as temporary events.  A U.S.-China trade deal, the thinking goes, will sound the all-clear signal for markets and the economy, but their indications may be in for a longer, more protracted trade battle, a forever trade war that could last the balance of the Trump administration.</p><p>The chief economist of the IMF which downgraded global and U.S. growth today cited specific concerns for ongoing trade battles.</p><p>GITA GOPINATH, IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST:  There has been improvement on the front between the U.S. and China, and a possible agreement in the near future.  You know, we are worried about trade tensions escalating in other sectors like the auto sector, and that is particularly damaging given that it`s a highly integrated sector for the large global supply chains.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Consider these developments.  The tariffs remain in place for Mexico and Canada even after the U.S. struck a trade deal with the two countries.  The U.S. wants to retain the right to put tariffs on China even after they signed a trade deal.</p><p>Finally, in just the past couple of days, the U.S. threatened the European Union with tariffs on aircrafts and autos could be next.</p><p>Art Hogan, chief market strategist with National Security, says if the administration decides to pivot immediately to tariffs on European autos, any positive momentum derived from an end to U.S.-China trade war will dissipate rapidly.  It could be that tariffs are a negotiating tool and another explanation could be that the administration could keep tariffs in place for years in order to protect U.S. industries have permanently reduced imports.  If the goal is bringing back manufacturing loss to China and other chief competitors, then temporary tariffs won`t do.  If that`s the goal, markets should prepare for permanent trade barriers and possibly a forever trade war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The number of job openings fell to an 11-month low in February.  According to the Labor Department, the measure dropped by 538,000 to 7.1 million.  That`s the lowest level since March of last year.  But the decline is off of near record levels and if you recall the government employment report that month showed a sharp dip, but only to bounce back in March.</p><p>Oil prices fell today, but that has not been the trend.  Domestic crude is up about 40 percent this year.  There have been recent rumblings about violence in Libya that have been impacted by sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.</p><p>So we brought in John Kilduff.  He joins us now to talk more about what`s happening in the oil market and what it means to you.  He is founding partner at Again Capital.</p><p>Welcome back, John.</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL:  Good evening, Sue.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s start with Libya and the possible impact that it is having on oil prices right now.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right, it`s sort of the icing on a bad cake for consumers at this point.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Basically, we`ve had warring factions in Libya for a year since Moammar Gadhafi, the former dictator, was overthrown and ultimately killed.  There is a consolidation now of power going on.  There is a general by the name of Haftar that has marshaled his resources.  He already controls the eastern part of Libya and the oil is falling there.  He is now making a move to consolidate the rest of the country and the battle for Tripoli, the capital is on so to speak.</p><p>I`m getting the sense that he`ll prevail and that the situation will revert to the way it was when Moammar Gadhafi was there, a sort of heavy handed force on an otherwise tribally organized country.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Which is good news for consumers because the oil will flow.</p><p>HERERA:  The oil will flow.  It is not flowing for other parts of the country, of the world, rather and the whole situation is really exacerbated by the fact that we`ve had some refining issues here at home, correct?  I mean, we`ve had bad weather in certain places and catastrophes in others.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right, and sort of the one-two punch is this.  You have Venezuela imploding because of what`s happening in that country and its involvement into just zero oil production at some point here.  Also, too, you have a very committed Saudi Arabia that`s working hard to reduce global supplies and they`ve undercut their quota by quite a bit.  So, that has tightened the market.</p><p>So, now, you add Venezuela getting worse and worse and you add the Iran sanctions and now you add problems with the U.S. refiners and it sort of gets the cauldron boiled up from time to time.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, we`ve had major fires at U.S. refineries and we`ve had the Mideast flooding.  All of this for consumers means higher prices, right?</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right.  In the Midwest, flooding is a weird one off, too, because what happened there is the ethanol supply which is blended off the coast particularly in California and in New York and East Coast is stranded there.  And the East Coast are scrambling to buy it from Brazil, the West Coast they`ve not had a lot of options, there`s actually been spot shortages.</p><p>So, yes, again, this is something that should pass.  I would point out that the fact that the U.S. is now the world`s number one oil producer at over 12 million barrels, it does cover a multitude of sins.  We would be talking about a very horrific price environment, Sue, if it`s just a couple of years ago --</p><p>HERERA:  Absolutely.</p><p>KILDUFF:  -- when we were nowhere near those levels.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that optimistic note, John Kilduff --</p><p>KILDUFF:  Hang in there, folks.  It will be OK.</p><p>HERERA:  Exactly.  Thanks, John.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, there`s a new threat for the auto industry involving parts and vehicles built in Mexico.  Slowdowns and delays are developing at the border due to the shift on how border patrol agents are being used.</p><p>And as Phil LeBeau reports, that is creating bottlenecks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S.-Mexico border.  Every day, thousands of auto parts and automobiles go back and forth before they eventually wind up in showrooms here in the U.S.</p><p>But in the last week, the president`s push to tighten border security has created serious delays which could wind up slowing down auto plants.</p><p>KRISTIN DZICKZEK, CENTER FOR AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH:  Automakers know what they get from Mexico and they know what they`re not going to get when there is some shipments that are getting through and some aren`t and there are seven-hour delays, and, you know, you`re going to send home half a shift, you`re not going to have, you know, not very smooth production until the whole production system can adjust this.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Last year, more than half of the trucks and cars sold in the U.S. were built in the U.S., with another 15 percent from Mexico, easily outpacing imports from other countries.  It`s where many Chevy Silverado, Ram pickups and other popular models are built.  So far, the supply of new vehicles coming out of Mexico has not been hurt, but if the delays continue and the flow of components or parts slows down, so will assembly lines both in Mexico and the U.S.</p><p>DZICKZEK:  It only takes one missing part to suspend production here in the U.S. and on the other side in Mexico, and the cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico is really quite intense.</p><p>LEBEAU:  It is not uncommon for auto parts to go between the U.S. and Mexico two to three times before they ultimately wind up in a finished vehicle, which is why the auto industry is closely following the tension at the border.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  On Capitol Hill, executives from some of the nation`s largest pharmacy benefit managers testified on the rising price of prescription drugs, and they were on the defensive saying they are not to blame.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Senate Finance Committee heads Chuck Grassley and Ron Wyden say they want to get to the bottom of whether pharmacy benefit contracts put industry profits ahead of consumer prices.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA):  More transparency is needed.  The current system is so opaque that it`s easy to see why there are questions about PBMs motives.</p><p>COOMBS:  PBMs are the middle men who negotiate discounts with drugmakers on prescription drugs for insurance companies and big employers.  Now, drugmakers and others say that those discounts negotiated through secret contracts lead to higher list prices and consumer costs.</p><p>SEN. RON WYDEN (D), OREGON:  I`m of the view that pharmaceutical benefit managers guard their operations with greater secrecy than HBO is guarding the ending of \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>COOMBS:  PBM executives say they support transparency to a point.</p><p>JOHN PRINCE, OPTUMRX CEO:  We have transparency to who hires us.  We also are transparent to the government in terms of disposing it to CMS in terms of rebates.  But if you disclose that to the external market, it would hurt our ability to get a good value for people we negotiate for.</p><p>COOMBS:  Cigna`s Steve Miller defended PBM contracting, noting tough negotiations help produce big savings when expensive hepatitis C drug hit the market.</p><p>STEVEN MILLER, MD, CIGNA (NYSE:CI) CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER:  In the first year, we treated 60,000 patients to cure to achieve higher adherence than the drug`s clinical trial and save patients and health systems over $1 billion.</p><p>COOMBS:  Asked about proposals to cut out the middlemen and the government pricing new drugs, the executives warned it wouldn`t keep drugmakers from raising prices.</p><p>WILLIAM FLEMING, HUMANA HEALTHCARE SERVICES PRESIDENT:  My concern from government to get the negotiation would be higher list prices initially when they come out to offset what the manufacturer would have to give up.</p><p>COOMBS:  The pharmacy benefit firms will be back on Capitol Hill tomorrow, this time along with drugmakers for a hearing in the House, Energy and Commerce Committee that`s focusing on insulin prices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  There was a separate hearing in the news that Wall Street was watching.</p><p>Attorney General Barr testified before the House Appropriations Committee.  He gave lawmakers a timeframe for when the Justice Department will release a redacted copy of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HON. WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with the chairman of both judiciary committees about that report and about any further requests that they have.</p><p>(END VIIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The hearing was intended to focus on the 2020 fiscal budget.</p><p>It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Cowen.  The analyst cites Disney`s product pipeline and says Thursday`s investor day will likely be a debt clearing event for sentiment.  The price target is $131.  The stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $116.86.</p><p>U.S. Steel was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse.  The analyst says U.S. Steel is in a weaker competitive position compared to its peers.  The price target is $13.  The stock fell about 10 percent to $17.77.</p><p>Still ahead, think the retail industry is changing?  Well, a new report says just you wait.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is hiking its minimum wage to $20 an hour.  The CEO says the increase will be implemented over the next two years.  Paychecks will go to $17 at first and then $20 which is the highest minimum wage paid by any of the country`s biggest banks.  The announcement comes one day before bank`s CEOs are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Optimism on Main Street ticked higher last month.  According to the National Federation of independent business, business owners are more optimistic about economic growth and do not expect a recession any time soon.  The survey also points to solid investment spending and hiring.</p><p>Well, the retail industry could use some of that optimism as store closings are projected to accelerate.  According to UBS, nearly 75,000 retail stores will close if online sales reached 25 percent in total retail sales by 2026.</p><p>Michael Lasser joins us.  He`s with UBS to discuss his outlook.  He wrote that report.</p><p>Michael, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>MICHAEL LASSER, UBS RETAIL ANALYST:  Thanks for having me, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Very quickly, how did you come up with that metric and those numbers?</p><p>LASSER:  The way we came up with those metric -- measures is looking at a variety of data from various sources and came up within the sources to determine what`s the equilibrium between the supply of available places to buy goods and the demand to buy goods through physical places.  And what we`re seeing is there are just too many stores in the U.S. and as a result we`re going to see more store closures over time, particularly as e-commerce growth continues to increase.</p><p>HERERA:  You broke it out into different subsectors.  Which subsectors need to close the most stores?</p><p>LASSER:  The way we see it, the subsector that need to close the most stores include those consumer electronics, home furnishings, the apparel sector.  These are areas where we`re seeing continued increases in the rate of online penetration and as a result we suffer from too much capacity in terms of the number of stores that are serving those industries.  As a result they`re the ones that will be at the forefront of store closures over the next several years.</p><p>HERERA:  And how many of these are within enclosed malls versus how many are freestanding?</p><p>LASSER:  It`s a good question, Sue.  Right now, there are about 100 in enclosed malls in the U.S.  A good portion of those enclosed malls include apparel retailers.  And so, that`s going to be the heart of the consolidation in that sector, and we`re going continue to see more and more closures in that area and otherwise we`ll see home furnishings and retailers and clothes within malls and we`re seeing that right now.  We`re going to see a shift from the mall-based retailers to off-mall as a result of the convenience of off-mall shopping.</p><p>HERERA:  Now, there are some sectors in retail that you do like.  So from an investment perspective for those who have a longer term time horizon, you like hard lines, things like Home Depots and Lowe`s and the like, correct?</p><p>LASSER:  That`s correct, Sue.  We like those sectors because there is an element to the sale where the consumer still really values going to the store.  In the case of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe`s, even when doing online sales, about half of those are picked up in the store.</p><p>The same is true in the auto part space for companies like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and O`Reilly and Advance Auto.  So having that Omni-channel presence is very important and you`re seeing less disruption from the online channel.</p><p>HERERA:  Michael Lasser with UBS -- Michael, thank you.</p><p>LASSER:  Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  From the retail sector to the investment that`s historically been popular in retail investors, muni bonds.  And believe it or not, this plain vanilla part of the market is garnering a lot more attention following the passage of the new tax law.</p><p>Robert Frank explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the least glamorous segments of the investing world is suddenly a huge hit with wealthy investors.  Municipal bonds or muni bonds have soared in popularity in recent months as investors look to offset a big tax bill.  Investor flows into muni bonds so far this year have topped $20 billion, that`s it is highest in 13 years.</p><p>The main reason: tax-free income.  Investors who live in high-tech states like New York, New Jersey or California are writing bigger checks to the government this month because of that new cap on state and local tax deductions.  To create more tax-free income, those high earners are putting more money into muni bonds which are exempt from federal income and often state and local income taxes.  So, if you have a 10-year muni bond that yields 2 percent, its taxable equipment could be 4 percent or higher.</p><p>All that demand has driven down yields in the $3.8 trillion market to the lowest levels against Treasury since 2001, and that has been good for the state especially high-tax states that have been fighting the new tax law.  Eight of the ten biggest issuers in the first quarter were in California, New York and Connecticut.  New Jersey and Illinois were also big issuers.  So the tax law has lowered the borrowing cost for the state most opposed to the new tax code.</p><p>California last month issued a $3.3 billion bond deal that had an interest rate of about a third of a percentage point below 2017.  While that doesn`t sound like much, it saves the state about $8 million.  Politicians in those high-tech states saying the gains from the muni bond boom can`t nearly offset the billions that their taxpayers are leaving to Washington.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY:  I think obviously good resource investment into states is a good thing and to help infrastructure.  But this is certainly not a long-term solution.</p><p>FRANK:  The big question for investors is whether the muni mania has gone too far and created a new asset bubble.  For example, yields on munis for Illinois, the lowest rated state in the country, are now below 3.6 percent.  That`s only about a point higher than the U.S. 10-year treasury.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Boeing`s report has declined in deliveries and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Total deliveries were nearly halved in the first quarter following the grounding of Boeing`s popular 737 MAX jet.  Net orders fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier.  There were no new 737 MAX orders during the month of March.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell about 1.5 percent to $369.04.</p><p>And the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet is one of the reasons why American Airlines trimmed its first quarter revenue forecast.  The grounding forced the airline to cancel hundreds of flights.  American says the key revenue metric will now be flat to up 1 percent.  Its prior forecast called for 2 percent growth.  Shares fell more than 1.5 percent to $33.31.</p><p>Levi Strauss reported a 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue and earnings of 37 cents per share.  The CEO described growth at the company as broad based.  Since this was the jeansmaker`s first report since going public, there were no estimates available.  The stock rose in initial after-hours trading after closing the regular session at $21.88.</p><p>There have been a lot of rumblings about regulating big tech companies.  Today, a Senate bill was introduced that takes aim at social media firms and it comes a year after a high-profile executive was called to Capitol Hill.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is back with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAUSCHE:  It`s been a year since Mark Zuckerberg embarked on his apology tour after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  We didn`t take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake, and it was my mistake and I`m sorry.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  A cascade of hearings since then.  Executives from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) testifying on everything from privacy to political bias, though progress on reining in social companies has been slow.  But today, Virginia Senator Mark Warner took another run at regulation running up a first in the series of bills to challenge business as usual.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  Mark Zuckerberg put in an editorial in a paper a week ago saying, calling for more regulation.  I think the platform companies will now have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is to see whether they support this legislation and other approaches.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  The bell would ban a practice called \"dark patterns\" where users are forced to share their data or opt into terms set by the company in order to use a product.  It would create a new regulator under the new Federal Trade Commission to be a cop on the beat.</p><p>A bipartisan group is working on a broader package of privacy safeguards.  Warner hopes his bill co-sponsored by Nebraska Republican Deb Fisher would get adopted by the group, whether it could pass large regulation into law by 2020 is uncertain.  But California`s effort is certain, new consumer processions set to become law next year.</p><p>JASON HELFSTEIN, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.:  If Congress doesn`t pass a national kind of privacy law, will go into effect January of next year and it`s quite onerous.  And I think you`re seeing can the companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) trying to get in front of it.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  That effort includes frequent face time in Washington with regulators, lawmakers and the president, and the record amount of spending on lobbying.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) spent $35 million in 2018, a roughly 15 percent increase from the prior year.  Twitter`s lobbying spent double.</p><p>That money is to influence bills that have not been written, but the biggest cost could come from investigations at the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and housing and urban development that could lobby massive fines on tech companies.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, we often talk about rising home prices, but in some markets rental costs are a real issue.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Home sales may be heating up this week, but renters aren`t getting a break.  In fact, rents have turned higher yet again and in some markets, affordability has become a significant challenge.</p><p>Diana Olick breaks down the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you`re looking to rent an apartment, it may take you a while to find one.  The vacancy rate at the end of last year fell to the lowest level since 1999.  This, even as more renters become buyers.</p><p>GREG WILLETT, REALPAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Resident retention when leases come up for renewal is at record level.  So while you might be losing more people to home purchase, they`re moving less frequently for job change or for change in household configuration.</p><p>OLICK:  Low vacancy means landlords can charge higher rents.  Rents backed off a little bit in 2017 and for much of last year as new apartments supply hit the market.  But rents are turning higher again now, and in some markets, the gains are causing real burdens for renters.  The worst, Miami, San Diego, L.A, New York and Orlando, according to a new survey from Freddie Mac.</p><p>In this markets, renters are paying well more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent, in some cases, even half their incomes.</p><p>San Francisco has the second highest rent in the country but is ranked 13th on the list of most rent burden.  That`s because salaries there are high.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely keep me from saving what I want to actually spend on.  So, I mean, pretty much having a roof over my head over going to try to save up for a nice car or a nice vacation is just kind of heartbreaking.</p><p>OLICK:  Even renters in luxury buildings won`t catch a break.  They have been seeing some good deals that so much new product was being completed in the last few years and landlords were offering incentive, but not so much now.</p><p>WILLETT:  You get that initial resident space built and when renewal leases come up, you can push the pricing a little bit.</p><p>OLICK:  Overall, rents are now rising at about the same pace as wage growth.  So, while too many Americans are still burdened by high rents, the bright side might be that unlike five years ago when rents were soaring, the situation this year may not get much better, but it won`t get worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The S&amp;P ends its string of gains thanks to fresh trade tensions and the possibility that they may never fully go away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Border bottleneck.  The auto industry faces a new challenge and it`s coming from the dividing line between the U.S. and Mexico.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And rising rents.  Why it`s not just home prices that are sky high in some markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, April 9th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Bill is off this evening.</p><p>There was a sense of nervousness on Wall Street today not only because earnings season is about to start, but also because of trade.  That caused the S&amp;P 500 to halt an eight-day rally and push the treasury yields lower.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190 points to 26,150.  The Nasdaq dropped 44 and the S&amp;P 500 gave back 17.</p><p>And today`s trade issue wasn`t about China.  Instead, it was about the European Union.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It`s the latest salvo in the U.S.-Europe trade dispute, which had gone mostly quiet since the truce last August.  But it`s ramping up again.  The U.S. trade representative outlining $11 billion in European goods subject to new tariffs including aircraft, wine and 40 different types of cheese.</p><p>It`s retaliation for Europe`s subsidies on Boeing (NYSE:BA) competitor Airbus.  President Trump tweeting that the E.U. has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years, it will soon stop.  It`s not clear how high the tariffs would be or when they would go into effect.  But three White House aides tell me the goal on trade policy is to pivot the negotiations with Europe which have stalled once China trade talks have concluded.</p><p>The Trump administration has a May 18th deadline to chart its next steps on auto tariffs which will largely impact Europe.  Hence, why President Trump suggested a four-week time frame for China talks, said they would end before that date.  China said it`s not committed to that timeline and Brussels called the new terror threat exaggerated.  But President Trump has shown he`s not one to back down.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Much of the focus investors have been on trade relations with China and a hope for a deal between the world`s two largest economies.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that might not signal the end of the trade story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market commentary sees tariffs in the trade war as temporary events.  A U.S.-China trade deal, the thinking goes, will sound the all-clear signal for markets and the economy, but their indications may be in for a longer, more protracted trade battle, a forever trade war that could last the balance of the Trump administration.</p><p>The chief economist of the IMF which downgraded global and U.S. growth today cited specific concerns for ongoing trade battles.</p><p>GITA GOPINATH, IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST:  There has been improvement on the front between the U.S. and China, and a possible agreement in the near future.  You know, we are worried about trade tensions escalating in other sectors like the auto sector, and that is particularly damaging given that it`s a highly integrated sector for the large global supply chains.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Consider these developments.  The tariffs remain in place for Mexico and Canada even after the U.S. struck a trade deal with the two countries.  The U.S. wants to retain the right to put tariffs on China even after they signed a trade deal.</p><p>Finally, in just the past couple of days, the U.S. threatened the European Union with tariffs on aircrafts and autos could be next.</p><p>Art Hogan, chief market strategist with National Security, says if the administration decides to pivot immediately to tariffs on European autos, any positive momentum derived from an end to U.S.-China trade war will dissipate rapidly.  It could be that tariffs are a negotiating tool and another explanation could be that the administration could keep tariffs in place for years in order to protect U.S. industries have permanently reduced imports.  If the goal is bringing back manufacturing loss to China and other chief competitors, then temporary tariffs won`t do.  If that`s the goal, markets should prepare for permanent trade barriers and possibly a forever trade war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The number of job openings fell to an 11-month low in February.  According to the Labor Department, the measure dropped by 538,000 to 7.1 million.  That`s the lowest level since March of last year.  But the decline is off of near record levels and if you recall the government employment report that month showed a sharp dip, but only to bounce back in March.</p><p>Oil prices fell today, but that has not been the trend.  Domestic crude is up about 40 percent this year.  There have been recent rumblings about violence in Libya that have been impacted by sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.</p><p>So we brought in John Kilduff.  He joins us now to talk more about what`s happening in the oil market and what it means to you.  He is founding partner at Again Capital.</p><p>Welcome back, John.</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL:  Good evening, Sue.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s start with Libya and the possible impact that it is having on oil prices right now.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right, it`s sort of the icing on a bad cake for consumers at this point.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Basically, we`ve had warring factions in Libya for a year since Moammar Gadhafi, the former dictator, was overthrown and ultimately killed.  There is a consolidation now of power going on.  There is a general by the name of Haftar that has marshaled his resources.  He already controls the eastern part of Libya and the oil is falling there.  He is now making a move to consolidate the rest of the country and the battle for Tripoli, the capital is on so to speak.</p><p>I`m getting the sense that he`ll prevail and that the situation will revert to the way it was when Moammar Gadhafi was there, a sort of heavy handed force on an otherwise tribally organized country.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Which is good news for consumers because the oil will flow.</p><p>HERERA:  The oil will flow.  It is not flowing for other parts of the country, of the world, rather and the whole situation is really exacerbated by the fact that we`ve had some refining issues here at home, correct?  I mean, we`ve had bad weather in certain places and catastrophes in others.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right, and sort of the one-two punch is this.  You have Venezuela imploding because of what`s happening in that country and its involvement into just zero oil production at some point here.  Also, too, you have a very committed Saudi Arabia that`s working hard to reduce global supplies and they`ve undercut their quota by quite a bit.  So, that has tightened the market.</p><p>So, now, you add Venezuela getting worse and worse and you add the Iran sanctions and now you add problems with the U.S. refiners and it sort of gets the cauldron boiled up from time to time.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, we`ve had major fires at U.S. refineries and we`ve had the Mideast flooding.  All of this for consumers means higher prices, right?</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right.  In the Midwest, flooding is a weird one off, too, because what happened there is the ethanol supply which is blended off the coast particularly in California and in New York and East Coast is stranded there.  And the East Coast are scrambling to buy it from Brazil, the West Coast they`ve not had a lot of options, there`s actually been spot shortages.</p><p>So, yes, again, this is something that should pass.  I would point out that the fact that the U.S. is now the world`s number one oil producer at over 12 million barrels, it does cover a multitude of sins.  We would be talking about a very horrific price environment, Sue, if it`s just a couple of years ago --</p><p>HERERA:  Absolutely.</p><p>KILDUFF:  -- when we were nowhere near those levels.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that optimistic note, John Kilduff --</p><p>KILDUFF:  Hang in there, folks.  It will be OK.</p><p>HERERA:  Exactly.  Thanks, John.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, there`s a new threat for the auto industry involving parts and vehicles built in Mexico.  Slowdowns and delays are developing at the border due to the shift on how border patrol agents are being used.</p><p>And as Phil LeBeau reports, that is creating bottlenecks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S.-Mexico border.  Every day, thousands of auto parts and automobiles go back and forth before they eventually wind up in showrooms here in the U.S.</p><p>But in the last week, the president`s push to tighten border security has created serious delays which could wind up slowing down auto plants.</p><p>KRISTIN DZICKZEK, CENTER FOR AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH:  Automakers know what they get from Mexico and they know what they`re not going to get when there is some shipments that are getting through and some aren`t and there are seven-hour delays, and, you know, you`re going to send home half a shift, you`re not going to have, you know, not very smooth production until the whole production system can adjust this.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Last year, more than half of the trucks and cars sold in the U.S. were built in the U.S., with another 15 percent from Mexico, easily outpacing imports from other countries.  It`s where many Chevy Silverado, Ram pickups and other popular models are built.  So far, the supply of new vehicles coming out of Mexico has not been hurt, but if the delays continue and the flow of components or parts slows down, so will assembly lines both in Mexico and the U.S.</p><p>DZICKZEK:  It only takes one missing part to suspend production here in the U.S. and on the other side in Mexico, and the cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico is really quite intense.</p><p>LEBEAU:  It is not uncommon for auto parts to go between the U.S. and Mexico two to three times before they ultimately wind up in a finished vehicle, which is why the auto industry is closely following the tension at the border.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  On Capitol Hill, executives from some of the nation`s largest pharmacy benefit managers testified on the rising price of prescription drugs, and they were on the defensive saying they are not to blame.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Senate Finance Committee heads Chuck Grassley and Ron Wyden say they want to get to the bottom of whether pharmacy benefit contracts put industry profits ahead of consumer prices.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA):  More transparency is needed.  The current system is so opaque that it`s easy to see why there are questions about PBMs motives.</p><p>COOMBS:  PBMs are the middle men who negotiate discounts with drugmakers on prescription drugs for insurance companies and big employers.  Now, drugmakers and others say that those discounts negotiated through secret contracts lead to higher list prices and consumer costs.</p><p>SEN. RON WYDEN (D), OREGON:  I`m of the view that pharmaceutical benefit managers guard their operations with greater secrecy than HBO is guarding the ending of \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>COOMBS:  PBM executives say they support transparency to a point.</p><p>JOHN PRINCE, OPTUMRX CEO:  We have transparency to who hires us.  We also are transparent to the government in terms of disposing it to CMS in terms of rebates.  But if you disclose that to the external market, it would hurt our ability to get a good value for people we negotiate for.</p><p>COOMBS:  Cigna`s Steve Miller defended PBM contracting, noting tough negotiations help produce big savings when expensive hepatitis C drug hit the market.</p><p>STEVEN MILLER, MD, CIGNA (NYSE:CI) CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER:  In the first year, we treated 60,000 patients to cure to achieve higher adherence than the drug`s clinical trial and save patients and health systems over $1 billion.</p><p>COOMBS:  Asked about proposals to cut out the middlemen and the government pricing new drugs, the executives warned it wouldn`t keep drugmakers from raising prices.</p><p>WILLIAM FLEMING, HUMANA HEALTHCARE SERVICES PRESIDENT:  My concern from government to get the negotiation would be higher list prices initially when they come out to offset what the manufacturer would have to give up.</p><p>COOMBS:  The pharmacy benefit firms will be back on Capitol Hill tomorrow, this time along with drugmakers for a hearing in the House, Energy and Commerce Committee that`s focusing on insulin prices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  There was a separate hearing in the news that Wall Street was watching.</p><p>Attorney General Barr testified before the House Appropriations Committee.  He gave lawmakers a timeframe for when the Justice Department will release a redacted copy of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HON. WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with the chairman of both judiciary committees about that report and about any further requests that they have.</p><p>(END VIIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The hearing was intended to focus on the 2020 fiscal budget.</p><p>It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Cowen.  The analyst cites Disney`s product pipeline and says Thursday`s investor day will likely be a debt clearing event for sentiment.  The price target is $131.  The stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $116.86.</p><p>U.S. Steel was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse.  The analyst says U.S. Steel is in a weaker competitive position compared to its peers.  The price target is $13.  The stock fell about 10 percent to $17.77.</p><p>Still ahead, think the retail industry is changing?  Well, a new report says just you wait.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is hiking its minimum wage to $20 an hour.  The CEO says the increase will be implemented over the next two years.  Paychecks will go to $17 at first and then $20 which is the highest minimum wage paid by any of the country`s biggest banks.  The announcement comes one day before bank`s CEOs are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Optimism on Main Street ticked higher last month.  According to the National Federation of independent business, business owners are more optimistic about economic growth and do not expect a recession any time soon.  The survey also points to solid investment spending and hiring.</p><p>Well, the retail industry could use some of that optimism as store closings are projected to accelerate.  According to UBS, nearly 75,000 retail stores will close if online sales reached 25 percent in total retail sales by 2026.</p><p>Michael Lasser joins us.  He`s with UBS to discuss his outlook.  He wrote that report.</p><p>Michael, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>MICHAEL LASSER, UBS RETAIL ANALYST:  Thanks for having me, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Very quickly, how did you come up with that metric and those numbers?</p><p>LASSER:  The way we came up with those metric -- measures is looking at a variety of data from various sources and came up within the sources to determine what`s the equilibrium between the supply of available places to buy goods and the demand to buy goods through physical places.  And what we`re seeing is there are just too many stores in the U.S. and as a result we`re going to see more store closures over time, particularly as e-commerce growth continues to increase.</p><p>HERERA:  You broke it out into different subsectors.  Which subsectors need to close the most stores?</p><p>LASSER:  The way we see it, the subsector that need to close the most stores include those consumer electronics, home furnishings, the apparel sector.  These are areas where we`re seeing continued increases in the rate of online penetration and as a result we suffer from too much capacity in terms of the number of stores that are serving those industries.  As a result they`re the ones that will be at the forefront of store closures over the next several years.</p><p>HERERA:  And how many of these are within enclosed malls versus how many are freestanding?</p><p>LASSER:  It`s a good question, Sue.  Right now, there are about 100 in enclosed malls in the U.S.  A good portion of those enclosed malls include apparel retailers.  And so, that`s going to be the heart of the consolidation in that sector, and we`re going continue to see more and more closures in that area and otherwise we`ll see home furnishings and retailers and clothes within malls and we`re seeing that right now.  We`re going to see a shift from the mall-based retailers to off-mall as a result of the convenience of off-mall shopping.</p><p>HERERA:  Now, there are some sectors in retail that you do like.  So from an investment perspective for those who have a longer term time horizon, you like hard lines, things like Home Depots and Lowe`s and the like, correct?</p><p>LASSER:  That`s correct, Sue.  We like those sectors because there is an element to the sale where the consumer still really values going to the store.  In the case of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe`s, even when doing online sales, about half of those are picked up in the store.</p><p>The same is true in the auto part space for companies like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and O`Reilly and Advance Auto.  So having that Omni-channel presence is very important and you`re seeing less disruption from the online channel.</p><p>HERERA:  Michael Lasser with UBS -- Michael, thank you.</p><p>LASSER:  Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  From the retail sector to the investment that`s historically been popular in retail investors, muni bonds.  And believe it or not, this plain vanilla part of the market is garnering a lot more attention following the passage of the new tax law.</p><p>Robert Frank explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the least glamorous segments of the investing world is suddenly a huge hit with wealthy investors.  Municipal bonds or muni bonds have soared in popularity in recent months as investors look to offset a big tax bill.  Investor flows into muni bonds so far this year have topped $20 billion, that`s it is highest in 13 years.</p><p>The main reason: tax-free income.  Investors who live in high-tech states like New York, New Jersey or California are writing bigger checks to the government this month because of that new cap on state and local tax deductions.  To create more tax-free income, those high earners are putting more money into muni bonds which are exempt from federal income and often state and local income taxes.  So, if you have a 10-year muni bond that yields 2 percent, its taxable equipment could be 4 percent or higher.</p><p>All that demand has driven down yields in the $3.8 trillion market to the lowest levels against Treasury since 2001, and that has been good for the state especially high-tax states that have been fighting the new tax law.  Eight of the ten biggest issuers in the first quarter were in California, New York and Connecticut.  New Jersey and Illinois were also big issuers.  So the tax law has lowered the borrowing cost for the state most opposed to the new tax code.</p><p>California last month issued a $3.3 billion bond deal that had an interest rate of about a third of a percentage point below 2017.  While that doesn`t sound like much, it saves the state about $8 million.  Politicians in those high-tech states saying the gains from the muni bond boom can`t nearly offset the billions that their taxpayers are leaving to Washington.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY:  I think obviously good resource investment into states is a good thing and to help infrastructure.  But this is certainly not a long-term solution.</p><p>FRANK:  The big question for investors is whether the muni mania has gone too far and created a new asset bubble.  For example, yields on munis for Illinois, the lowest rated state in the country, are now below 3.6 percent.  That`s only about a point higher than the U.S. 10-year treasury.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Boeing`s report has declined in deliveries and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Total deliveries were nearly halved in the first quarter following the grounding of Boeing`s popular 737 MAX jet.  Net orders fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier.  There were no new 737 MAX orders during the month of March.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell about 1.5 percent to $369.04.</p><p>And the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet is one of the reasons why American Airlines trimmed its first quarter revenue forecast.  The grounding forced the airline to cancel hundreds of flights.  American says the key revenue metric will now be flat to up 1 percent.  Its prior forecast called for 2 percent growth.  Shares fell more than 1.5 percent to $33.31.</p><p>Levi Strauss reported a 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue and earnings of 37 cents per share.  The CEO described growth at the company as broad based.  Since this was the jeansmaker`s first report since going public, there were no estimates available.  The stock rose in initial after-hours trading after closing the regular session at $21.88.</p><p>There have been a lot of rumblings about regulating big tech companies.  Today, a Senate bill was introduced that takes aim at social media firms and it comes a year after a high-profile executive was called to Capitol Hill.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is back with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAUSCHE:  It`s been a year since Mark Zuckerberg embarked on his apology tour after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  We didn`t take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake, and it was my mistake and I`m sorry.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  A cascade of hearings since then.  Executives from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) testifying on everything from privacy to political bias, though progress on reining in social companies has been slow.  But today, Virginia Senator Mark Warner took another run at regulation running up a first in the series of bills to challenge business as usual.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  Mark Zuckerberg put in an editorial in a paper a week ago saying, calling for more regulation.  I think the platform companies will now have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is to see whether they support this legislation and other approaches.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  The bell would ban a practice called \"dark patterns\" where users are forced to share their data or opt into terms set by the company in order to use a product.  It would create a new regulator under the new Federal Trade Commission to be a cop on the beat.</p><p>A bipartisan group is working on a broader package of privacy safeguards.  Warner hopes his bill co-sponsored by Nebraska Republican Deb Fisher would get adopted by the group, whether it could pass large regulation into law by 2020 is uncertain.  But California`s effort is certain, new consumer processions set to become law next year.</p><p>JASON HELFSTEIN, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.:  If Congress doesn`t pass a national kind of privacy law, will go into effect January of next year and it`s quite onerous.  And I think you`re seeing can the companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) trying to get in front of it.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  That effort includes frequent face time in Washington with regulators, lawmakers and the president, and the record amount of spending on lobbying.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) spent $35 million in 2018, a roughly 15 percent increase from the prior year.  Twitter`s lobbying spent double.</p><p>That money is to influence bills that have not been written, but the biggest cost could come from investigations at the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and housing and urban development that could lobby massive fines on tech companies.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, we often talk about rising home prices, but in some markets rental costs are a real issue.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Home sales may be heating up this week, but renters aren`t getting a break.  In fact, rents have turned higher yet again and in some markets, affordability has become a significant challenge.</p><p>Diana Olick breaks down the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you`re looking to rent an apartment, it may take you a while to find one.  The vacancy rate at the end of last year fell to the lowest level since 1999.  This, even as more renters become buyers.</p><p>GREG WILLETT, REALPAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Resident retention when leases come up for renewal is at record level.  So while you might be losing more people to home purchase, they`re moving less frequently for job change or for change in household configuration.</p><p>OLICK:  Low vacancy means landlords can charge higher rents.  Rents backed off a little bit in 2017 and for much of last year as new apartments supply hit the market.  But rents are turning higher again now, and in some markets, the gains are causing real burdens for renters.  The worst, Miami, San Diego, L.A, New York and Orlando, according to a new survey from Freddie Mac.</p><p>In this markets, renters are paying well more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent, in some cases, even half their incomes.</p><p>San Francisco has the second highest rent in the country but is ranked 13th on the list of most rent burden.  That`s because salaries there are high.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely keep me from saving what I want to actually spend on.  So, I mean, pretty much having a roof over my head over going to try to save up for a nice car or a nice vacation is just kind of heartbreaking.</p><p>OLICK:  Even renters in luxury buildings won`t catch a break.  They have been seeing some good deals that so much new product was being completed in the last few years and landlords were offering incentive, but not so much now.</p><p>WILLETT:  You get that initial resident space built and when renewal leases come up, you can push the pricing a little bit.</p><p>OLICK:  Overall, rents are now rising at about the same pace as wage growth.  So, while too many Americans are still burdened by high rents, the bright side might be that unlike five years ago when rents were soaring, the situation this year may not get much better, but it won`t get worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

Bill is off this evening.</p><p>There was a sense of nervousness on Wall Street today not only because earnings season is about to start, but also because of trade.  That caused the S&amp;P 500 to halt an eight-day rally and push the treasury yields lower.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190 points to 26,150.  The Nasdaq dropped 44 and the S&amp;P 500 gave back 17.</p><p>And today`s trade issue wasn`t about China.  Instead, it was about the European Union.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It`s the latest salvo in the U.S.-Europe trade dispute, which had gone mostly quiet since the truce last August.  But it`s ramping up again.  The U.S. trade representative outlining $11 billion in European goods subject to new tariffs including aircraft, wine and 40 different types of cheese.</p><p>It`s retaliation for Europe`s subsidies on Boeing (NYSE:BA) competitor Airbus.  President Trump tweeting that the E.U. has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years, it will soon stop.  It`s not clear how high the tariffs would be or when they would go into effect.  But three White House aides tell me the goal on trade policy is to pivot the negotiations with Europe which have stalled once China trade talks have concluded.</p><p>The Trump administration has a May 18th deadline to chart its next steps on auto tariffs which will largely impact Europe.  Hence, why President Trump suggested a four-week time frame for China talks, said they would end before that date.  China said it`s not committed to that timeline and Brussels called the new terror threat exaggerated.  But President Trump has shown he`s not one to back down.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Much of the focus investors have been on trade relations with China and a hope for a deal between the world`s two largest economies.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that might not signal the end of the trade story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market commentary sees tariffs in the trade war as temporary events.  A U.S.-China trade deal, the thinking goes, will sound the all-clear signal for markets and the economy, but their indications may be in for a longer, more protracted trade battle, a forever trade war that could last the balance of the Trump administration.</p><p>The chief economist of the IMF which downgraded global and U.S. growth today cited specific concerns for ongoing trade battles.</p><p>GITA GOPINATH, IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST:  There has been improvement on the front between the U.S. and China, and a possible agreement in the near future.  You know, we are worried about trade tensions escalating in other sectors like the auto sector, and that is particularly damaging given that it`s a highly integrated sector for the large global supply chains.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Consider these developments.  The tariffs remain in place for Mexico and Canada even after the U.S. struck a trade deal with the two countries.  The U.S. wants to retain the right to put tariffs on China even after they signed a trade deal.</p><p>Finally, in just the past couple of days, the U.S. threatened the European Union with tariffs on aircrafts and autos could be next.</p><p>Art Hogan, chief market strategist with National Security, says if the administration decides to pivot immediately to tariffs on European autos, any positive momentum derived from an end to U.S.-China trade war will dissipate rapidly.  It could be that tariffs are a negotiating tool and another explanation could be that the administration could keep tariffs in place for years in order to protect U.S. industries have permanently reduced imports.  If the goal is bringing back manufacturing loss to China and other chief competitors, then temporary tariffs won`t do.  If that`s the goal, markets should prepare for permanent trade barriers and possibly a forever trade war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The number of job openings fell to an 11-month low in February.  According to the Labor Department, the measure dropped by 538,000 to 7.1 million.  That`s the lowest level since March of last year.  But the decline is off of near record levels and if you recall the government employment report that month showed a sharp dip, but only to bounce back in March.</p><p>Oil prices fell today, but that has not been the trend.  Domestic crude is up about 40 percent this year.  There have been recent rumblings about violence in Libya that have been impacted by sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.</p><p>So we brought in John Kilduff.  He joins us now to talk more about what`s happening in the oil market and what it means to you.  He is founding partner at Again Capital.</p><p>Welcome back, John.</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL:  Good evening, Sue.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s start with Libya and the possible impact that it is having on oil prices right now.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right, it`s sort of the icing on a bad cake for consumers at this point.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Basically, we`ve had warring factions in Libya for a year since Moammar Gadhafi, the former dictator, was overthrown and ultimately killed.  There is a consolidation now of power going on.  There is a general by the name of Haftar that has marshaled his resources.  He already controls the eastern part of Libya and the oil is falling there.  He is now making a move to consolidate the rest of the country and the battle for Tripoli, the capital is on so to speak.</p><p>I`m getting the sense that he`ll prevail and that the situation will revert to the way it was when Moammar Gadhafi was there, a sort of heavy handed force on an otherwise tribally organized country.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Which is good news for consumers because the oil will flow.</p><p>HERERA:  The oil will flow.  It is not flowing for other parts of the country, of the world, rather and the whole situation is really exacerbated by the fact that we`ve had some refining issues here at home, correct?  I mean, we`ve had bad weather in certain places and catastrophes in others.</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right, and sort of the one-two punch is this.  You have Venezuela imploding because of what`s happening in that country and its involvement into just zero oil production at some point here.  Also, too, you have a very committed Saudi Arabia that`s working hard to reduce global supplies and they`ve undercut their quota by quite a bit.  So, that has tightened the market.</p><p>So, now, you add Venezuela getting worse and worse and you add the Iran sanctions and now you add problems with the U.S. refiners and it sort of gets the cauldron boiled up from time to time.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, we`ve had major fires at U.S. refineries and we`ve had the Mideast flooding.  All of this for consumers means higher prices, right?</p><p>KILDUFF:  Right.  In the Midwest, flooding is a weird one off, too, because what happened there is the ethanol supply which is blended off the coast particularly in California and in New York and East Coast is stranded there.  And the East Coast are scrambling to buy it from Brazil, the West Coast they`ve not had a lot of options, there`s actually been spot shortages.</p><p>So, yes, again, this is something that should pass.  I would point out that the fact that the U.S. is now the world`s number one oil producer at over 12 million barrels, it does cover a multitude of sins.  We would be talking about a very horrific price environment, Sue, if it`s just a couple of years ago --</p><p>HERERA:  Absolutely.</p><p>KILDUFF:  -- when we were nowhere near those levels.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that optimistic note, John Kilduff --</p><p>KILDUFF:  Hang in there, folks.  It will be OK.</p><p>HERERA:  Exactly.  Thanks, John.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, there`s a new threat for the auto industry involving parts and vehicles built in Mexico.  Slowdowns and delays are developing at the border due to the shift on how border patrol agents are being used.</p><p>And as Phil LeBeau reports, that is creating bottlenecks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S.-Mexico border.  Every day, thousands of auto parts and automobiles go back and forth before they eventually wind up in showrooms here in the U.S.</p><p>But in the last week, the president`s push to tighten border security has created serious delays which could wind up slowing down auto plants.</p><p>KRISTIN DZICKZEK, CENTER FOR AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH:  Automakers know what they get from Mexico and they know what they`re not going to get when there is some shipments that are getting through and some aren`t and there are seven-hour delays, and, you know, you`re going to send home half a shift, you`re not going to have, you know, not very smooth production until the whole production system can adjust this.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Last year, more than half of the trucks and cars sold in the U.S. were built in the U.S., with another 15 percent from Mexico, easily outpacing imports from other countries.  It`s where many Chevy Silverado, Ram pickups and other popular models are built.  So far, the supply of new vehicles coming out of Mexico has not been hurt, but if the delays continue and the flow of components or parts slows down, so will assembly lines both in Mexico and the U.S.</p><p>DZICKZEK:  It only takes one missing part to suspend production here in the U.S. and on the other side in Mexico, and the cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico is really quite intense.</p><p>LEBEAU:  It is not uncommon for auto parts to go between the U.S. and Mexico two to three times before they ultimately wind up in a finished vehicle, which is why the auto industry is closely following the tension at the border.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  On Capitol Hill, executives from some of the nation`s largest pharmacy benefit managers testified on the rising price of prescription drugs, and they were on the defensive saying they are not to blame.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Senate Finance Committee heads Chuck Grassley and Ron Wyden say they want to get to the bottom of whether pharmacy benefit contracts put industry profits ahead of consumer prices.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA):  More transparency is needed.  The current system is so opaque that it`s easy to see why there are questions about PBMs motives.</p><p>COOMBS:  PBMs are the middle men who negotiate discounts with drugmakers on prescription drugs for insurance companies and big employers.  Now, drugmakers and others say that those discounts negotiated through secret contracts lead to higher list prices and consumer costs.</p><p>SEN. RON WYDEN (D), OREGON:  I`m of the view that pharmaceutical benefit managers guard their operations with greater secrecy than HBO is guarding the ending of \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>COOMBS:  PBM executives say they support transparency to a point.</p><p>JOHN PRINCE, OPTUMRX CEO:  We have transparency to who hires us.  We also are transparent to the government in terms of disposing it to CMS in terms of rebates.  But if you disclose that to the external market, it would hurt our ability to get a good value for people we negotiate for.</p><p>COOMBS:  Cigna`s Steve Miller defended PBM contracting, noting tough negotiations help produce big savings when expensive hepatitis C drug hit the market.</p><p>STEVEN MILLER, MD, CIGNA (NYSE:CI) CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER:  In the first year, we treated 60,000 patients to cure to achieve higher adherence than the drug`s clinical trial and save patients and health systems over $1 billion.</p><p>COOMBS:  Asked about proposals to cut out the middlemen and the government pricing new drugs, the executives warned it wouldn`t keep drugmakers from raising prices.</p><p>WILLIAM FLEMING, HUMANA HEALTHCARE SERVICES PRESIDENT:  My concern from government to get the negotiation would be higher list prices initially when they come out to offset what the manufacturer would have to give up.</p><p>COOMBS:  The pharmacy benefit firms will be back on Capitol Hill tomorrow, this time along with drugmakers for a hearing in the House, Energy and Commerce Committee that`s focusing on insulin prices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  There was a separate hearing in the news that Wall Street was watching.</p><p>Attorney General Barr testified before the House Appropriations Committee.  He gave lawmakers a timeframe for when the Justice Department will release a redacted copy of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HON. WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with the chairman of both judiciary committees about that report and about any further requests that they have.</p><p>(END VIIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The hearing was intended to focus on the 2020 fiscal budget.</p><p>It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Cowen.  The analyst cites Disney`s product pipeline and says Thursday`s investor day will likely be a debt clearing event for sentiment.  The price target is $131.  The stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $116.86.</p><p>U.S. Steel was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse.  The analyst says U.S. Steel is in a weaker competitive position compared to its peers.  The price target is $13.  The stock fell about 10 percent to $17.77.</p><p>Still ahead, think the retail industry is changing?  Well, a new report says just you wait.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is hiking its minimum wage to $20 an hour.  The CEO says the increase will be implemented over the next two years.  Paychecks will go to $17 at first and then $20 which is the highest minimum wage paid by any of the country`s biggest banks.  The announcement comes one day before bank`s CEOs are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Optimism on Main Street ticked higher last month.  According to the National Federation of independent business, business owners are more optimistic about economic growth and do not expect a recession any time soon.  The survey also points to solid investment spending and hiring.</p><p>Well, the retail industry could use some of that optimism as store closings are projected to accelerate.  According to UBS, nearly 75,000 retail stores will close if online sales reached 25 percent in total retail sales by 2026.</p><p>Michael Lasser joins us.  He`s with UBS to discuss his outlook.  He wrote that report.</p><p>Michael, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>MICHAEL LASSER, UBS RETAIL ANALYST:  Thanks for having me, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Very quickly, how did you come up with that metric and those numbers?</p><p>LASSER:  The way we came up with those metric -- measures is looking at a variety of data from various sources and came up within the sources to determine what`s the equilibrium between the supply of available places to buy goods and the demand to buy goods through physical places.  And what we`re seeing is there are just too many stores in the U.S. and as a result we`re going to see more store closures over time, particularly as e-commerce growth continues to increase.</p><p>HERERA:  You broke it out into different subsectors.  Which subsectors need to close the most stores?</p><p>LASSER:  The way we see it, the subsector that need to close the most stores include those consumer electronics, home furnishings, the apparel sector.  These are areas where we`re seeing continued increases in the rate of online penetration and as a result we suffer from too much capacity in terms of the number of stores that are serving those industries.  As a result they`re the ones that will be at the forefront of store closures over the next several years.</p><p>HERERA:  And how many of these are within enclosed malls versus how many are freestanding?</p><p>LASSER:  It`s a good question, Sue.  Right now, there are about 100 in enclosed malls in the U.S.  A good portion of those enclosed malls include apparel retailers.  And so, that`s going to be the heart of the consolidation in that sector, and we`re going continue to see more and more closures in that area and otherwise we`ll see home furnishings and retailers and clothes within malls and we`re seeing that right now.  We`re going to see a shift from the mall-based retailers to off-mall as a result of the convenience of off-mall shopping.</p><p>HERERA:  Now, there are some sectors in retail that you do like.  So from an investment perspective for those who have a longer term time horizon, you like hard lines, things like Home Depots and Lowe`s and the like, correct?</p><p>LASSER:  That`s correct, Sue.  We like those sectors because there is an element to the sale where the consumer still really values going to the store.  In the case of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe`s, even when doing online sales, about half of those are picked up in the store.</p><p>The same is true in the auto part space for companies like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and O`Reilly and Advance Auto.  So having that Omni-channel presence is very important and you`re seeing less disruption from the online channel.</p><p>HERERA:  Michael Lasser with UBS -- Michael, thank you.</p><p>LASSER:  Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  From the retail sector to the investment that`s historically been popular in retail investors, muni bonds.  And believe it or not, this plain vanilla part of the market is garnering a lot more attention following the passage of the new tax law.</p><p>Robert Frank explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the least glamorous segments of the investing world is suddenly a huge hit with wealthy investors.  Municipal bonds or muni bonds have soared in popularity in recent months as investors look to offset a big tax bill.  Investor flows into muni bonds so far this year have topped $20 billion, that`s it is highest in 13 years.</p><p>The main reason: tax-free income.  Investors who live in high-tech states like New York, New Jersey or California are writing bigger checks to the government this month because of that new cap on state and local tax deductions.  To create more tax-free income, those high earners are putting more money into muni bonds which are exempt from federal income and often state and local income taxes.  So, if you have a 10-year muni bond that yields 2 percent, its taxable equipment could be 4 percent or higher.</p><p>All that demand has driven down yields in the $3.8 trillion market to the lowest levels against Treasury since 2001, and that has been good for the state especially high-tax states that have been fighting the new tax law.  Eight of the ten biggest issuers in the first quarter were in California, New York and Connecticut.  New Jersey and Illinois were also big issuers.  So the tax law has lowered the borrowing cost for the state most opposed to the new tax code.</p><p>California last month issued a $3.3 billion bond deal that had an interest rate of about a third of a percentage point below 2017.  While that doesn`t sound like much, it saves the state about $8 million.  Politicians in those high-tech states saying the gains from the muni bond boom can`t nearly offset the billions that their taxpayers are leaving to Washington.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY:  I think obviously good resource investment into states is a good thing and to help infrastructure.  But this is certainly not a long-term solution.</p><p>FRANK:  The big question for investors is whether the muni mania has gone too far and created a new asset bubble.  For example, yields on munis for Illinois, the lowest rated state in the country, are now below 3.6 percent.  That`s only about a point higher than the U.S. 10-year treasury.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Boeing`s report has declined in deliveries and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Total deliveries were nearly halved in the first quarter following the grounding of Boeing`s popular 737 MAX jet.  Net orders fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier.  There were no new 737 MAX orders during the month of March.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell about 1.5 percent to $369.04.</p><p>And the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet is one of the reasons why American Airlines trimmed its first quarter revenue forecast.  The grounding forced the airline to cancel hundreds of flights.  American says the key revenue metric will now be flat to up 1 percent.  Its prior forecast called for 2 percent growth.  Shares fell more than 1.5 percent to $33.31.</p><p>Levi Strauss reported a 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue and earnings of 37 cents per share.  The CEO described growth at the company as broad based.  Since this was the jeansmaker`s first report since going public, there were no estimates available.  The stock rose in initial after-hours trading after closing the regular session at $21.88.</p><p>There have been a lot of rumblings about regulating big tech companies.  Today, a Senate bill was introduced that takes aim at social media firms and it comes a year after a high-profile executive was called to Capitol Hill.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is back with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAUSCHE:  It`s been a year since Mark Zuckerberg embarked on his apology tour after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  We didn`t take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake, and it was my mistake and I`m sorry.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  A cascade of hearings since then.  Executives from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) testifying on everything from privacy to political bias, though progress on reining in social companies has been slow.  But today, Virginia Senator Mark Warner took another run at regulation running up a first in the series of bills to challenge business as usual.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  Mark Zuckerberg put in an editorial in a paper a week ago saying, calling for more regulation.  I think the platform companies will now have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is to see whether they support this legislation and other approaches.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  The bell would ban a practice called \"dark patterns\" where users are forced to share their data or opt into terms set by the company in order to use a product.  It would create a new regulator under the new Federal Trade Commission to be a cop on the beat.</p><p>A bipartisan group is working on a broader package of privacy safeguards.  Warner hopes his bill co-sponsored by Nebraska Republican Deb Fisher would get adopted by the group, whether it could pass large regulation into law by 2020 is uncertain.  But California`s effort is certain, new consumer processions set to become law next year.</p><p>JASON HELFSTEIN, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.:  If Congress doesn`t pass a national kind of privacy law, will go into effect January of next year and it`s quite onerous.  And I think you`re seeing can the companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) trying to get in front of it.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  That effort includes frequent face time in Washington with regulators, lawmakers and the president, and the record amount of spending on lobbying.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) spent $35 million in 2018, a roughly 15 percent increase from the prior year.  Twitter`s lobbying spent double.</p><p>That money is to influence bills that have not been written, but the biggest cost could come from investigations at the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and housing and urban development that could lobby massive fines on tech companies.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, we often talk about rising home prices, but in some markets rental costs are a real issue.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Home sales may be heating up this week, but renters aren`t getting a break.  In fact, rents have turned higher yet again and in some markets, affordability has become a significant challenge.</p><p>Diana Olick breaks down the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you`re looking to rent an apartment, it may take you a while to find one.  The vacancy rate at the end of last year fell to the lowest level since 1999.  This, even as more renters become buyers.</p><p>GREG WILLETT, REALPAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Resident retention when leases come up for renewal is at record level.  So while you might be losing more people to home purchase, they`re moving less frequently for job change or for change in household configuration.</p><p>OLICK:  Low vacancy means landlords can charge higher rents.  Rents backed off a little bit in 2017 and for much of last year as new apartments supply hit the market.  But rents are turning higher again now, and in some markets, the gains are causing real burdens for renters.  The worst, Miami, San Diego, L.A, New York and Orlando, according to a new survey from Freddie Mac.</p><p>In this markets, renters are paying well more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent, in some cases, even half their incomes.</p><p>San Francisco has the second highest rent in the country but is ranked 13th on the list of most rent burden.  That`s because salaries there are high.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely keep me from saving what I want to actually spend on.  So, I mean, pretty much having a roof over my head over going to try to save up for a nice car or a nice vacation is just kind of heartbreaking.</p><p>OLICK:  Even renters in luxury buildings won`t catch a break.  They have been seeing some good deals that so much new product was being completed in the last few years and landlords were offering incentive, but not so much now.</p><p>WILLETT:  You get that initial resident space built and when renewal leases come up, you can push the pricing a little bit.</p><p>OLICK:  Overall, rents are now rising at about the same pace as wage growth.  So, while too many Americans are still burdened by high rents, the bright side might be that unlike five years ago when rents were soaring, the situation this year may not get much better, but it won`t get worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The S&amp;P ends its string of gains thanks to fresh trade tensions and the possibility that they may never fully go away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Border bottleneck. The auto industry faces a new challenge and it`s coming from the dividing line between the U.S. and Mexico.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And rising rents. Why it`s not just home prices that are sky high in some markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, April 9th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Bill is off this evening.</p><p>There was a sense of nervousness on Wall Street today not only because earnings season is about to start, but also because of trade. That caused the S&amp;P 500 to halt an eight-day rally and push the treasury yields lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190 points to 26,150. The Nasdaq dropped 44 and the S&amp;P 500 gave back 17.</p><p>And today`s trade issue wasn`t about China. Instead, it was about the European Union.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s the latest salvo in the U.S.-Europe trade dispute, which had gone mostly quiet since the truce last August. But it`s ramping up again. The U.S. trade representative outlining $11 billion in European goods subject to new tariffs including aircraft, wine and 40 different types of cheese.</p><p>It`s retaliation for Europe`s subsidies on Boeing (NYSE:BA) competitor Airbus. President Trump tweeting that the E.U. has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years, it will soon stop. It`s not clear how high the tariffs would be or when they would go into effect. But three White House aides tell me the goal on trade policy is to pivot the negotiations with Europe which have stalled once China trade talks have concluded.</p><p>The Trump administration has a May 18th deadline to chart its next steps on auto tariffs which will largely impact Europe. Hence, why President Trump suggested a four-week time frame for China talks, said they would end before that date. China said it`s not committed to that timeline and Brussels called the new terror threat exaggerated. But President Trump has shown he`s not one to back down.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Much of the focus investors have been on trade relations with China and a hope for a deal between the world`s two largest economies.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that might not signal the end of the trade story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A lot of market commentary sees tariffs in the trade war as temporary events. A U.S.-China trade deal, the thinking goes, will sound the all-clear signal for markets and the economy, but their indications may be in for a longer, more protracted trade battle, a forever trade war that could last the balance of the Trump administration.</p><p>The chief economist of the IMF which downgraded global and U.S. growth today cited specific concerns for ongoing trade battles.</p><p>GITA GOPINATH, IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST: There has been improvement on the front between the U.S. and China, and a possible agreement in the near future. You know, we are worried about trade tensions escalating in other sectors like the auto sector, and that is particularly damaging given that it`s a highly integrated sector for the large global supply chains.</p><p>LIESMAN: Consider these developments. The tariffs remain in place for Mexico and Canada even after the U.S. struck a trade deal with the two countries. The U.S. wants to retain the right to put tariffs on China even after they signed a trade deal.</p><p>Finally, in just the past couple of days, the U.S. threatened the European Union with tariffs on aircrafts and autos could be next.</p><p>Art Hogan, chief market strategist with National Security, says if the administration decides to pivot immediately to tariffs on European autos, any positive momentum derived from an end to U.S.-China trade war will dissipate rapidly. It could be that tariffs are a negotiating tool and another explanation could be that the administration could keep tariffs in place for years in order to protect U.S. industries have permanently reduced imports. If the goal is bringing back manufacturing loss to China and other chief competitors, then temporary tariffs won`t do. If that`s the goal, markets should prepare for permanent trade barriers and possibly a forever trade war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The number of job openings fell to an 11-month low in February. According to the Labor Department, the measure dropped by 538,000 to 7.1 million. That`s the lowest level since March of last year. But the decline is off of near record levels and if you recall the government employment report that month showed a sharp dip, but only to bounce back in March.</p><p>Oil prices fell today, but that has not been the trend. Domestic crude is up about 40 percent this year. There have been recent rumblings about violence in Libya that have been impacted by sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.</p><p>So we brought in John Kilduff. He joins us now to talk more about what`s happening in the oil market and what it means to you. He is founding partner at Again Capital.</p><p>Welcome back, John.</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL: Good evening, Sue. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s start with Libya and the possible impact that it is having on oil prices right now.</p><p>KILDUFF: Right, it`s sort of the icing on a bad cake for consumers at this point.</p><p>HERERA: Right.</p><p>KILDUFF: Basically, we`ve had warring factions in Libya for a year since Moammar Gadhafi, the former dictator, was overthrown and ultimately killed. There is a consolidation now of power going on. There is a general by the name of Haftar that has marshaled his resources. He already controls the eastern part of Libya and the oil is falling there. He is now making a move to consolidate the rest of the country and the battle for Tripoli, the capital is on so to speak.</p><p>I`m getting the sense that he`ll prevail and that the situation will revert to the way it was when Moammar Gadhafi was there, a sort of heavy handed force on an otherwise tribally organized country.</p><p>HERERA: Right.</p><p>KILDUFF: Which is good news for consumers because the oil will flow.</p><p>HERERA: The oil will flow. It is not flowing for other parts of the country, of the world, rather and the whole situation is really exacerbated by the fact that we`ve had some refining issues here at home, correct? I mean, we`ve had bad weather in certain places and catastrophes in others.</p><p>KILDUFF: Right, and sort of the one-two punch is this. You have Venezuela imploding because of what`s happening in that country and its involvement into just zero oil production at some point here. Also, too, you have a very committed Saudi Arabia that`s working hard to reduce global supplies and they`ve undercut their quota by quite a bit. So, that has tightened the market.</p><p>So, now, you add Venezuela getting worse and worse and you add the Iran sanctions and now you add problems with the U.S. refiners and it sort of gets the cauldron boiled up from time to time.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, we`ve had major fires at U.S. refineries and we`ve had the Mideast flooding. All of this for consumers means higher prices, right?</p><p>KILDUFF: Right. In the Midwest, flooding is a weird one off, too, because what happened there is the ethanol supply which is blended off the coast particularly in California and in New York and East Coast is stranded there. And the East Coast are scrambling to buy it from Brazil, the West Coast they`ve not had a lot of options, there`s actually been spot shortages.</p><p>So, yes, again, this is something that should pass. I would point out that the fact that the U.S. is now the world`s number one oil producer at over 12 million barrels, it does cover a multitude of sins. We would be talking about a very horrific price environment, Sue, if it`s just a couple of years ago --</p><p>HERERA: Absolutely.</p><p>KILDUFF: -- when we were nowhere near those levels.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that optimistic note, John Kilduff --</p><p>KILDUFF: Hang in there, folks. It will be OK.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly. Thanks, John.</p><p>HERERA: Well, there`s a new threat for the auto industry involving parts and vehicles built in Mexico. Slowdowns and delays are developing at the border due to the shift on how border patrol agents are being used.</p><p>And as Phil LeBeau reports, that is creating bottlenecks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The U.S.-Mexico border. Every day, thousands of auto parts and automobiles go back and forth before they eventually wind up in showrooms here in the U.S.</p><p>But in the last week, the president`s push to tighten border security has created serious delays which could wind up slowing down auto plants.</p><p>KRISTIN DZICKZEK, CENTER FOR AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH: Automakers know what they get from Mexico and they know what they`re not going to get when there is some shipments that are getting through and some aren`t and there are seven-hour delays, and, you know, you`re going to send home half a shift, you`re not going to have, you know, not very smooth production until the whole production system can adjust this.</p><p>LEBEAU: Last year, more than half of the trucks and cars sold in the U.S. were built in the U.S., with another 15 percent from Mexico, easily outpacing imports from other countries. It`s where many Chevy Silverado, Ram pickups and other popular models are built. So far, the supply of new vehicles coming out of Mexico has not been hurt, but if the delays continue and the flow of components or parts slows down, so will assembly lines both in Mexico and the U.S.</p><p>DZICKZEK: It only takes one missing part to suspend production here in the U.S. and on the other side in Mexico, and the cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico is really quite intense.</p><p>LEBEAU: It is not uncommon for auto parts to go between the U.S. and Mexico two to three times before they ultimately wind up in a finished vehicle, which is why the auto industry is closely following the tension at the border.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: On Capitol Hill, executives from some of the nation`s largest pharmacy benefit managers testified on the rising price of prescription drugs, and they were on the defensive saying they are not to blame.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Senate Finance Committee heads Chuck Grassley and Ron Wyden say they want to get to the bottom of whether pharmacy benefit contracts put industry profits ahead of consumer prices.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): More transparency is needed. The current system is so opaque that it`s easy to see why there are questions about PBMs motives.</p><p>COOMBS: PBMs are the middle men who negotiate discounts with drugmakers on prescription drugs for insurance companies and big employers. Now, drugmakers and others say that those discounts negotiated through secret contracts lead to higher list prices and consumer costs.</p><p>SEN. RON WYDEN (D), OREGON: I`m of the view that pharmaceutical benefit managers guard their operations with greater secrecy than HBO is guarding the ending of \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>COOMBS: PBM executives say they support transparency to a point.</p><p>JOHN PRINCE, OPTUMRX CEO: We have transparency to who hires us. We also are transparent to the government in terms of disposing it to CMS in terms of rebates. But if you disclose that to the external market, it would hurt our ability to get a good value for people we negotiate for.</p><p>COOMBS: Cigna`s Steve Miller defended PBM contracting, noting tough negotiations help produce big savings when expensive hepatitis C drug hit the market.</p><p>STEVEN MILLER, MD, CIGNA (NYSE:CI) CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER: In the first year, we treated 60,000 patients to cure to achieve higher adherence than the drug`s clinical trial and save patients and health systems over $1 billion.</p><p>COOMBS: Asked about proposals to cut out the middlemen and the government pricing new drugs, the executives warned it wouldn`t keep drugmakers from raising prices.</p><p>WILLIAM FLEMING, HUMANA HEALTHCARE SERVICES PRESIDENT: My concern from government to get the negotiation would be higher list prices initially when they come out to offset what the manufacturer would have to give up.</p><p>COOMBS: The pharmacy benefit firms will be back on Capitol Hill tomorrow, this time along with drugmakers for a hearing in the House, Energy and Commerce Committee that`s focusing on insulin prices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: There was a separate hearing in the news that Wall Street was watching.</p><p>Attorney General Barr testified before the House Appropriations Committee. He gave lawmakers a timeframe for when the Justice Department will release a redacted copy of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HON. WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with the chairman of both judiciary committees about that report and about any further requests that they have.</p><p>(END VIIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The hearing was intended to focus on the 2020 fiscal budget.</p><p>It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades. Disney (NYSE:DIS) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Cowen. The analyst cites Disney`s product pipeline and says Thursday`s investor day will likely be a debt clearing event for sentiment. The price target is $131. The stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $116.86.</p><p>U.S. Steel was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse. The analyst says U.S. Steel is in a weaker competitive position compared to its peers. The price target is $13. The stock fell about 10 percent to $17.77.</p><p>Still ahead, think the retail industry is changing? Well, a new report says just you wait.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is hiking its minimum wage to $20 an hour. The CEO says the increase will be implemented over the next two years. Paychecks will go to $17 at first and then $20 which is the highest minimum wage paid by any of the country`s biggest banks. The announcement comes one day before bank`s CEOs are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Optimism on Main Street ticked higher last month. According to the National Federation of independent business, business owners are more optimistic about economic growth and do not expect a recession any time soon. The survey also points to solid investment spending and hiring.</p><p>Well, the retail industry could use some of that optimism as store closings are projected to accelerate. According to UBS, nearly 75,000 retail stores will close if online sales reached 25 percent in total retail sales by 2026.</p><p>Michael Lasser joins us. He`s with UBS to discuss his outlook. He wrote that report.</p><p>Michael, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>MICHAEL LASSER, UBS RETAIL ANALYST: Thanks for having me, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Very quickly, how did you come up with that metric and those numbers?</p><p>LASSER: The way we came up with those metric -- measures is looking at a variety of data from various sources and came up within the sources to determine what`s the equilibrium between the supply of available places to buy goods and the demand to buy goods through physical places. And what we`re seeing is there are just too many stores in the U.S. and as a result we`re going to see more store closures over time, particularly as e- commerce growth continues to increase.</p><p>HERERA: You broke it out into different subsectors. Which subsectors need to close the most stores?</p><p>LASSER: The way we see it, the subsector that need to close the most stores include those consumer electronics, home furnishings, the apparel sector. These are areas where we`re seeing continued increases in the rate of online penetration and as a result we suffer from too much capacity in terms of the number of stores that are serving those industries. As a result they`re the ones that will be at the forefront of store closures over the next several years.</p><p>HERERA: And how many of these are within enclosed malls versus how many are freestanding?</p><p>LASSER: It`s a good question, Sue. Right now, there are about 100 in enclosed malls in the U.S. A good portion of those enclosed malls include apparel retailers. And so, that`s going to be the heart of the consolidation in that sector, and we`re going continue to see more and more closures in that area and otherwise we`ll see home furnishings and retailers and clothes within malls and we`re seeing that right now. We`re going to see a shift from the mall-based retailers to off-mall as a result of the convenience of off-mall shopping.</p><p>HERERA: Now, there are some sectors in retail that you do like. So from an investment perspective for those who have a longer term time horizon, you like hard lines, things like Home Depots and Lowe`s and the like, correct?</p><p>LASSER: That`s correct, Sue. We like those sectors because there is an element to the sale where the consumer still really values going to the store. In the case of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe`s, even when doing online sales, about half of those are picked up in the store.</p><p>The same is true in the auto part space for companies like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and O`Reilly and Advance Auto. So having that Omni-channel presence is very important and you`re seeing less disruption from the online channel.</p><p>HERERA: Michael Lasser with UBS -- Michael, thank you.</p><p>LASSER: Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: From the retail sector to the investment that`s historically been popular in retail investors, muni bonds. And believe it or not, this plain vanilla part of the market is garnering a lot more attention following the passage of the new tax law.</p><p>Robert Frank explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: One of the least glamorous segments of the investing world is suddenly a huge hit with wealthy investors. Municipal bonds or muni bonds have soared in popularity in recent months as investors look to offset a big tax bill. Investor flows into muni bonds so far this year have topped $20 billion, that`s it is highest in 13 years.</p><p>The main reason: tax-free income. Investors who live in high-tech states like New York, New Jersey or California are writing bigger checks to the government this month because of that new cap on state and local tax deductions. To create more tax-free income, those high earners are putting more money into muni bonds which are exempt from federal income and often state and local income taxes. So, if you have a 10-year muni bond that yields 2 percent, its taxable equipment could be 4 percent or higher.</p><p>All that demand has driven down yields in the $3.8 trillion market to the lowest levels against Treasury since 2001, and that has been good for the state especially high-tax states that have been fighting the new tax law. Eight of the ten biggest issuers in the first quarter were in California, New York and Connecticut. New Jersey and Illinois were also big issuers. So the tax law has lowered the borrowing cost for the state most opposed to the new tax code.</p><p>California last month issued a $3.3 billion bond deal that had an interest rate of about a third of a percentage point below 2017. While that doesn`t sound like much, it saves the state about $8 million. Politicians in those high-tech states saying the gains from the muni bond boom can`t nearly offset the billions that their taxpayers are leaving to Washington.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY: I think obviously good resource investment into states is a good thing and to help infrastructure. But this is certainly not a long-term solution.</p><p>FRANK: The big question for investors is whether the muni mania has gone too far and created a new asset bubble. For example, yields on munis for Illinois, the lowest rated state in the country, are now below 3.6 percent. That`s only about a point higher than the U.S. 10-year treasury.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Boeing`s report has declined in deliveries and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Total deliveries were nearly halved in the first quarter following the grounding of Boeing`s popular 737 MAX jet. Net orders fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier. There were no new 737 MAX orders during the month of March. Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell about 1.5 percent to $369.04.</p><p>And the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet is one of the reasons why American Airlines trimmed its first quarter revenue forecast. The grounding forced the airline to cancel hundreds of flights. American says the key revenue metric will now be flat to up 1 percent. Its prior forecast called for 2 percent growth. Shares fell more than 1.5 percent to $33.31.</p><p>Levi Strauss reported a 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue and earnings of 37 cents per share. The CEO described growth at the company as broad based. Since this was the jeansmaker`s first report since going public, there were no estimates available. The stock rose in initial after-hours trading after closing the regular session at $21.88.</p><p>There have been a lot of rumblings about regulating big tech companies. Today, a Senate bill was introduced that takes aim at social media firms and it comes a year after a high-profile executive was called to Capitol Hill.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is back with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAUSCHE: It`s been a year since Mark Zuckerberg embarked on his apology tour after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: We didn`t take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake, and it was my mistake and I`m sorry.</p><p>TAUSCHE: A cascade of hearings since then. Executives from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) testifying on everything from privacy to political bias, though progress on reining in social companies has been slow. But today, Virginia Senator Mark Warner took another run at regulation running up a first in the series of bills to challenge business as usual.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA: Mark Zuckerberg put in an editorial in a paper a week ago saying, calling for more regulation. I think the platform companies will now have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is to see whether they support this legislation and other approaches.</p><p>TAUSCHE: The bell would ban a practice called \"dark patterns\" where users are forced to share their data or opt into terms set by the company in order to use a product. It would create a new regulator under the new Federal Trade Commission to be a cop on the beat.</p><p>A bipartisan group is working on a broader package of privacy safeguards. Warner hopes his bill co-sponsored by Nebraska Republican Deb Fisher would get adopted by the group, whether it could pass large regulation into law by 2020 is uncertain. But California`s effort is certain, new consumer processions set to become law next year.</p><p>JASON HELFSTEIN, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: If Congress doesn`t pass a national kind of privacy law, will go into effect January of next year and it`s quite onerous. And I think you`re seeing can the companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) trying to get in front of it.</p><p>TAUSCHE: That effort includes frequent face time in Washington with regulators, lawmakers and the president, and the record amount of spending on lobbying. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) spent $35 million in 2018, a roughly 15 percent increase from the prior year. Twitter`s lobbying spent double.</p><p>That money is to influence bills that have not been written, but the biggest cost could come from investigations at the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and housing and urban development that could lobby massive fines on tech companies.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, we often talk about rising home prices, but in some markets rental costs are a real issue.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Home sales may be heating up this week, but renters aren`t getting a break. In fact, rents have turned higher yet again and in some markets, affordability has become a significant challenge.</p><p>Diana Olick breaks down the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you`re looking to rent an apartment, it may take you a while to find one. The vacancy rate at the end of last year fell to the lowest level since 1999. This, even as more renters become buyers.</p><p>GREG WILLETT, REALPAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST: Resident retention when leases come up for renewal is at record level. So while you might be losing more people to home purchase, they`re moving less frequently for job change or for change in household configuration.</p><p>OLICK: Low vacancy means landlords can charge higher rents. Rents backed off a little bit in 2017 and for much of last year as new apartments supply hit the market. But rents are turning higher again now, and in some markets, the gains are causing real burdens for renters. The worst, Miami, San Diego, L.A, New York and Orlando, according to a new survey from Freddie Mac.</p><p>In this markets, renters are paying well more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent, in some cases, even half their incomes.</p><p>San Francisco has the second highest rent in the country but is ranked 13th on the list of most rent burden. That`s because salaries there are high.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely keep me from saving what I want to actually spend on. So, I mean, pretty much having a roof over my head over going to try to save up for a nice car or a nice vacation is just kind of heartbreaking.</p><p>OLICK: Even renters in luxury buildings won`t catch a break. They have been seeing some good deals that so much new product was being completed in the last few years and landlords were offering incentive, but not so much now.</p><p>WILLETT: You get that initial resident space built and when renewal leases come up, you can push the pricing a little bit.</p><p>OLICK: Overall, rents are now rising at about the same pace as wage growth. So, while too many Americans are still burdened by high rents, the bright side might be that unlike five years ago when rents were soaring, the situation this year may not get much better, but it won`t get worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The European Union just gave Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) a headache, a big one. And some say it could force the tech giant to change the way it does business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Monetary man, interrupted. Something happened today that likely never happened before at the staid and serious meeting of European Central Bankers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: Orange is the new green. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports a big earnings miss. Investors don`t care and send shares soaring after the results.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, Tax Day, April 15th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>It is become called the defining case for the Internet Age. Today, the European Union formally accused Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for abusing its dominance in web searches, filing antitrust charges against the company. The agency said Google`s methods cheat both consumers and competitors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Our preliminary view in the segment of objection is that in its general Internet search result, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) artificially favors its own comparison shopping service and that this constitutes an abuse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: That case could cost the tech firm billions in fines, maybe even force Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to make changes to its business model, and it is drawing comparisons to the antitrust case against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that dragged on for years.</p><p>Despite that news, though, shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Class A shares rose slightly today.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more on what the charges means for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), a stock wildly held in mutual funds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The European Commission delivered a blow to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) this morning, not only filing antitrust charges against the tech giant but also announcing a formal investigation into Android, Google`s mobile operating system.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) quickly shot back.</p><p>ADAM COHEN, GOOGLE: But look at the tremendous innovations and evolution that we`ve seen in the search industry over the past few years. We can`t standstill. We face enormous competitive pressure and we`re going to respond to that in the marketplace. Separately, we`re going to have a discussion with the regulators about how we do that.</p><p>LIPTON: This news comes at a tough time for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Its stock has gone nowhere over the last 12 months as investors worry that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has missed the boat in social media and ad dollars are moving to companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Worst case scenario, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) could face a potential $6 billion fine. The company does boast a cash pile of some $60 billion so that fine though serious wouldn`t be a huge setback.</p><p>More broadly regulators could force Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to make changes to its search business. That could have a chilling effect on Google`s ability to remain innovative.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) became the dominant search engine around the world by writing algorithms than were better than anybody else`s. Will the company still be able to innovate?</p><p>And then there`s the potential stock impact. When Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) faced antitrust charges in Europe several years ago, its stock underperformed the market. For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), the stock impact may be more muted.</p><p>MARK MAHANEY, RBC ANALYST: The irony is this overhang comes in when the stock has already become relatively mature. So, this doesn`t have a dramatic impact on the valuation. If this happened five years ago, it would have.</p><p>LIPTON: A final E.U. decision could come by the end of the year. However, corporate governance experts say Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) should resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Otherwise, they say such charges can have an impact on recruitment, employee morale and brand reputation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Victor Anthony now joins us to tell us what he thinks of what he thinks all this will mean for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock and the investors who own it. He`s senior Internet analyst with Axiom Capital Management.</p><p>Victor, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>VICTOR ANTHONY, AXIOM: Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: You hear some of the thing that Josh Lipton just said. What is the risk here? What is the potential cost here for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of fines? Josh had one number. In terms of business model risk and in terms of risk to profitability.</p><p>ANTHONY: Listen, I think Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the world`s (INAUDIBLE) organization and the stock trades in a reasonable multiple to earnings growth, as well as to the S&amp;P500. But as to the E.U. investigation, it`s one of multiple different overhangs that the stock faces this year, I will keep range bound.</p><p>But specifically on the E.U., you know, I`ve heard $6 billion number, maybe goes to $10 billion, you know, the company has about -- they should end the quarter, the first quarter, with about $67 billion, $68 billion in cash on the balance sheet to generate anywhere between $12 billion and $15 billion in free cash at least this year.</p><p>So, it would be somewhat of a small hit to the balance sheet, I think, roughly, $9 per share. So, which I think is probably impacted (ph) to the value of the stock. But I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTHONY: I`m sorry, go ahead.</p><p>HERERA: Finish your thought.</p><p>ANTHONY: The real issue, my real concern is really the business practice changes. If that occurs, I think you could see some meaningful risk to Google`s earnings trajectory over the next several years.</p><p>HERERA: So, are comparisons to the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) scenario that occurred a few years ago with the E.U., are those fair comparisons or not?</p><p>ANTHONY: It`s somewhat fair. It`s somewhat fair, I think.</p><p>But in combination of all the different risks that the company faces, you know, competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter, there`s concerns about slowing search growth, there`s investments that are pressuring the margins. You look at the -- they may potentially lose Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a search partner in the next two months.</p><p>So, you know, those are things I think all put together is probably going to keep the shares range bound this year. If you own it, you hold it. If you don`t own it, I don`t see any reason to really get into the stock right now. If you own it, you can take some profits. Reallocate your -- some of those profits into some --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATHISEN: You have a hold rating on the stock. Your price target is what?</p><p>ANTHONY: $608.</p><p>MATHISEN: $608. So, basically, you think it`s not going to move very much.</p><p>Very quickly, what would Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) need to do to get to you switch from a hold to a buy?</p><p>ANTHONY: Well, I think they need to, you know, kind of work their way through the E.U. antitrust investigation. They need to convince us that, you know, search business is still holding up. And maybe an acquisition of a social media platform, maybe Twitter.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very interesting. Victor, thank you very much. You left on a high note there, Victor. Thank you very much.</p><p>Victor Anthony with Axiom Capital Management.</p><p>Intriguing.</p><p>ANTHONY: Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: Well, it`s not every day you see one of the most powerful men in the world get glitter bombed while speaking about economic stimulus policies but that`s exactly what happened today in Frankfurt when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi took to the podium.</p><p>Annette Weisbach was there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNETTE WEISBACH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: That was most likely the most eventful press conference of Mario Draghi. Just minutes into him reading the introductory statement, an activist from a feminist group allegedly came in, just got up and started to throw paper and confetti over him. Of course, she had to be escorted outside of the building.</p><p>But the question mark, of course, is around the fact, how could she actually enter the building? And the answer most likely lies in the fact that it`s very easy to get a press card in Eurozone, in Germany. With a press card, you can have access to the <person><nameText>ECB.</nameText></person></p><p>But switching to monetary policy now, Mario Draghi has not said anything very new. He`s quite optimistic about the outlook for the economy, but saying that is depending on the <person><nameText>ECB </nameText></person>implementing quantitative easing and to at least September 2016. Only if inflation were to pick up a lot faster than expected, then <person><nameText>ECB </nameText></person>could stop the program earlier than September 2016.</p><p>Also, he rebuffed criticism that perhaps there`s not enough bonds out there for them to buy because a lot of bonds here in the eurozone trading with negative yields and the <person><nameText>ECB </nameText></person>has said earlier they are not going to buy anything with negative yields, lower than the deposit rate, which currently is at minus 20 basis points.</p><p>But for now, things look pretty much relaxed. Next time, we get the new stock projections from the <person><nameText>ECB. </nameText></person>That would be interesting, because then we also get an understanding how really optimistic they are of the future here. And the Eurozone looking baffled at the lower euro rate exchange which is, of course, helping the eurozone.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Annette Weisbach in Frankfurt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And now to China where the world`s second largest economy grew at the slowest pace in six years.</p><p>And as Eunice Yoon reports from Beijing, investors are now looking to see whether the government will take any additional steps to pump up growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: China`s GDP came in at 7 percent for the first quarter. This is largely in line with expectations, but it`s also the slowest level of growth this country has seen since the depths of the financial crisis.</p><p>Now, the focus was on the March data. Instead of the pick up that everybody was expecting, we saw a tapering and that suggested to many people here that the economy is decelerating and headed for even slower growth.</p><p>Now, the data also raised expectations among economists here that policymakers are going to have to step in and take some action. Some combination of interest rate cuts or cuts to the Triple-R which is the amount of cash that banks have to have on hand in reserve.</p><p>The authorities, though, don`t seem to be hitting the panic button just yet. In the run up to the release of the data, the Chinese premier actually came on state radio and spoke to the public directly to say that there`s a downward pressure on the economy, but that everyone needs to adjust to this and that the country needs to prepare for even further economic challenges.</p><p>The employment number came out at 5.1 percent. And the interesting thing was a commentary around it, because officials said that the jobs market here is stable. But time and again, the government has said that the employment is really going to determine just how aggressive the government is in trying to prop up growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: To Wall Street now where stocks rose on speculation first quarter earnings may not be as weak as previously thought. The small cap Russell 2000 index closed within a record. At the major averages within 1 percent of their all-time highs. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrials Average rose nearly 76 points to 18,112. The NASDAQ gained almost 34, and the S&amp;P 500 11.</p><p>But it was the price of oil that really jumped, up nearly 6 percent, closing at $56.39. It`s high for the year.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more now on the recent rise in prices and where they may be heading.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Two reasons crude oil prices went higher, the first would be the EIA inventory report from last week, a build of 1.3 billion barrels, much smaller than traders were expecting, much smaller that we`ve seen in the last few weeks and also months.</p><p>But also, geopolitical tensions still on the radar, making traders nervous. They are watching the situation in Yemen very closely.</p><p>Now, these fundamentals right now still say that supply/demand situation is working itself out, but it`s going to take more time to rebalance. That would imply that we should see a lower crude price for the market, the technical obviously thinking otherwise. I do want to point out it was near a 6 percent move today but we`ve seen some very volatile swings this year. Move (NASDAQ:MOVE) of 4 percent to the upside or the downside 22 times this year.</p><p>So, traders are saying we could see more volatility ahead. This doesn`t necessarily indicate the next direction for the market.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Though oil prices are rising now, they were low for quite a while and that has hurt parts of the U.S. economy. According to the Federal Reserve`s Beige Book, the drop in prices forced energy companies and some manufacturers to increase their layoffs. The survey also says the rising dollar is having an adverse effect on some industries. But that the U.S. economy overall continues to grow albeit at a moderate pace.</p><p>HERERA : And today in an interview on CNBC, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said that despite some of the recent weakness in economic data, the U.S. is in good shape, especially when compared to other economies around the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK LEW, TREASURY SECRETARY: I talk to business people around the world and my colleagues, my counterparts around the world. I don`t hear a lot of questions about whether or not the United States is strong and continuing to be headed in the right direct. There are a lot of concern about the global economy, and the disparate performance between the U.S. economy and other parts of the global economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The secretary also said confidence is up, consumers have more cash in their pockets, and that he`s not concerned about the strengthening dollar.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, another challenge that does face the U.S. economy is income disparity and today, on Tax Day, fast food workers across the country and across the world took to the streets to demand higher wages.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): In Brooklyn, New York, demonstrators blocked traffic this morning, and on Manhattan`s Upper West Side, they staged a die in.</p><p>KARL KUMOZEI, DEMONSTRATOR: I would say if you`re keeping your workers on poverty wages, you`re literally tearing people.</p><p>BETH SCHAFFER, DEMONSTRATOR: If it wasn`t for me you wouldn`t have your subsidy.</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>MATHISEN: Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles were among the 200-plus cities where workers made their presence felt today. But consumers could see higher prices if the going wage hits $15 an hour.</p><p>ROBERT DERRINGTON, WUNDERLICH: These companies have to figure out how can they ultimately both cover that cost, either through higher menu prices or through their menu mix and at the same time try to manage the workforce so that they don`t lose workers to someone else and they keep them staffed. It`s a very tough proposition for restaurant companies.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Twenty-three states in all will raise their minimum wages this year but none of the state minimums are scheduled to rise above $10 an hour.</p><p>HERERA: Meantime, one Seattle company is really redefining the term minimum wage.</p><p>Dan Price, the CEO of the credit card payments firm Gravity (NASDAQ:GRVY) has decided to close the pay gap in a big way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN PRICE, CEO, GRAVITY: We have a really exciting situation here. We`re going to have a minimum $70,000 pay rate for everyone that works here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: All of his 120 employees will now make at least $70,000 a year.</p><p>The changes will be made over the next three years and Price will take a pay cut. His salary of $1 million will be $70,000 a year. The changes will reportedly use 80 percent of anticipated profits for the year. But Price believes the move isn`t just the right thing to do. It`s good business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRICE: With leadership includes doing what`s right, even when there`s not a direct kind of one for one carrot or stick. In the end, when you run your business that way for the future, you`re going to create more value in the long term for everybody not just those folks that got the bump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Before the increase, the company`s average salary was about $50,000 a year.</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, another company that made social responsibility its mission is about to go public but will investors embrace the strategy?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The streaming video companyNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) out with its quarterly results late today it earned 38 cents a share and that was a big miss -- 31 cents below estimates, revenue of $1.5 billion was in line with estimates, but a big increase from a year ago. That sent shares up as much as 12 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has one the key takeaway from that report and the reason why investors are blowing off that big earnings miss.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Investors shrugged off a earnings miss, thanks to a strong dollar, and focus on Netflix`s far better than expected subscriber edition. The company added 4.9 million new streaming subscribers, more than half of those from overseas, as the company continues its global rollout.</p><p>Domestic subscribers also grew faster than expected, as original contents like \"House of Cards\" helped to add and retain customers. The company also forecasting the addition of more new subscribers in the second quarter than Wall Street analysts projected.</p><p>Reed Hastings writing his letter to shareholders, quote, \"Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving loss of viewing an economic way for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), while bolstering the positive perception of our brand. With the stock shooting up to a new all time high on the upside surprise, it seems to be boosting positive perception of the stock as well.</p><p>Back over to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: That was Julia Boorstin. And Julia will be back shortly with just -- with a story on Etsy, the online marketplace for craft, that`s getting ready to go public.</p><p>HERERA: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the country`s second biggest bank, swings to a profit and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The results show BofA is starting to recover from its large legal losses of prior years. Still, its earnings and revenue missed analyst estimates and the bank`s trading performance fell short of its rival JP Morgan. Shares fell 1 percent to $15.64.</p><p>US Bancorp saw its profit edge up by more than 2 percent, as its revenue and loans increased. But overall revenue trailed consensus and its net interest margin, which is an important measure of lending profitability fell. Shares were off a few cents to $43.42.</p><p>Charles Schwab`s quarterlies missed on both the top and bottom lines. Profit fell because the company was hurt by higher one-time costs and a slowdown in trading. Still, shares were up slightly to $30.53.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Sue, Delta`s earnings beat the street, while revenue came in right at the expectation point. The company said this March quarter was its best in history. But, the carrier is cutting some international flights because of the strong dollar and falling oil prices. Shares were 2.5 percent higher to $44.20.</p><p>HCA Holdings upped its full-year guidance on better-than-expected preliminary earnings. The hospital operator said higher admissions and emergency room visits will help revenue results for the quarter and the full year. Shares popped 2.5 percent to $79.24, the close there.</p><p>Target (NYSE:TGT) is close to a settlement with MasterCard (NYSE:MA) over its 2013 data breach, this according to \"The Wall Street Journal\". The settlement would see the retailer reimburse financial institutions about $20 million in costs related to having to reissue credit cards. Target (NYSE:TGT) is in the middle of a separate negotiation with Visa (NYSE:V).</p><p>Shares of Target (NYSE:TGT) fell more than 1 percent to $81.96. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) up a bit, it closed at $89.25.</p><p>HERERA: You might have noticed the IPO market has cooled down this year as the number of companies going public slowed dramatically. But this week, that`s changing.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s been a lousy year for IPOs but that may be about to change. The collapse of the energy business was a big problem but there were also very few big tech deals as well.</p><p>First, biotech firm Aduro Biotech priced at $17 and more than doubled its value on its first day of trading. They specialize in cancer immuno therapy that leverages the patient`s immune system to slow the growth and the spread of tumor sales.</p><p>Three big names are pricing tonight, and while they`re all in different spaces, they have all similar characteristics -- strong cash flow and a leadership position in the markets.</p><p>First is Etsy. That`s an online marketplace for handmade goods. It`s still losing money but it has a very loyal following, largely but not exclusively among women.</p><p>Then, there`s Virtu Financial. It`s a global market maker, in 10,000 securities in 30 countries. They make money primarily by capturing small spread between the prices of stocks.</p><p>Finally, there`s my favorite, Party City. Who-ho! It`s pretty serious business. They are the leading party goods retailer in North America. They have 880 stores.</p><p>Now, they just sell in their stores. They make something like 70 percent of the products in their stores, they are also a big distributor of party goods to independent stores and to mass merchants. So, either way you`re likely buying your party goods from them.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: As Bob just mentioned, Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods, one of the big IPOs this week, is scheduled to start trading tomorrow after pricing its IPO tonight at the high end of the range. But this company is different. Etsy is a certificated socially responsible corporation.</p><p>So, will investors embrace a firm that cares more than just the bottom line?</p><p>Julia Boorstin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN (voice-over): Etsy isn`t another ecommerce Web site. The 10-year-old Brooklyn-based company says it wants to re-imagine commerce. Its marketplace gives 1.4 million sellers a platform and tools to connect with nearly 20 million buyers, selling products as eclectic as a tuxedo capped scarf, a handmade felt box and a Cinderella dress.</p><p>The company charges 20 cents to list a single item for four months. If it sells, the company takes a 3.5 percent cut. Etsy also charges for prominent placement and search results for payment processing and shipping labels.</p><p>BRIAN HAMILTON, SAGEWORKS: These guys are basically focused on a niche that is growing very nicely. It should be a little bit expandable. I think the reason their valuation is not quite as high is some of the other IPOs that have come out is because it is a smaller company. But I like the potential growth of the company.</p><p>BOORSTIN (on camera): Etsy is the biggest ever IPO of a B corporation. It`s a certification for companies that meet certain social and environmental standards, like lead certification for green buildings. Etsy says its social mission is to change the way the global economy works by empowering entrepreneurs.</p><p>(voice-over): The company also compost food waste at local community farms, offer employees used bikes and maintenance and uses reclaimed office furniture. And it`s expanding its community oriented approach to its public offering, setting aside of 5 percent pre-IPO shares for its vendors, plus another 10 percent to shares marketed to other small investors.</p><p>HAMILTON: I have no problem with a company that has sort of a social mission as long as while they are being social, they are generating cash flow which this company is.</p><p>BOORSTIN: The question is whether investors will think that being a good business is good for business. Last year, Etsy grew it`s revenue 56 percent to $196 million, but its net loss widened to more than $15 million from a loss of $800,000 the prior year, as the company invests in marketing.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Why farmers are quickly becoming the symbol of California`s water crisis. The battle against the drought rages on when we come back.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here`s what to watch tomorrow: a fresh read on the labor market with initial jobless claims. We will find out tomorrow on the state of housing when housing starts are released and more earnings, Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP) and more. That`s what`s on the agenda for Thursday.</p><p>HERERA: The battle lines in California are being drawn. The historic water restrictions imposed by the state`s governor earlier this month are pitting farmers against just about everybody else. And the fight is heating up.</p><p>Jane Wells has more from Huron, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): California has the most people and it has the biggest farm economy. Now, the epic drought has pitted city versus country. It`s getting nutty.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your numbers are a little off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, they`re not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re not going to pull that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nope, nope.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nope!</p><p>WELLS: That`s a local talk radio host in Los Angeles arguing on air with a nut ranch manager.</p><p>Governor Jerry Brown has ordered residents and businesses to cutback 25 percent without demanding the same cuts from farmers, even though farms use at least four times as much water.</p><p>JOHN KOBYLT, RADIO HOST: They are growing almonds which takes about 10 percent of the water supply in a desert climate. How nuts is that?</p><p>MARK BORBA, FARMER: Everybody could live with fewer of every crop I`m sure. But almonds are in such demand not only in the U.S. but around the world.</p><p>WELLS: Mark Borba grows almonds in the Central Valley, and $6 billion almond industry has been particularly targeted with figures like one gallon of water needed for every nut. He and other farmers say they`ve already been cutting back on water for years.</p><p>BORBA: We`re getting zero surface water allocation from our contracts.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): Part of the problem is California`s regulations about water and water rights, which in some cases more back a century. And water is now so tight, some farmers are turning against other farmers as the \"A.P.\" reports some water has gone missing. And for all the water that goes to farms, even more goes to the environment.</p><p>CRAIG UNDERWOOD, FARMER: I don`t hear criticism of the water that`s being released to bring back fish which is a good goal but is it being effective.</p><p>WELLS (voice-over): It`s going be a long hot dry summer in California as the age old battle for water gushes anew.</p><p>KOBYLT: We can do without the almonds. I can`t do without a glass of water. So, we win, they lose.</p><p>WELLS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, in California Central Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: That`s a big fight.</p><p>All right. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening, everybody. And we will see you back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The major automakers are embracing electric vehicles and making green more affordable for drivers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sweet idea? Can a company known for its gold box of chocolates find growth by expanding into an ultra competitive industry?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, April 17th.</p><p>And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome. Sue is off tonight.</p><p>Don`t look now, but big tech is making a very big comeback. That sector has been powering higher the past few months, and today, the Nasdaq 100 closed at a record high. That index is a basket of 100 largest and most actively traded companies on the Nasdaq, which is made up mostly of technology stocks. It`s a remarkable turnaround for a group that was beaten down just a few months ago.</p><p>Bertha Coombs starts us off tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Nasdaq 100`s gains today were driven by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and chip technology firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) after the tech giants announced that they had settled their longstanding patent dispute. Large cap tech names dominate on the Nasdaq 100 and it has been their strong recovery in 2019 that has pushed the index to a new record high after what was a brutal year end of 2018.</p><p>The semiconductor sector is a prime example. Semis fell 18 percent in the fourth quarter and concerns the U.S.-China trade war would make it difficult for manufacturers to import chips to the U.S. The trade headlines have improved. Chipmakers have seen a strong recovery with new highs today for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), and a new record for the sector.</p><p>The biggest contributors to the Nasdaq 100`s gains year to date have been four of the tech heavyweights that suffered big losses in December. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is now up 36 percent. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) up 28 percent and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) up 24 percent and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) up 20.</p><p>But the next big catalyst for this group is going to be earnings, with all four scheduled to in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs at the Nasdaq.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Timothy Lesko joins us now to talk more about technology and what`s driving it. He`s principal at Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>Tim, always good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PRINCIPAL: Thanks for having me, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, just a few months ago, and as Bertha was pointing out, down so sharply and now we`re back. But does that mean the problems that were plaguing the group, the problems with semiconductors, the slowdown in sales for smartphones, the trade concerns, are those gone now?</p><p>LESKO: I wouldn`t say that all of the concerns are gone, but a few have been taken off the table, particularly investors see that the Chinese trade negotiations seem to be going well or better than anybody expected and on top of that a few of the individual stocks had stock-specific news that went their way. So, it was a nice combination of those stock-specific news and market news in general.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what are your expectations for the earnings that she was just mentioning for some of these giants that are reporting soon?</p><p>LESKO: Well, the same factors that brought the stocks down heavily in the fourth quarter of last year led to analysts really cutting their estimates. So, these companies don`t need to grow that much to beat the lower expectations that Wall Street had set for them over the next few weeks so we expect a good earnings season out of technology.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what about the semiconductors? I mean, they are a, what, a benchmark for the whole industry right now, and they have suffered greatly. What`s your outlook for some of those companies right now? The Intels and others that are out there?</p><p>LESKO: Right. Well, certainly, you have Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) which both had mentioned and all three of them had very, very specific reasons why they were struggling against a broader technology that had done well and each of them had solved those problems that we were worried about.</p><p>So, in Intel`s case, they are getting out of the 5G chip business which they were really struggling in and investors saw that as a positive light. So, we really have good expectations for all three of the major chipmakers and all of them are trading at a reasonable valuation. So, there`s plenty of room for them.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Well, so far so good for that group as it moves higher.</p><p>Tim Lesko with Granite Investment Advisers -- thanks again for joining us tonight, Tim.</p><p>LESKO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it`s not just the tech sector moving higher. Other parts of the U.S. and global markets have also been rallying, just not today. The Dow was down three points, we were at 26,449 at the close; the Nasdaq fell by four; the S&amp;P 500 slipped by six.</p><p>Bob Pisani, though, has more on what has been working for investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. bucked the up trend in global markets on disappointing earnings and the continuing weakness in healthcare. But markets in Europe and Asia were up as China reported better first quarter GDP numbers than expected. GDP has been declining for years in China and the anticipation of a bottom there is the main mover of the global stock market in the past couple of months on the heels of the massive stimulus over there and the hopes for a trade deal.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 isn`t the only major index patterned near a new high. Stock exchanges in Russia, in China, in Saudi Arabia, all at 52-week highs. India is at an historic high.</p><p>The other main mover s have been earnings and fear of an earnings recession and two or more consecutive quarters of a decline on the S&amp;P 500 are dissipating as China avoids a meltdown and Europe kind of just muddles through. Analysts dramatically cut earnings estimates in December on those fears and they appear to have cut too much.</p><p>Just look today at the companies that are beating earnings on very wide margins, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Textron (NYSE:TXT), all beating earnings estimates by double digits, that`s far more than the typical earnings beat of about 3 percent. Only IBM with weak earnings growth and negative growth was a major disappointment today.</p><p>As a result, many sectors of the S&amp;P are at or near new highs, technology and consumer discretionary, consumer staples and communication services.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: More now on those growth numbers out of China overnight which seemed to signal stabilization in the world`s second largest economy, and it comes after that country flooded its economy with stimulus money.</p><p>Eunice Yoon reports for us tonight from Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Investors have been asking if China`s economy is bottoming out and it appears to be stabilizing. China`s GDP for the first quarter came in at 6.4 percent, slightly beating expectations of a slowdown. Industrial output was its strongest in four and a half years, 8.5 percent, possibly because the U.S. and China have been holding back on tariffs as well as seasonal factors, manufacturers were in full force after the lunar New Year holiday in February.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) said Beijing`s recent policy steps like tax cuts for consumers and local government bond sales showed up in the March data, retail sales jumped, fixed asset investment picked up, construction starts to jump 18.1 percent year on year from 6 percent in the previous month as the authorities loosened real estate curves. Analysts believe that this could mean China`s policymakers would hold up on further stimulus for now.</p><p>They also have to worry another factor: rising prices. Pork production fell by 5.2 percent year on year as China attempted to contain an outbreak of African swine fever in its hog population. Prices are expected to rise by more than 70 percent in the second half of the year, putting upward pressure on inflation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s turn to Mark Grant right now for more on the global markets. He is the global market strategist at B. Riley FBR.</p><p>Mark, good to see you again. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MARK GRANT, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST: Hi, Bill. Good to see you. Always a pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, the biggest concern, let`s face it, in the global economy has been China. What did you think of these numbers overnight? They were pretty impressive.</p><p>GRANT: They were certainly much better, Bill, than most people thought. The issue in my mind with China is the amount of stimulus that the government has been providing and the increased amount of debt and not only the corporate debt, but public debt in China that I think has gone a long way to stimulate their economy, plus their central bank, the People`s Bank of China has been adding quite a bit of money into the economy, and it`s -- I think that`s a big cause of the upward move here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So you`re concerned about that part of the equation, but what about the trade talks. We hear that the progress continues and they hope to have something signed by next month.</p><p>GRANT: You know, that`s what they say, they`ve indicated this before and I hope they do. I think it would certainly be good for the markets both in China and the United States if this gets accomplished. So, we`re all sitting around on Wall Street with our fingers crossed.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, indeed. Are there other parts of the global economy that you like better at this point? That you feel -- we had an analyst last night saying the emerging markets are attractive right now. What do you think?</p><p>GRANT: I don`t think that`s correct and my favorite market and the global markets right now is the United States because of the stability, because of very low interest rates, because the Fed has changed its course.</p><p>My biggest concern, by the way is in China, and it`s Europe. Europe on May 23rd, it has its national elections, or elections across the whole European Union.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>GRANT: And it looks to me, like, Bill, that the group that`s controlled the use since its inception which is the German-French alliance, the populist or the nationalists is what I think the better word is, but are going to get either a significant share of the new E.U. parliament or they might get the majority of the new E.U. parliament, and I think the European Union will be a very different place. So I`m very cautious on any investments in Europe right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And very quickly, all of the central banks around the world except ours right now seem to be loosening their monetary policy and you mentioned China, both elsewhere. But does that bother you at all?</p><p>GRANT: Well, I think it`s a positive that interest rates are lower, without any question. The Japanese central bank they have a balance sheet that`s equivalent to the entire GDP of Japan. The ECB has a balance sheet way larger than the Fed at this point, and they`re going to be lending more cheap money to the banks over there.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>GRANT: And the Fed has done a back flip, if you will, and has stabilized interest rates. I think that`s been a very positive for both the bond and the equity markets in the United States, and I think that`s going to continue.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Mark Grant with B. Riley FBR -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>GRANT: Thank you, Bill. Thank you, sir.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You bet.</p><p>Speaking about the Federal Reserve, it released its monthly anecdotal look at the U.S. economy today, and it showed moderate growth despite continued trade tensions and the severe flooding that we saw in the Midwest.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on the Fed`s Beige Book.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Reserve`s April Beige Book finding slightly moderate growth in the 12 districts of the Federal Reserve. It`s a similar report as last time, but some districts did see strengthening, consumer spending was mixed with sluggish sales for general retailers and for autos.</p><p>Now, the contexts in many districts reported, quote, trade related uncertainties with about as much concerned mentioned about trade and tariffs in this report as the last one. Employment continues to increase with the majority of districts in high-skilled jobs, and the weight pressure, especially for those high-skilled jobs, and most districts are saying there was modest wage growth.</p><p>Prices overall were up modestly with input costs increasing, including higher fuel prices, tariffs, freight costs and rising wages all driving the pricing trend here.</p><p>In St. Louis, retailers expected to be able to pass along their higher prices. Oh, by the way, in St. Louis, there was concern about flooding in Minneapolis and Kansas City as well affecting the agriculture industry.</p><p>But to the wages, Dallas reported elevated wage pressure. Philly, more than half of fall firms expected higher input costs. And New York City, there was a widening gap between the salary demands and salary offers that left some positions unfilled.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: One bit of economy news, our trade deficit with the world fell in February to its lowest levels since June of last year. That was well below what economist had been expecting, and the decline was due in large part to a 28 percent decline in the goods deficit with China, as exports to that country rose. In the meantime, as we mentioned trade negotiations with China are moving along.</p><p>According to the Dow Jones, U.S. and China are expecting to reach a deal as soon as May with the two countries setting a tentative time line for the next round of talks that involves Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer going to Beijing the last week of April.</p><p>Elsewhere, you take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\", with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) being downgraded today to hold from buy at Jefferies. The analyst cited some challenges when it comes to fees, service charges and net income. The price target now $32. That stock was up a fraction today to $30.03.</p><p>Paypal was downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS. The analyst says the monetization of its Venmo app is already priced into that stock. Price target now, $120. Shares were up modestly to $108.81.</p><p>And ride-hailing company Lyft was initiated with a neutral rating at Susquehanna today. The analysts says that Lyft investors should be concerned with the company`s position as the number two player behind Uber which will debut on its own on Wall Street next month. The price target on Lyft, $57. The stock was up nearly 6 percent today at $59.51.</p><p>Still ahead, automakers are plugging in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Phil LeBeau at the New York Auto Show, where electric vehicles like this one from Rivian are turning heads like never before. Why are so many people now considering an EV? That story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Zoom, one of the highly anticipated high tech companies coming public, reportedly has priced its initial public offering at $36 a share. That was above expectations. As we`ve been reporting, Zoom has been profitable, which sets it apart from some of the other tech companies that are coming public. Shares will begin trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol, ZM.</p><p>Well, one day after Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended their long-running legal battle, the CEO of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) today said that he is looking forward to working with the iPhone maker.</p><p>During an interview, Steve Mollenkopf also said that now is the time for his company to look to the future and focus on new opportunities including 5G.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MOLLENKOPF, QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEO: We did put the medal to the metal on 5G. I think it`s a right thing to do for the company. Independent of this relationship, and I`m sure it was important to this relationship as well. It`s a lot -- you know, the impact of 5G is just going to be tremendous, not only in the handset space but outside of the handset space.</p><p>We think we`re the clear leader and I think that`s going to be a good thing not only for our customers, but for our shareholders.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rose another 12 percent today, adding to that 20 percent gain we saw yesterday.</p><p>Pepsi shares rose to a record high today after the company reported solid quarterly results and said the investment in its snack business is paying off. That sent the stock up more than 3.5 percent to that all-time high.</p><p>Sara Eisen has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: PepsiCo is turning up growth a notch, posting its best sales growth in about three years. The key number for PepsiCo, organic revenue, growing 5.2 percent.</p><p>What`s behind that kind of growth? Well, snacks for one is doing much better. Growth in Frito-Lay in particular, the core brand fueling the gains, but also North American beverage business has come back lately.</p><p>Hugh Johnston, the CFO and the vice chairman of PepsiCo, says the portfolio is just working.</p><p>HUGH JOHNSTON, PEPSICO CFO: I think it`s a combination of a few things. Number one, you see continued portfolio strength, whether it`s our U.S. businesses, our international businesses across snacks and beverages, we just continue to see strong broad-based performance. In addition to that, our North American beverage business really has been strengthening over the last couple of quarters as we`ve invested in more advertising, we`ve invested in more execution.</p><p>EISEN: PepsiCo is spending a lot more these days on advertising just like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been doing. It`s also seeing better execution. For instance, when it comes to the sales force on the ground, just placing product in the store, Johnston tells me they`ve seen a lot more efficiencies that lead to higher profits and higher sales. He also says it`s a pretty consumer globally.</p><p>JOHNSTON: Within our segment of the economic world, we see a consumer that is capable of spending and is willing to spend on products that they really see is differentiated and adding value, and that`s what`s driving our focus behind putting money behind advertising, putting money behind innovation, because when you deliver something different that the consumer likes, they`re certainly willing to pay for it and buy lots of it.</p><p>EISEN: The market has also reflected Pepsi`s new growth prospect. The stock has outperformed Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and the rest of the staples so far in 2019, and it`s certainly upped the bar for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reporting earnings next week. It`s been hit a little bit harder by the strength of the U.S. dollar because it has a much bigger international business.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) topped Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the bank citing growth in its wealth management unit, as well as on cost-cuts.</p><p>James Gorman, the CEO, said that overall, results were solid despite a slow start to the year. On a call with analyst the outlook remains uncertain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES GORMAN, MORGAN STANLEY CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: The world remains uncertain. I`d love to think the next three quarters is the last three quarters of last year, but, you know, I`m a betting man and I`m not sure I make that bet right now. The world is uncertain, and until we see more clarity, we`re going to be very disciplined. It`s not a panic, we just, good schematic funds management.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shares rose more than 2.5 percent today to $48.26.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) reported a rise in commercial and mortgage lending, as well as some of its payments businesses and that helped the company report earnings that were in line with expectations although revenue was slightly below estimates. The CEO said the company was helped by rising interest rates and higher yields on securities, and shares rose a fraction today to $50.67.</p><p>American Airlines says it cannot yet forecast the cost of the 737 MAX groundings. The carrier says it`s still too early and too much uncertainty around that issue. Earlier this week, you may remember American canceled all 737 MAX flights at least through mid-August. That stock was up 1 percent today to $34.38.</p><p>And U.S. railroad operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) topped first quarter earnings estimates, its revenue was up 6 percent from last year, and it was helped by an increase in refined fuel and grain shipments to Mexico. The company gets one-third of its revenue from that country. The stock rose 4 percent today to $122.81.</p><p>Abbott Labs also reported a healthy profit and rise in sales, thanks to growth in its heart and diabetes care devices. The CEO said the company`s long term growth drivers are performing well and he`s targeting another year of strong sales. But investors apparently are focusing on regulatory uncertain with that talk in Washington about changes in healthcare insurance programs, and the stock fell 4.5 percent today to $72.88.</p><p>After the bell tonight, Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) reported higher revenue and better than expected profit. The gaming company cited growth in Macau, which is now the world`s largest gambling market, and that sent the stock higher in after-hours trading. It finished the regular session at $67.91.</p><p>While auto sales are gradually slowing, automakers believe that America is finally warming to buying an electric vehicle. And that may explain why plug-in models have been grabbing the headlines at this year`s New York Auto Show. That is where we find Phil LeBeau tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU: From electric pickups to luxury plug-ins to crossovers like the Jaguar I-PACE, automakers are embracing EVs like never before.</p><p>JOE EBERHARDT, JAGUAR LAND ROVER N.A. CEO: The performance is phenomenal. The driving dynamic is unlike any other car. So, customers are starting to really see the benefit of an electric vehicle as an everyday commuting vehicle. It`s part of the conversation.</p><p>LEBEAU: The conversation was sparked by Elon Musk and his company Tesla started rolling out luxury electric models six years ago. Now with the Tesla Model 3 starting at $35,000 and the base model Chevy Bolt selling for under $40, going green has become much more affordable.</p><p>DAVE HABIGER, JD POWER: The entry-level cars are 30, 40 grand when they used to be 60 and 70. And frankly, those 30 grand, 40 grand cars are going twice as long on battery as the cars two years ago did on 70.</p><p>LEBEAU: While traditional automakers like Audi are driving the EV discussion with new plug-ins, there are also start-ups like Rivian, turning heads with an all-electric pickup scheduled to go on sale in 2021.</p><p>RJ SCARINGE, RIVIAN CEO: Critical for us to get customers in is the vehicle has to give them a very strong reason to switch from an existing brand whether they`re in a truck or whether they`re in a Land Rover or BMW. It has to give them a really strong reason.</p><p>LEBEAU: Buyers maybe more interested in plug-in models, but electric vehicles still make up less than 3 percent of all U.S. auto sales, proof the industry still has a ways to go before it can convert electric vehicle interest into actual sales.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And to read more about the New York Auto Show this year, you can head to our website right now at NBR.com.</p><p>When we come back, can Godiva find growth outside their famous gold boxes of chocolate?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Companies certainly are always looking for new areas of growth, and today, a company best known for its chocolate is hoping to find the next leg of growth in cafes.</p><p>Courtney Reagan is in New York City for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When consumers think about Godiva, premium chocolate gifts is likely what comes to mind. After all, that`s the history of the nearly 100-year-old chocolate maker that sells in 105 countries and 800 retail locations globally.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have a great day.</p><p>REAGAN: Godiva`s CEO has a big plan to grow the business and a big part of that is new Godiva Cafes.</p><p>ANNIE YOUNG-SCRIVNER, GODIVA CEO: We feel that that could be a big piece of our growth for the future. In fact, around 40 percent of our revenue in the future can come from these cafes. We believe that we have the opportunity to fivefold our business over the next six years.</p><p>REAGAN: This new Godiva cafe opened officially in New York City on Thursday. It`s just one of 2,000 planned around the world. Four hundred ultimately will be in the United States. They sell chocolate, of course, but also different coffee drinks and craffles, which is a cross between a croissant and a waffle.</p><p>Young-Scrivner brings food and the beverage experience to Godiva. Before running the chocolate maker, she ran Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) digital and loyalty businesses. And before that, she ran Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) tea brand Teavana.</p><p>The food and beverage sector is a crowded space and not without risk. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) had nearly 400 Teavana stores under Young- Scrivner`s leadership, but ultimately, closed all of them two years ago.</p><p>There`s the expense of securing real estate in high-traffic locations, hiring and training employees and convincing consumers throughout treats into their diets.</p><p>PARMESH BHASKARAN, ALIXPARTNERS DIR., RESTAURANTS, HOSPITALITY &amp; LEISURE: Before there were only a chocolate, if I may say a store, now, they wanted to go into fresh foods. The supply chain is going to be very different. How well have they thought about the supply chain is also going to be critical in the space.</p><p>REAGAN: Godiva hopes the cafes provide a halo effect spurring other purchasing.</p><p>YOUNG-SCRIVNER: They have an opportunity to really open up digital where you can order online, pick up in store and that makes it really easy for our customers, as well.</p><p>REAGAN: Kind of like the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?</p><p>YOUNG-SCRIVNER: Or better.</p><p>REAGAN: Young-Scrivner is confident in her plans, and so is the taste and experience the Godiva cafe`s offer will be the deciding factor for consumers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. I`m Bill Griffeth. Thanks so much for watching.

A group closes at a new high, a big move considering it was battered and bruised just a few months ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shifting gears.  The major automakers are embracing electric vehicles and making green more affordable for drivers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sweet idea?  Can a company known for its gold box of chocolates find growth by expanding into an ultra competitive industry?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, April 17th.</p><p>And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.  Sue is off tonight.</p><p>Don`t look now, but big tech is making a very big comeback.  That sector has been powering higher the past few months, and today, the Nasdaq 100 closed at a record high.  That index is a basket of 100 largest and most actively traded companies on the Nasdaq, which is made up mostly of technology stocks.  It`s a remarkable turnaround for a group that was beaten down just a few months ago.</p><p>Bertha Coombs starts us off tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Nasdaq 100`s gains today were driven by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and chip technology firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) after the tech giants announced that they had settled their longstanding patent dispute.  Large cap tech names dominate on the Nasdaq 100 and it has been their strong recovery in 2019 that has pushed the index to a new record high after what was a brutal year end of 2018.</p><p>The semiconductor sector is a prime example.  Semis fell 18 percent in the fourth quarter and concerns the U.S.-China trade war would make it difficult for manufacturers to import chips to the U.S.  The trade headlines have improved.  Chipmakers have seen a strong recovery with new highs today for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), and a new record for the sector.</p><p>The biggest contributors to the Nasdaq 100`s gains year to date have been four of the tech heavyweights that suffered big losses in December.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is now up 36 percent.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) up 28 percent and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) up 24 percent and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) up 20.</p><p>But the next big catalyst for this group is going to be earnings, with all four scheduled to in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs at the Nasdaq.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Timothy Lesko joins us now to talk more about technology and what`s driving it.  He`s principal at Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>Tim, always good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PRINCIPAL:  Thanks for having me, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, just a few months ago, and as Bertha was pointing out, down so sharply and now we`re back.  But does that mean the problems that were plaguing the group, the problems with semiconductors, the slowdown in sales for smartphones, the trade concerns, are those gone now?</p><p>LESKO:  I wouldn`t say that all of the concerns are gone, but a few have been taken off the table, particularly investors see that the Chinese trade negotiations seem to be going well or better than anybody expected and on top of that a few of the individual stocks had stock-specific news that went their way.  So, it was a nice combination of those stock-specific news and market news in general.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And what are your expectations for the earnings that she was just mentioning for some of these giants that are reporting soon?</p><p>LESKO:  Well, the same factors that brought the stocks down heavily in the fourth quarter of last year led to analysts really cutting their estimates.  So, these companies don`t need to grow that much to beat the lower expectations that Wall Street had set for them over the next few weeks so we expect a good earnings season out of technology.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And what about the semiconductors?  I mean, they are a, what, a benchmark for the whole industry right now, and they have suffered greatly.  What`s your outlook for some of those companies right now?  The Intels and others that are out there?</p><p>LESKO:  Right.  Well, certainly, you have Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) which both had mentioned and all three of them had very, very specific reasons why they were struggling against a broader technology that had done well and each of them had solved those problems that we were worried about.</p><p>So, in Intel`s case, they are getting out of the 5G chip business which they were really struggling in and investors saw that as a positive light.  So, we really have good expectations for all three of the major chipmakers and all of them are trading at a reasonable valuation.  So, there`s plenty of room for them.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Well, so far so good for that group as it moves higher.</p><p>Tim Lesko with Granite Investment Advisers -- thanks again for joining us tonight, Tim.</p><p>LESKO:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And it`s not just the tech sector moving higher.  Other parts of the U.S. and global markets have also been rallying, just not today.  The Dow was down three points, we were at 26,449 at the close; the Nasdaq fell by four; the S&amp;P 500 slipped by six.</p><p>Bob Pisani, though, has more on what has been working for investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S. bucked the up trend in global markets on disappointing earnings and the continuing weakness in healthcare.  But markets in Europe and Asia were up as China reported better first quarter GDP numbers than expected.  GDP has been declining for years in China and the anticipation of a bottom there is the main mover of the global stock market in the past couple of months on the heels of the massive stimulus over there and the hopes for a trade deal.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 isn`t the only major index patterned near a new high.  Stock exchanges in Russia, in China, in Saudi Arabia, all at 52-week highs.  India is at an historic high.</p><p>The other main mover s have been earnings and fear of an earnings recession and two or more consecutive quarters of a decline on the S&amp;P 500 are dissipating as China avoids a meltdown and Europe kind of just muddles through.  Analysts dramatically cut earnings estimates in December on those fears and they appear to have cut too much.</p><p>Just look today at the companies that are beating earnings on very wide margins, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Textron (NYSE:TXT), all beating earnings estimates by double digits, that`s far more than the typical earnings beat of about 3 percent.  Only IBM with weak earnings growth and negative growth was a major disappointment today.</p><p>As a result, many sectors of the S&amp;P are at or near new highs, technology and consumer discretionary, consumer staples and communication services.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  More now on those growth numbers out of China overnight which seemed to signal stabilization in the world`s second largest economy, and it comes after that country flooded its economy with stimulus money.</p><p>Eunice Yoon reports for us tonight from Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors have been asking if China`s economy is bottoming out and it appears to be stabilizing.  China`s GDP for the first quarter came in at 6.4 percent, slightly beating expectations of a slowdown.  Industrial output was its strongest in four and a half years, 8.5 percent, possibly because the U.S. and China have been holding back on tariffs as well as seasonal factors, manufacturers were in full force after the lunar New Year holiday in February.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) said Beijing`s recent policy steps like tax cuts for consumers and local government bond sales showed up in the March data, retail sales jumped, fixed asset investment picked up, construction starts to jump 18.1 percent year on year from 6 percent in the previous month as the authorities loosened real estate curves.  Analysts believe that this could mean China`s policymakers would hold up on further stimulus for now.</p><p>They also have to worry another factor: rising prices.  Pork production fell by 5.2 percent year on year as China attempted to contain an outbreak of African swine fever in its hog population.  Prices are expected to rise by more than 70 percent in the second half of the year, putting upward pressure on inflation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s turn to Mark Grant right now for more on the global markets.  He is the global market strategist at B. Riley FBR.</p><p>Mark, good to see you again.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MARK GRANT, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  Hi, Bill.  Good to see you.  Always a pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, the biggest concern, let`s face it, in the global economy has been China.  What did you think of these numbers overnight?  They were pretty impressive.</p><p>GRANT:  They were certainly much better, Bill, than most people thought.  The issue in my mind with China is the amount of stimulus that the government has been providing and the increased amount of debt and not only the corporate debt, but public debt in China that I think has gone a long way to stimulate their economy, plus their central bank, the People`s Bank of China has been adding quite a bit of money into the economy, and it`s -- I think that`s a big cause of the upward move here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So you`re concerned about that part of the equation, but what about the trade talks.  We hear that the progress continues and they hope to have something signed by next month.</p><p>GRANT:  You know, that`s what they say, they`ve indicated this before and I hope they do.  I think it would certainly be good for the markets both in China and the United States if this gets accomplished.  So, we`re all sitting around on Wall Street with our fingers crossed.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, indeed.  Are there other parts of the global economy that you like better at this point?  That you feel -- we had an analyst last night saying the emerging markets are attractive right now.  What do you think?</p><p>GRANT:  I don`t think that`s correct and my favorite market and the global markets right now is the United States because of the stability, because of very low interest rates, because the Fed has changed its course.</p><p>My biggest concern, by the way is in China, and it`s Europe.  Europe on May 23rd, it has its national elections, or elections across the whole European Union.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>GRANT:  And it looks to me, like, Bill, that the group that`s controlled the use since its inception which is the German-French alliance, the populist or the nationalists is what I think the better word is, but are going to get either a significant share of the new E.U. parliament or they might get the majority of the new E.U. parliament, and I think the European Union will be a very different place.  So I`m very cautious on any investments in Europe right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And very quickly, all of the central banks around the world except ours right now seem to be loosening their monetary policy and you mentioned China, both elsewhere.  But does that bother you at all?</p><p>GRANT:  Well, I think it`s a positive that interest rates are lower, without any question.  The Japanese central bank they have a balance sheet that`s equivalent to the entire GDP of Japan.  The ECB has a balance sheet way larger than the Fed at this point, and they`re going to be lending more cheap money to the banks over there.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>GRANT:  And the Fed has done a back flip, if you will, and has stabilized interest rates.  I think that`s been a very positive for both the bond and the equity markets in the United States, and I think that`s going to continue.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Mark Grant with B. Riley FBR -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>GRANT:  Thank you, Bill.  Thank you, sir.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You bet.</p><p>Speaking about the Federal Reserve, it released its monthly anecdotal look at the U.S. economy today, and it showed moderate growth despite continued trade tensions and the severe flooding that we saw in the Midwest.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on the Fed`s Beige Book.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve`s April Beige Book finding slightly moderate growth in the 12 districts of the Federal Reserve.  It`s a similar report as last time, but some districts did see strengthening, consumer spending was mixed with sluggish sales for general retailers and for autos.</p><p>Now, the contexts in many districts reported, quote, trade related uncertainties with about as much concerned mentioned about trade and tariffs in this report as the last one.  Employment continues to increase with the majority of districts in high-skilled jobs, and the weight pressure, especially for those high-skilled jobs, and most districts are saying there was modest wage growth.</p><p>Prices overall were up modestly with input costs increasing, including higher fuel prices, tariffs, freight costs and rising wages all driving the pricing trend here.</p><p>In St. Louis, retailers expected to be able to pass along their higher prices.  Oh, by the way, in St. Louis, there was concern about flooding in Minneapolis and Kansas City as well affecting the agriculture industry.</p><p>But to the wages, Dallas reported elevated wage pressure.  Philly, more than half of fall firms expected higher input costs.  And New York City, there was a widening gap between the salary demands and salary offers that left some positions unfilled.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  One bit of economy news, our trade deficit with the world fell in February to its lowest levels since June of last year.  That was well below what economist had been expecting, and the decline was due in large part to a 28 percent decline in the goods deficit with China, as exports to that country rose.  In the meantime, as we mentioned trade negotiations with China are moving along.</p><p>According to the Dow Jones, U.S. and China are expecting to reach a deal as soon as May with the two countries setting a tentative time line for the next round of talks that involves Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer going to Beijing the last week of April.</p><p>Elsewhere, you take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\", with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) being downgraded today to hold from buy at Jefferies.  The analyst cited some challenges when it comes to fees, service charges and net income.  The price target now $32.  That stock was up a fraction today to $30.03.</p><p>Paypal was downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS.  The analyst says the monetization of its Venmo app is already priced into that stock.  Price target now, $120.  Shares were up modestly to $108.81.</p><p>And ride-hailing company Lyft was initiated with a neutral rating at Susquehanna today.  The analysts says that Lyft investors should be concerned with the company`s position as the number two player behind Uber which will debut on its own on Wall Street next month.  The price target on Lyft, $57.  The stock was up nearly 6 percent today at $59.51.</p><p>Still ahead, automakers are plugging in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Phil LeBeau at the New York Auto Show, where electric vehicles like this one from Rivian are turning heads like never before.  Why are so many people now considering an EV?  That story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Zoom, one of the highly anticipated high tech companies coming public, reportedly has priced its initial public offering at $36 a share.  That was above expectations.  As we`ve been reporting, Zoom has been profitable, which sets it apart from some of the other tech companies that are coming public.  Shares will begin trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol, ZM.</p><p>Well, one day after Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended their long-running legal battle, the CEO of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) today said that he is looking forward to working with the iPhone maker.</p><p>During an interview, Steve Mollenkopf also said that now is the time for his company to look to the future and focus on new opportunities including 5G.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MOLLENKOPF, QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEO:  We did put the medal to the metal on 5G.  I think it`s a right thing to do for the company.  Independent of this relationship, and I`m sure it was important to this relationship as well.  It`s a lot -- you know, the impact of 5G is just going to be tremendous, not only in the handset space but outside of the handset space.</p><p>We think we`re the clear leader and I think that`s going to be a good thing not only for our customers, but for our shareholders.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rose another 12 percent today, adding to that 20 percent gain we saw yesterday.</p><p>Pepsi shares rose to a record high today after the company reported solid quarterly results and said the investment in its snack business is paying off.  That sent the stock up more than 3.5 percent to that all-time high.</p><p>Sara Eisen has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  PepsiCo is turning up growth a notch, posting its best sales growth in about three years.  The key number for PepsiCo, organic revenue, growing 5.2 percent.</p><p>What`s behind that kind of growth?  Well, snacks for one is doing much better.  Growth in Frito-Lay in particular, the core brand fueling the gains, but also North American beverage business has come back lately.</p><p>Hugh Johnston, the CFO and the vice chairman of PepsiCo, says the portfolio is just working.</p><p>HUGH JOHNSTON, PEPSICO CFO:  I think it`s a combination of a few things.  Number one, you see continued portfolio strength, whether it`s our U.S. businesses, our international businesses across snacks and beverages, we just continue to see strong broad-based performance.  In addition to that, our North American beverage business really has been strengthening over the last couple of quarters as we`ve invested in more advertising, we`ve invested in more execution.</p><p>EISEN:  PepsiCo is spending a lot more these days on advertising just like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been doing.  It`s also seeing better execution.  For instance, when it comes to the sales force on the ground, just placing product in the store, Johnston tells me they`ve seen a lot more efficiencies that lead to higher profits and higher sales.  He also says it`s a pretty consumer globally.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  Within our segment of the economic world, we see a consumer that is capable of spending and is willing to spend on products that they really see is differentiated and adding value, and that`s what`s driving our focus behind putting money behind advertising, putting money behind innovation, because when you deliver something different that the consumer likes, they`re certainly willing to pay for it and buy lots of it.</p><p>EISEN:  The market has also reflected Pepsi`s new growth prospect.  The stock has outperformed Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and the rest of the staples so far in 2019, and it`s certainly upped the bar for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reporting earnings next week.  It`s been hit a little bit harder by the strength of the U.S. dollar because it has a much bigger international business.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) topped Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the bank citing growth in its wealth management unit, as well as on cost-cuts.</p><p>James Gorman, the CEO, said that overall, results were solid despite a slow start to the year.  On a call with analyst the outlook remains uncertain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES GORMAN, MORGAN STANLEY CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  The world remains uncertain.  I`d love to think the next three quarters is the last three quarters of last year, but, you know, I`m a betting man and I`m not sure I make that bet right now.  The world is uncertain, and until we see more clarity, we`re going to be very disciplined.  It`s not a panic, we just, good schematic funds management.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shares rose more than 2.5 percent today to $48.26.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) reported a rise in commercial and mortgage lending, as well as some of its payments businesses and that helped the company report earnings that were in line with expectations although revenue was slightly below estimates.  The CEO said the company was helped by rising interest rates and higher yields on securities, and shares rose a fraction today to $50.67.</p><p>American Airlines says it cannot yet forecast the cost of the 737 MAX groundings.  The carrier says it`s still too early and too much uncertainty around that issue.  Earlier this week, you may remember American canceled all 737 MAX flights at least through mid-August.  That stock was up 1 percent today to $34.38.</p><p>And U.S. railroad operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) topped first quarter earnings estimates, its revenue was up 6 percent from last year, and it was helped by an increase in refined fuel and grain shipments to Mexico.  The company gets one-third of its revenue from that country.  The stock rose 4 percent today to $122.81.</p><p>Abbott Labs also reported a healthy profit and rise in sales, thanks to growth in its heart and diabetes care devices.  The CEO said the company`s long term growth drivers are performing well and he`s targeting another year of strong sales.  But investors apparently are focusing on regulatory uncertain with that talk in Washington about changes in healthcare insurance programs, and the stock fell 4.5 percent today to $72.88.</p><p>After the bell tonight, Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) reported higher revenue and better than expected profit.  The gaming company cited growth in Macau, which is now the world`s largest gambling market, and that sent the stock higher in after-hours trading.  It finished the regular session at $67.91.</p><p>While auto sales are gradually slowing, automakers believe that America is finally warming to buying an electric vehicle.  And that may explain why plug-in models have been grabbing the headlines at this year`s New York Auto Show.  That is where we find Phil LeBeau tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU:  From electric pickups to luxury plug-ins to crossovers like the Jaguar I-PACE, automakers are embracing EVs like never before.</p><p>JOE EBERHARDT, JAGUAR LAND ROVER N.A. CEO:  The performance is phenomenal.  The driving dynamic is unlike any other car.  So, customers are starting to really see the benefit of an electric vehicle as an everyday commuting vehicle.  It`s part of the conversation.</p><p>LEBEAU:  The conversation was sparked by Elon Musk and his company Tesla started rolling out luxury electric models six years ago.  Now with the Tesla Model 3 starting at $35,000 and the base model Chevy Bolt selling for under $40, going green has become much more affordable.</p><p>DAVE HABIGER, JD POWER:  The entry-level cars are 30, 40 grand when they used to be 60 and 70.  And frankly, those 30 grand, 40 grand cars are going twice as long on battery as the cars two years ago did on 70.</p><p>LEBEAU:  While traditional automakers like Audi are driving the EV discussion with new plug-ins, there are also start-ups like Rivian, turning heads with an all-electric pickup scheduled to go on sale in 2021.</p><p>RJ SCARINGE, RIVIAN CEO:  Critical for us to get customers in is the vehicle has to give them a very strong reason to switch from an existing brand whether they`re in a truck or whether they`re in a Land Rover or BMW.  It has to give them a really strong reason.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Buyers maybe more interested in plug-in models, but electric vehicles still make up less than 3 percent of all U.S. auto sales, proof the industry still has a ways to go before it can convert electric vehicle interest into actual sales.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And to read more about the New York Auto Show this year, you can head to our website right now at NBR.com.</p><p>When we come back, can Godiva find growth outside their famous gold boxes of chocolate?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Companies certainly are always looking for new areas of growth, and today, a company best known for its chocolate is hoping to find the next leg of growth in cafes.</p><p>Courtney Reagan is in New York City for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  When consumers think about Godiva, premium chocolate gifts is likely what comes to mind.  After all, that`s the history of the nearly 100-year-old chocolate maker that sells in 105 countries and 800 retail locations globally.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Have a great day.</p><p>REAGAN:  Godiva`s CEO has a big plan to grow the business and a big part of that is new Godiva Cafes.</p><p>ANNIE YOUNG-SCRIVNER, GODIVA CEO:  We feel that that could be a big piece of our growth for the future.  In fact, around 40 percent of our revenue in the future can come from these cafes.  We believe that we have the opportunity to fivefold our business over the next six years.</p><p>REAGAN:  This new Godiva cafe opened officially in New York City on Thursday.  It`s just one of 2,000 planned around the world.  Four hundred ultimately will be in the United States.  They sell chocolate, of course, but also different coffee drinks and craffles, which is a cross between a croissant and a waffle.</p><p>Young-Scrivner brings food and the beverage experience to Godiva.  Before running the chocolate maker, she ran Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) digital and loyalty businesses.  And before that, she ran Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) tea brand Teavana.</p><p>The food and beverage sector is a crowded space and not without risk.  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) had nearly 400 Teavana stores under Young-Scrivner`s leadership, but ultimately, closed all of them two years ago.</p><p>There`s the expense of securing real estate in high-traffic locations, hiring and training employees and convincing consumers throughout treats into their diets.</p><p>PARMESH BHASKARAN, ALIXPARTNERS DIR., RESTAURANTS, HOSPITALITY &amp; LEISURE:  Before there were only a chocolate, if I may say a store, now, they wanted to go into fresh foods.  The supply chain is going to be very different.  How well have they thought about the supply chain is also going to be critical in the space.</p><p>REAGAN:  Godiva hopes the cafes provide a halo effect spurring other purchasing.</p><p>YOUNG-SCRIVNER:  They have an opportunity to really open up digital where you can order online, pick up in store and that makes it really easy for our customers, as well.</p><p>REAGAN:  Kind of like the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?</p><p>YOUNG-SCRIVNER:  Or better.</p><p>REAGAN:  Young-Scrivner is confident in her plans, and so is the taste and experience the Godiva cafe`s offer will be the deciding factor for consumers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.

A big night for technology as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM report earnings. We'll look at the winners and the losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Stocks slide again. Mixed earnings and a batch of economic numbers that missed projections drag down the major indexes.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: China's cheap labor -- well, at least that was the case. But as costs rise, are some U.S. manufacturers thinking about pulling out?</p><p/><p>All that and more tonight on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, April the 18th.</p><p/><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. I'm Bill Griffeth, in this week for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p/><p>And, Susie, it's clear. Once again, that technology is going to set the tone for tomorrow, don't you think?</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM. Three huge technology companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell tonight with mixed results.</p><p/><p>The results are important given new concerns about slowing global economic growth. And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers this year. The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech suppliers and component makers on Friday.</p><p/><p>And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p/><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this evening, and that's where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p/><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Susie, a big day for tech. Let's run through the numbers.</p><p/><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line. CEO Steve Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off. The tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company at the end of the year. It will name its new CFO in the next several weeks.</p><p/><p>Let's also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Shares are up after hours. The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of $10.66. However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p/><p>And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due to a decline in hardware and services sales. Its first quarter EPS came in at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p/><p>The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM's one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time. And if that's the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p/><p>We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p/><p>Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Seema, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks it's headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group.</p><p/><p>Welcome back.</p><p/><p>ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST: Thank you.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: All three that reported tonight missed on the top line. They were light on revenue. Does that worry you?</p><p/><p>KUMAR: No, I think these are cyclical trends. In near term, I think the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is weak across the developed markets. And they're seeing customers slow down across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p/><p>And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy among the large corporate accounts. So, it's more cyclical in nature than secular.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: You know, this has been a tough time for technology companies, technology earnings. And there are so many changes happening in the technology space. And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once, you know, the darling of the tech sector.</p><p/><p>Now it's, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak. What is it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus an also-ran?</p><p/><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) story, I think the company's meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100 to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in terms of price and unit. So the company came in and dominated the tablet market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone segment.</p><p/><p>And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of course, it's on the other side of that mountain, so to speak. So, over $200 billion of market cap has been removed. And so the company is looking forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: We keep hearing the migration to mobile. We all have tablets. We all have smartphones.</p><p/><p>What about the PC? Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the personal computer right now?</p><p/><p>KUMAR: I think it's become -- Bill, it's become primarily a replacement in a market. In other words, the life cycle of the PC continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications that are being written for the PC platform. So the go-to platform or the post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and that's where the application developer community is focused on.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: You see a wide range of technology companies. Let me just get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think have the platforms that are on the cutting edge. And maybe not any of the companies that we've been talking about tonight that reported earnings.</p><p/><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. That's a very good point because it seems that investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: And what about an IBM? I mean, so influential for years. They've made this transition through the services industry. They were cutting edge on that. What did you think of their earnings, and where do you think they're going from here?</p><p/><p>KUMAR: Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM. I think they were early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and services in the '90s. So the company's portfolio, if you look at it in a longer-term perspective, it's very counter-cyclical. So they're able to write the software and services, they're in a position to grow, you know, the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p/><p>So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the near-term performance. But from a longer-term perspective, they're very well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: So, this has been a big week for technology earnings. A lot of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on trading tomorrow. Do you think that this latest batch is going to influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way?</p><p/><p>KUMAR: No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes. But longer term, I think technology sector creates a tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments. It's global in theme, it's secular in themes. So, I think these are cyclical factors that are impacting performance.</p><p/><p>But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p/><p>KUMAR: Thank you.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the major averages lower.</p><p/><p>The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4 percent more. We'll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\". And the NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about, closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p/><p>Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p/><p>Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000 last week. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month. And the read on leading economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first time in four months.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this year. And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.</p><p/><p>The country's largest auto dealership owner reported that first quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with revenues that topped $4 billion. Sales of new and used cars were higher last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even announced plans to expand.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now.</p><p/><p>Mike, nice to see you again.</p><p/><p>I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p/><p>MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION: Well, Susie, you have to look at it within the context in the auto industry. We had a depression, a complete crash, a complete breakdown in '08, '09, '10. We could not get financing for our customers. So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p/><p>And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in America to 11 years old. It's unprecedented. And people really need to do something at this point. The trades we're looking at have 150,000 miles on it. So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and now there's genuine replacement need.</p><p/><p>So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering ever, outstanding quality. And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p/><p>JACKSON: -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel economy. We don't ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don't have to buy exotic hybrids or electric. Mainstream technology will give you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p/><p>And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p/><p>JACKSON: We were the first payment-to-household made. So the banks have really moved back into financing cars.</p><p/><p>So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive recovery.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: It's clear to see why you're a superstar salesman, Mike.</p><p/><p>One of the trends we've seen in the recovery has been the tremendous strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market. Is that still the case? Are people tending to buy more used cars than they did in the past?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: Well, the used car story is the following. We are selling big improvements in used cars and new cars. And because there's such a shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low from '08, '09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p/><p>So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give you more money for your trade than you're ever going to get. And they say, great, I'm ready to get something newer, whether it's still used or new.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Let me ask you this, Mike. I know you hear this all the time. Everybody's talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest rates and talking about at some point they're going to go up. When interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in buying a car and to finance it?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows that it will not continue. I should be clear, the market rate that customers are paying today, let's say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a manufacturer. So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p/><p>But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on the financing of an automobile. So I don't think the normalization of interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I've called out that are driving this recovery. We're in the early innings of this automotive recovery. We're on a journey back to the industry, selling 16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: So, that's nice to end on an upbeat note.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mike. So good to see you. Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation (NYSE:AN).</p><p/><p>JACKSON: Good to see you.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the program, we'll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when that sector reports.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p/><p>But it wasn't all positive. The company also said first quarter profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare services. The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p/><p>United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint, all down at least 2 percent at the close.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter. Shares hit a new all-time high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent.</p><p/><p>PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price increases helped boost profit margins. Revenues in its snack business improved as well, particularly in China. Pepsi gained more than 3 percent, closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock trading volume. But investors did focus on weakness in the company's bond trading unit. Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than 5 percent on the day.</p><p/><p>And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis. And that sent shares soaring after hours. Vertex's two drug therapy improved patients' lung function in a phase 2 study. Now, shares had closed down at the end of the session. But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50 percent in after-hours trade.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in profits, and that's thanks to stronger sales. And said it expects to open as many as 180 new locations this year. The company restated its guidance of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p/><p>Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p/><p>And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many American companies looking for cheap labor. But that could be all about to change.</p><p/><p>First, let's take a look at how the international markets finished the day.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more money shopping than at Walmart.</p><p/><p>As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how important Walmart's results are to investors and what they might reveal about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season, the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of the consumer amid continued uncertainty. And for decades running, it's the earnings released from the world's largest retailer that is perhaps the most anticipated.</p><p/><p>JAN KNIFFEN: Walmart is the bellwether. And other than the time period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has always been the bellwether.</p><p/><p>REAGAN: A bellwether for good reason. Every week, more than 200 million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around the world. For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p/><p>Walmart's U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch. It measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a year. While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p/><p>(on camera): Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning investors that its earnings will miss expectations. Saying the lingering cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items. Investors are now wondering if Walmart's sales have been equally impacted.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from Walmart's consumer research. Every quarter, the company surveys its shoppers to take the pulse of what's concerning them most. Last quarter, Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p/><p>Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren't worried.</p><p/><p>KNIFFEN: I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has ever run since I started watching them in 1968. They are doing a fabulous job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p/><p>REAGAN: And the stockholders are reaping the benefits. Walmart shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one company to watch this earnings season.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers, move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save money. But things have changed. Rising costs for labor, material and shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those jobs back home.</p><p/><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Here in Shanghai, U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new challenge, rising costs. In fact, a new study out today finds that the total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the U.S. by 2015.</p><p/><p>For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in Shanghai are rising faster than expected. For example, labor wages are jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain skilled workers. They've got 110 employees here in China, making components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Honeywell. And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually move out of Shanghai.</p><p/><p>MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO: We're looking at different areas in China. Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area. But in the next five to seven years, I would say we'll definitely be somewhere further inland.</p><p/><p>LEBEAU: Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in China compared to India, Mexico and the United States. Meanwhile, China's currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10 years.</p><p/><p>Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years. Now, analysts believe the cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the U.S. within a couple of years.</p><p/><p>STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: If you go back to 2005, it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30 percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States. Based on our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been closed.</p><p/><p>LEBEAU: The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers, will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.?</p><p/><p>Well, don't expect a huge rush of re-shoring. There may be a few companies to bring jobs back. What's more likely is they will keep their China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S. plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p/><p>One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in China, productivity. Now, it's improving here in China, but it's still not to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S. manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative to firms here in China.</p><p/><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we'll look at whether China, the world's largest auto market, is about to become the world's most lucrative market for luxury carmakers.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p/><p>First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies fared today.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: You can call it a whale of a deal. SeaWorld Entertainment -- this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange. It's offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27 each, raising $702 million.</p><p/><p>Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash.</p><p/><p>The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt and grow its business.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY: I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can't see that stuff in Kansas.</p><p/><p>WELLS: SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and the new owners return it had to profitability. The recession put the business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45 million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p/><p>Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego.</p><p/><p>TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE: SeaWorld is one of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p/><p>WELLS (on camera): But there are risks. The company says it has nearly $1.7 billion in debt. And when your entire business model is built around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): The company is appealing federal safety violations after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago. SeaWorld warns it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses to keep animals.</p><p/><p>But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from other theme park companies.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so much, so I can't wait for my son to have that in his life as well.</p><p/><p>WELLS: Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up under water.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we'll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p/><p>And, Bill, I understand that he's bringing a penguin to help him ring the opening bell tomorrow morning.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: One of the best-dressed bell ringers they've had at the New York Stock Exchange in quite a while. It's a great family story, but can they continue to grow this franchise? It's pretty long in the tooth.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: I'll ask him. We'll find out.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Exactly.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: I'll report back tomorrow.</p><p/><p>And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

Once again, that technology is going to set the tone for tomorrow, don't you think?</p><p>GHARIB: Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM. Three huge technology companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell tonight with mixed results.</p><p>The results are important given new concerns about slowing global economic growth. And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers this year. The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech suppliers and component makers on Friday.</p><p>And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this evening, and that's where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Susie, a big day for tech. Let's run through the numbers.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line. CEO Steve Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off. The tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company at the end of the year. It will name its new CFO in the next several weeks.</p><p>Let's also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Shares are up after hours. The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of $10.66. However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p>And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due to a decline in hardware and services sales. Its first quarter EPS came in at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p>The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM's one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time. And if that's the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p>We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p>Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks it's headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group.</p><p>Welcome back.</p><p>ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All three that reported tonight missed on the top line. They were light on revenue. Does that worry you?</p><p>KUMAR: No, I think these are cyclical trends. In near term, I think the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is weak across the developed markets. And they're seeing customers slow down across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p>And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy among the large corporate accounts. So, it's more cyclical in nature than secular.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, this has been a tough time for technology companies, technology earnings. And there are so many changes happening in the technology space. And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once, you know, the darling of the tech sector.</p><p>Now it's, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak. What is it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus an also-ran?</p><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) story, I think the company's meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100 to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in terms of price and unit. So the company came in and dominated the tablet market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone segment.</p><p>And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of course, it's on the other side of that mountain, so to speak. So, over $200 billion of market cap has been removed. And so the company is looking forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We keep hearing the migration to mobile. We all have tablets. We all have smartphones.</p><p>What about the PC? Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the personal computer right now?</p><p>KUMAR: I think it's become -- Bill, it's become primarily a replacement in a market. In other words, the life cycle of the PC continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications that are being written for the PC platform. So the go-to platform or the post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and that's where the application developer community is focused on.</p><p>GHARIB: You see a wide range of technology companies. Let me just get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think have the platforms that are on the cutting edge. And maybe not any of the companies that we've been talking about tonight that reported earnings.</p><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. That's a very good point because it seems that investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what about an IBM? I mean, so influential for years. They've made this transition through the services industry. They were cutting edge on that. What did you think of their earnings, and where do you think they're going from here?</p><p>KUMAR: Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM. I think they were early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and services in the '90s. So the company's portfolio, if you look at it in a longer-term perspective, it's very counter-cyclical. So they're able to write the software and services, they're in a position to grow, you know, the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p>So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the near-term performance. But from a longer-term perspective, they're very well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p>GHARIB: So, this has been a big week for technology earnings. A lot of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on trading tomorrow. Do you think that this latest batch is going to influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way?</p><p>KUMAR: No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes. But longer term, I think technology sector creates a tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments. It's global in theme, it's secular in themes. So, I think these are cyclical factors that are impacting performance.</p><p>But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>KUMAR: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the major averages lower.</p><p>The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4 percent more. We'll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\". And the NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about, closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p>Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p>Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000 last week. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month. And the read on leading economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first time in four months.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this year. And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.</p><p>The country's largest auto dealership owner reported that first quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with revenues that topped $4 billion. Sales of new and used cars were higher last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even announced plans to expand.</p><p>GHARIB: AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now.</p><p>Mike, nice to see you again.</p><p>I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p>MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION: Well, Susie, you have to look at it within the context in the auto industry. We had a depression, a complete crash, a complete breakdown in '08, '09, '10. We could not get financing for our customers. So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p>And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in America to 11 years old. It's unprecedented. And people really need to do something at this point. The trades we're looking at have 150,000 miles on it. So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and now there's genuine replacement need.</p><p>So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering ever, outstanding quality. And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>JACKSON: -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel economy. We don't ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don't have to buy exotic hybrids or electric. Mainstream technology will give you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p>And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>JACKSON: We were the first payment-to-household made. So the banks have really moved back into financing cars.</p><p>So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive recovery.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It's clear to see why you're a superstar salesman, Mike.</p><p>One of the trends we've seen in the recovery has been the tremendous strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market. Is that still the case? Are people tending to buy more used cars than they did in the past?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, the used car story is the following. We are selling big improvements in used cars and new cars. And because there's such a shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low from '08, '09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p>So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give you more money for your trade than you're ever going to get. And they say, great, I'm ready to get something newer, whether it's still used or new.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me ask you this, Mike. I know you hear this all the time. Everybody's talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest rates and talking about at some point they're going to go up. When interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in buying a car and to finance it?</p><p>JACKSON: No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows that it will not continue. I should be clear, the market rate that customers are paying today, let's say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a manufacturer. So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on the financing of an automobile. So I don't think the normalization of interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I've called out that are driving this recovery. We're in the early innings of this automotive recovery. We're on a journey back to the industry, selling 16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p>GHARIB: So, that's nice to end on an upbeat note.</p><p>Thank you, Mike. So good to see you. Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation (NYSE:AN).</p><p>JACKSON: Good to see you.</p><p>GHARIB: And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the program, we'll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when that sector reports.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>But it wasn't all positive. The company also said first quarter profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare services. The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p>United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint, all down at least 2 percent at the close.</p><p>GHARIB: Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter. Shares hit a new all-time high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent.</p><p>PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price increases helped boost profit margins. Revenues in its snack business improved as well, particularly in China. Pepsi gained more than 3 percent, closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock trading volume. But investors did focus on weakness in the company's bond trading unit. Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than 5 percent on the day.</p><p>And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis. And that sent shares soaring after hours. Vertex's two drug therapy improved patients' lung function in a phase 2 study. Now, shares had closed down at the end of the session. But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50 percent in after-hours trade.</p><p>GHARIB: And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in profits, and that's thanks to stronger sales. And said it expects to open as many as 180 new locations this year. The company restated its guidance of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many American companies looking for cheap labor. But that could be all about to change.</p><p>First, let's take a look at how the international markets finished the day.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more money shopping than at Walmart.</p><p>As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how important Walmart's results are to investors and what they might reveal about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season, the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of the consumer amid continued uncertainty. And for decades running, it's the earnings released from the world's largest retailer that is perhaps the most anticipated.</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN: Walmart is the bellwether. And other than the time period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has always been the bellwether.</p><p>REAGAN: A bellwether for good reason. Every week, more than 200 million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around the world. For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch. It measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a year. While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p>(on camera): Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning investors that its earnings will miss expectations. Saying the lingering cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items. Investors are now wondering if Walmart's sales have been equally impacted.</p><p>(voice-over): But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from Walmart's consumer research. Every quarter, the company surveys its shoppers to take the pulse of what's concerning them most. Last quarter, Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p>Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren't worried.</p><p>KNIFFEN: I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has ever run since I started watching them in 1968. They are doing a fabulous job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p>REAGAN: And the stockholders are reaping the benefits. Walmart shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one company to watch this earnings season.</p><p>GHARIB: So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers, move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save money. But things have changed. Rising costs for labor, material and shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those jobs back home.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Here in Shanghai, U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new challenge, rising costs. In fact, a new study out today finds that the total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the U.S. by 2015.</p><p>For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in Shanghai are rising faster than expected. For example, labor wages are jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain skilled workers. They've got 110 employees here in China, making components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Honeywell. And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually move out of Shanghai.</p><p>MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO: We're looking at different areas in China. Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area. But in the next five to seven years, I would say we'll definitely be somewhere further inland.</p><p>LEBEAU: Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in China compared to India, Mexico and the United States. Meanwhile, China's currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10 years.</p><p>Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years. Now, analysts believe the cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the U.S. within a couple of years.</p><p>STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: If you go back to 2005, it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30 percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States. Based on our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been closed.</p><p>LEBEAU: The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers, will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.?</p><p>Well, don't expect a huge rush of re-shoring. There may be a few companies to bring jobs back. What's more likely is they will keep their China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S. plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p>One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in China, productivity. Now, it's improving here in China, but it's still not to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S. manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative to firms here in China.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we'll look at whether China, the world's largest auto market, is about to become the world's most lucrative market for luxury carmakers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p>First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies fared today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: You can call it a whale of a deal. SeaWorld Entertainment -- this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange. It's offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27 each, raising $702 million.</p><p>Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash.</p><p>The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt and grow its business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY: I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can't see that stuff in Kansas.</p><p>WELLS: SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and the new owners return it had to profitability. The recession put the business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45 million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p>Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego.</p><p>TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE: SeaWorld is one of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): But there are risks. The company says it has nearly $1.7 billion in debt. And when your entire business model is built around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p>(voice-over): The company is appealing federal safety violations after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago. SeaWorld warns it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses to keep animals.</p><p>But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from other theme park companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so much, so I can't wait for my son to have that in his life as well.</p><p>WELLS: Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up under water.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we'll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And, Bill, I understand that he's bringing a penguin to help him ring the opening bell tomorrow morning.</p><p>GRIFFETH: One of the best-dressed bell ringers they've had at the New York Stock Exchange in quite a while. It's a great family story, but can they continue to grow this franchise? It's pretty long in the tooth.</p><p>GHARIB: I'll ask him. We'll find out.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Exactly.</p><p>GHARIB: I'll report back tomorrow.</p><p>And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

A big  night for technology as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM report earnings.  We'll look at the winners and the losers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Stocks slide again.   Mixed earnings and a batch of economic numbers that missed projections drag  down the major indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  China's cheap labor -- well, at least that was the case.   But as costs rise, are some U.S. manufacturers thinking about pulling out?</p><p>All that and more tonight on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, April the 18th. </p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Bill Griffeth, in this week  for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>And, Susie, it's clear.  Once again, that technology is going to set  the tone for tomorrow, don't you think? </p><p>GHARIB:  Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM.  Three huge technology  companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell  tonight with mixed results.</p><p>The results are important given new concerns about slowing global  economic growth.  And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers  this year.  The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading  as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech  suppliers and component makers on Friday. </p><p>And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors  will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this  evening, and that's where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Susie, a big day  for tech.  Let's run through the numbers. </p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and  personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are  out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line.  CEO Steve  Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off.  The  tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company  at the end of the year.  It will name its new CFO in the next several  weeks.</p><p>Let's also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Shares are up after hours.   The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of  $10.66.  However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly  shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p>And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many  times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader  technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due  to a decline in hardware and services sales.  Its first quarter EPS came in  at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p>The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM's  one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the  S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time.   And if that's the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p>We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p>Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Seema, thank you very much. </p><p>And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks  it's headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group. </p><p>Welcome back. </p><p>ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All three that reported tonight missed on the top line.   They were light on revenue.  Does that worry you? </p><p>KUMAR:  No, I think these are cyclical trends.  In near term, I think  the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is  weak across the developed markets.  And they're seeing customers slow down  across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p>And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy  among the large corporate accounts.  So, it's more cyclical in nature than  secular. </p><p>GHARIB:  You know, this has been a tough time for technology  companies, technology earnings.  And there are so many changes happening in  the technology space.  And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once,  you know, the darling of the tech sector. </p><p>Now it's, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak.  What is  it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus  an also-ran?</p><p>KUMAR:  Absolutely.  I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  story, I think the company's meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100  to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in  terms of price and unit.  So the company came in and dominated the tablet  market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone  segment.</p><p>And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of  course, it's on the other side of that mountain, so to speak.  So, over  $200 billion of market cap has been removed.  And so the company is looking  forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing  transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or  the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the  mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should  benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We keep hearing the migration to mobile.  We all have  tablets.  We all have smartphones.</p><p>What about the PC?  Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the  personal computer right now? </p><p>KUMAR:  I think it's become -- Bill, it's become primarily a  replacement in a market.  In other words, the life cycle of the PC  continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications  that are being written for the PC platform.  So the go-to platform or the  post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and  that's where the application developer community is focused on. </p><p>GHARIB:  You see a wide range of technology companies.  Let me just  get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think  have the platforms that are on the cutting edge.  And maybe not any of the  companies that we've been talking about tonight that reported earnings. </p><p>KUMAR:  Absolutely.  That's a very good point because it seems that  investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and  disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a  company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and  moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard  (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And what about an IBM?  I mean, so influential for years.   They've made this transition through the services industry.  They were  cutting edge on that.  What did you think of their earnings, and where do  you think they're going from here? </p><p>KUMAR:  Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM.  I think they were  early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and  services in the '90s.  So the company's portfolio, if you look at it in a  longer-term perspective, it's very counter-cyclical.  So they're able to  write the software and services, they're in a position to grow, you know,  the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p>So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the  near-term performance.  But from a longer-term perspective, they're very  well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p>GHARIB:  So, this has been a big week for technology earnings.  A lot  of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on  trading tomorrow.  Do you think that this latest batch is going to  influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way? </p><p>KUMAR:  No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes.  But longer term, I think technology sector creates a  tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments.  It's global in  theme, it's secular in themes.  So, I think these are cyclical factors that  are impacting performance.</p><p>But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very  compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you.  Thank you  for joining us. </p><p>KUMAR:  Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB:  On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile  trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the  major averages lower. </p><p>The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4  percent more.  We'll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\".  And the  NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about,  closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p>Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ  lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p>Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000  last week.  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in  the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month.  And the read on leading  economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first  time in four months. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this  year.  And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation  (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.  </p><p>The country's largest auto dealership owner reported that first  quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with  revenues that topped $4 billion.  Sales of new and used cars were higher  last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even  announced plans to expand.</p><p>GHARIB:  AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now. </p><p>Mike, nice to see you again. </p><p>I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say  now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p>MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION:  Well, Susie, you have to look at it  within the context in the auto industry.  We had a depression, a complete  crash, a complete breakdown in '08, '09, '10.  We could not get financing  for our customers.  So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p>And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in  America to 11 years old.  It's unprecedented.  And people really need to do  something at this point.  The trades we're looking at have 150,000 miles on  it.  So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and  now there's genuine replacement need.</p><p>So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering  ever, outstanding quality.  And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>JACKSON:  -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel  economy.  We don't ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don't  have to buy exotic hybrids or electric.  Mainstream technology will give  you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p>And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during  the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>JACKSON:  We were the first payment-to-household made.  So the banks  have really moved back into financing cars. </p><p>So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural  support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive  recovery.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It's clear to see why you're a superstar salesman, Mike. </p><p>One of the trends we've seen in the recovery has been the tremendous  strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market.  Is  that still the case?  Are people tending to buy more used cars than they  did in the past?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, the used car story is the following.  We are selling  big improvements in used cars and new cars.  And because there's such a  shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low  from '08, '09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the  value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p>So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other  drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give  you more money for your trade than you're ever going to get.  And they say,  great, I'm ready to get something newer, whether it's still used or new.</p><p>GHARIB:  Let me ask you this, Mike.  I know you hear this all the  time.  Everybody's talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest  rates and talking about at some point they're going to go up.  When  interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in  buying a car and to finance it?</p><p>JACKSON:  No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows  that it will not continue.  I should be clear, the market rate that  customers are paying today, let's say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you  talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a  manufacturer.  So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on  the financing of an automobile.  So I don't think the normalization of  interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I've  called out that are driving this recovery.  We're in the early innings of  this automotive recovery.  We're on a journey back to the industry, selling  16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p>GHARIB:  So, that's nice to end on an upbeat note. </p><p>Thank you, Mike.  So good to see you.  Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation  (NYSE:AN). </p><p>JACKSON:  Good to see you.</p><p>GHARIB:  And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the  program, we'll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when  that sector reports. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>But it wasn't all positive.  The company also said first quarter  profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare  services.  The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the  rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p>United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed  by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint,  all down at least 2 percent at the close. </p><p>GHARIB:  Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits  thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter.  Shares hit a new all-time  high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent. </p><p>PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price  increases helped boost profit margins.  Revenues in its snack business  improved as well, particularly in China.  Pepsi gained more than 3 percent,  closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall  Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock  trading volume.  But investors did focus on weakness in the company's bond  trading unit.  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than  5 percent on the day. </p><p>And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported  significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis.  And that sent  shares soaring after hours.  Vertex's two drug therapy improved patients'  lung function in a phase 2 study.  Now, shares had closed down at the end  of the session.  But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50  percent in after-hours trade.</p><p>GHARIB:  And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in  profits, and that's thanks to stronger sales.  And said it expects to open  as many as 180 new locations this year.  The company restated its guidance  of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close  gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading. </p><p>And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many  American companies looking for cheap labor.  But that could be all about to  change.</p><p>First, let's take a look at how the international markets finished the  day. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more  money shopping than at Walmart. </p><p>As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how  important Walmart's results are to investors and what they might reveal  about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season,  the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of  the consumer amid continued uncertainty.  And for decades running, it's the  earnings released from the world's largest retailer that is perhaps the  most anticipated. </p><p>JAN KNIFFEN:  Walmart is the bellwether.  And other than the time  period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has  always been the bellwether. </p><p>REAGAN:  A bellwether for good reason.  Every week, more than 200  million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around  the world.  For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of  more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch.  It  measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a  year.  While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five  quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p>(on camera):  Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning  investors that its earnings will miss expectations.  Saying the lingering  cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items.  Investors are now wondering if Walmart's sales have been  equally impacted.</p><p>(voice-over):  But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from  Walmart's consumer research.  Every quarter, the company surveys its  shoppers to take the pulse of what's concerning them most.  Last quarter,  Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs  followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p>Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren't worried. </p><p>KNIFFEN:  I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has  ever run since I started watching them in 1968.  They are doing a fabulous  job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p>REAGAN:  And the stockholders are reaping the benefits.  Walmart  shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail  index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one  company to watch this earnings season. </p><p>GHARIB:  So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers,  move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save  money.  But things have changed.  Rising costs for labor, material and  shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those  jobs back home.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Here in Shanghai,  U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new  challenge, rising costs.  In fact, a new study out today finds that the  total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the  U.S. by 2015.</p><p>For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in  Shanghai are rising faster than expected.  For example, labor wages are  jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain  skilled workers.  They've got 110 employees here in China, making  components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and  Honeywell.  And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually  move out of Shanghai.</p><p>MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO:  We're looking at different areas  in China.  Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where  we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area.  But in  the next five to seven years, I would say we'll definitely be somewhere  further inland.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in  China compared to India, Mexico and the United States.  Meanwhile, China's  currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10  years.</p><p>Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing  in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years.  Now, analysts believe the  cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the  U.S. within a couple of years. </p><p>STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  If you go back to 2005,  it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30  percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States.  Based on  our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been  closed. </p><p>LEBEAU:  The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers,  will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.? </p><p>Well, don't expect a huge rush of re-shoring.  There may be a few  companies to bring jobs back.  What's more likely is they will keep their  China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S.  plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p>One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in  China, productivity.  Now, it's improving here in China, but it's still not  to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S.  manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative  to firms here in China. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And tomorrow, we'll look at whether China, the world's  largest auto market, is about to become the world's most lucrative market  for luxury carmakers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its  trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p>First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies  fared today. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  You can call it a whale of a deal.  SeaWorld Entertainment --  this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell  shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock  Exchange.  It's offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27  each, raising $702 million. </p><p>Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash. </p><p>The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and  Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt  and grow its business. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can't see that stuff in Kansas. </p><p>WELLS:  SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and  the new owners return it had to profitability.  The recession put the  business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45  million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p>Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to  attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego. </p><p>TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE:  SeaWorld is one  of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p>WELLS (on camera):  But there are risks.  The company says it has  nearly $1.7 billion in debt.  And when your entire business model is built  around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p>(voice-over):  The company is appealing federal safety violations  after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago.  SeaWorld warns  it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses  to keep animals. </p><p>But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from  other theme park companies. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so  much, so I can't wait for my son to have that in his life as well. </p><p>WELLS:  Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is  a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up  under water.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And tomorrow, we'll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim  Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>And, Bill, I understand that he's bringing a penguin to help him ring  the opening bell tomorrow morning. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  One of the best-dressed bell ringers they've had at the New  York Stock Exchange in quite a while.  It's a great family story, but can  they continue to grow this franchise?  It's pretty long in the tooth. </p><p>GHARIB:  I'll ask him.  We'll find out. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Exactly.</p><p>GHARIB:  I'll report back tomorrow. </p><p>And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.   Thanks so much for watching. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We will see you  again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

A big night for technology as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM report earnings. We`ll look at the winners and the losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Stocks slide again. Mixed earnings and a batch of economic numbers that missed projections drag down the major indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: China`s cheap labor -- well, at least that was the case. But as costs rise, are some U.S. manufacturers thinking about pulling out?</p><p>All that and more tonight on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, April the 18th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. I`m Bill Griffeth, in this week for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>And, Susie, it`s clear. Once again, that technology is going to set the tone for tomorrow, don`t you think?</p><p>GHARIB: Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM. Three huge technology companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell tonight with mixed results.</p><p>The results are important given new concerns about slowing global economic growth. And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers this year. The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech suppliers and component makers on Friday.</p><p>And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this evening, and that`s where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Susie, a big day for tech. Let`s run through the numbers.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line. CEO Steve Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off. The tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company at the end of the year. It will name its new CFO in the next several weeks.</p><p>Let`s also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Shares are up after hours. The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of $10.66. However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p>And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due to a decline in hardware and services sales. Its first quarter EPS came in at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p>The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM`s one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time. And if that`s the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p>We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p>Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks it`s headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group.</p><p>Welcome back.</p><p>ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All three that reported tonight missed on the top line. They were light on revenue. Does that worry you?</p><p>KUMAR: No, I think these are cyclical trends. In near term, I think the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is weak across the developed markets. And they`re seeing customers slow down across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p>And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy among the large corporate accounts. So, it`s more cyclical in nature than secular.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, this has been a tough time for technology companies, technology earnings. And there are so many changes happening in the technology space. And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once, you know, the darling of the tech sector.</p><p>Now it`s, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak. What is it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus an also-ran?</p><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) story, I think the company`s meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100 to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in terms of price and unit. So the company came in and dominated the tablet market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone segment.</p><p>And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of course, it`s on the other side of that mountain, so to speak. So, over $200 billion of market cap has been removed. And so the company is looking forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We keep hearing the migration to mobile. We all have tablets. We all have smartphones.</p><p>What about the PC? Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the personal computer right now?</p><p>KUMAR: I think it`s become -- Bill, it`s become primarily a replacement in a market. In other words, the life cycle of the PC continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications that are being written for the PC platform. So the go-to platform or the post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and that`s where the application developer community is focused on.</p><p>GHARIB: You see a wide range of technology companies. Let me just get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think have the platforms that are on the cutting edge. And maybe not any of the companies that we`ve been talking about tonight that reported earnings.</p><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. That`s a very good point because it seems that investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what about an IBM? I mean, so influential for years. They`ve made this transition through the services industry. They were cutting edge on that. What did you think of their earnings, and where do you think they`re going from here?</p><p>KUMAR: Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM. I think they were early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and services in the `90s. So the company`s portfolio, if you look at it in a longer-term perspective, it`s very counter-cyclical. So they`re able to write the software and services, they`re in a position to grow, you know, the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p>So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the near-term performance. But from a longer-term perspective, they`re very well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p>GHARIB: So, this has been a big week for technology earnings. A lot of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on trading tomorrow. Do you think that this latest batch is going to influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way?</p><p>KUMAR: No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes. But longer term, I think technology sector creates a tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments. It`s global in theme, it`s secular in themes. So, I think these are cyclical factors that are impacting performance.</p><p>But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>KUMAR: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the major averages lower.</p><p>The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4 percent more. We`ll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\". And the NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about, closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p>Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p>Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000 last week. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month. And the read on leading economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first time in four months.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this year. And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.</p><p>The country`s largest auto dealership owner reported that first quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with revenues that topped $4 billion. Sales of new and used cars were higher last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even announced plans to expand.</p><p>GHARIB: AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now.</p><p>Mike, nice to see you again.</p><p>I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p>MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION: Well, Susie, you have to look at it within the context in the auto industry. We had a depression, a complete crash, a complete breakdown in `08, `09, `10. We could not get financing for our customers. So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p>And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in America to 11 years old. It`s unprecedented. And people really need to do something at this point. The trades we`re looking at have 150,000 miles on it. So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and now there`s genuine replacement need.</p><p>So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering ever, outstanding quality. And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>JACKSON: -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel economy. We don`t ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don`t have to buy exotic hybrids or electric. Mainstream technology will give you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p>And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>JACKSON: We were the first payment-to-household made. So the banks have really moved back into financing cars.</p><p>So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive recovery.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It`s clear to see why you`re a superstar salesman, Mike.</p><p>One of the trends we`ve seen in the recovery has been the tremendous strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market. Is that still the case? Are people tending to buy more used cars than they did in the past?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, the used car story is the following. We are selling big improvements in used cars and new cars. And because there`s such a shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low from `08, `09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p>So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give you more money for your trade than you`re ever going to get. And they say, great, I`m ready to get something newer, whether it`s still used or new.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me ask you this, Mike. I know you hear this all the time. Everybody`s talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest rates and talking about at some point they`re going to go up. When interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in buying a car and to finance it?</p><p>JACKSON: No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows that it will not continue. I should be clear, the market rate that customers are paying today, let`s say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a manufacturer. So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on the financing of an automobile. So I don`t think the normalization of interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I`ve called out that are driving this recovery. We`re in the early innings of this automotive recovery. We`re on a journey back to the industry, selling 16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p>GHARIB: So, that`s nice to end on an upbeat note.</p><p>Thank you, Mike. So good to see you. Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation (NYSE:AN).</p><p>JACKSON: Good to see you.</p><p>GHARIB: And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the program, we`ll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when that sector reports.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>But it wasn`t all positive. The company also said first quarter profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare services. The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p>United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint, all down at least 2 percent at the close.</p><p>GHARIB: Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter. Shares hit a new all-time high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent.</p><p>PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price increases helped boost profit margins. Revenues in its snack business improved as well, particularly in China. Pepsi gained more than 3 percent, closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock trading volume. But investors did focus on weakness in the company`s bond trading unit. Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than 5 percent on the day.</p><p>And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis. And that sent shares soaring after hours. Vertex`s two drug therapy improved patients` lung function in a phase 2 study. Now, shares had closed down at the end of the session. But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50 percent in after-hours trade.</p><p>GHARIB: And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in profits, and that`s thanks to stronger sales. And said it expects to open as many as 180 new locations this year. The company restated its guidance of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many American companies looking for cheap labor. But that could be all about to change.</p><p>First, let`s take a look at how the international markets finished the day.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more money shopping than at Walmart.</p><p>As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how important Walmart`s results are to investors and what they might reveal about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season, the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of the consumer amid continued uncertainty. And for decades running, it`s the earnings released from the world`s largest retailer that is perhaps the most anticipated.</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN: Walmart is the bellwether. And other than the time period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has always been the bellwether.</p><p>REAGAN: A bellwether for good reason. Every week, more than 200 million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around the world. For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p>Walmart`s U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch. It measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a year. While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p>(on camera): Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning investors that its earnings will miss expectations. Saying the lingering cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items. Investors are now wondering if Walmart`s sales have been equally impacted.</p><p>(voice-over): But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from Walmart`s consumer research. Every quarter, the company surveys its shoppers to take the pulse of what`s concerning them most. Last quarter, Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p>Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren`t worried.</p><p>KNIFFEN: I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has ever run since I started watching them in 1968. They are doing a fabulous job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p>REAGAN: And the stockholders are reaping the benefits. Walmart shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one company to watch this earnings season.</p><p>GHARIB: So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers, move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save money. But things have changed. Rising costs for labor, material and shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those jobs back home.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Here in Shanghai, U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new challenge, rising costs. In fact, a new study out today finds that the total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the U.S. by 2015.</p><p>For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in Shanghai are rising faster than expected. For example, labor wages are jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain skilled workers. They`ve got 110 employees here in China, making components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Honeywell. And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually move out of Shanghai.</p><p>MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO: We`re looking at different areas in China. Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area. But in the next five to seven years, I would say we`ll definitely be somewhere further inland.</p><p>LEBEAU: Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in China compared to India, Mexico and the United States. Meanwhile, China`s currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10 years.</p><p>Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years. Now, analysts believe the cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the U.S. within a couple of years.</p><p>STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: If you go back to 2005, it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30 percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States. Based on our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been closed.</p><p>LEBEAU: The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers, will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.?</p><p>Well, don`t expect a huge rush of re-shoring. There may be a few companies to bring jobs back. What`s more likely is they will keep their China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S. plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p>One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in China, productivity. Now, it`s improving here in China, but it`s still not to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S. manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative to firms here in China.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we`ll look at whether China, the world`s largest auto market, is about to become the world`s most lucrative market for luxury carmakers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p>First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies fared today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: You can call it a whale of a deal. SeaWorld Entertainment -- this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange. It`s offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27 each, raising $702 million.</p><p>Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash.</p><p>The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt and grow its business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY: I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can`t see that stuff in Kansas.</p><p>WELLS: SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and the new owners return it had to profitability. The recession put the business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45 million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p>Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego.</p><p>TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE: SeaWorld is one of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): But there are risks. The company says it has nearly $1.7 billion in debt. And when your entire business model is built around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p>(voice-over): The company is appealing federal safety violations after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago. SeaWorld warns it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses to keep animals.</p><p>But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from other theme park companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so much, so I can`t wait for my son to have that in his life as well.</p><p>WELLS: Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up under water.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we`ll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And, Bill, I understand that he`s bringing a penguin to help him ring the opening bell tomorrow morning.</p><p>GRIFFETH: One of the best-dressed bell ringers they`ve had at the New York Stock Exchange in quite a while. It`s a great family story, but can they continue to grow this franchise? It`s pretty long in the tooth.</p><p>GHARIB: I`ll ask him. We`ll find out.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Exactly.</p><p>GHARIB: I`ll report back tomorrow.</p><p>And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

Once again, that technology is going to set  the tone for tomorrow, don't you think? </p><p>  GHARIB:  Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM.  Three huge technology  companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell  tonight with mixed results.</p><p>  The results are important given new concerns about slowing global  economic growth.  And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers  this year.  The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading  as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech  suppliers and component makers on Friday. </p><p>  And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors  will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p>  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this  evening, and that's where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p>  SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Susie, a big day  for tech.  Let's run through the numbers. </p><p>  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and  personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are  out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line.  CEO Steve  Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off.  The  tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company  at the end of the year.  It will name its new CFO in the next several  weeks.</p><p>  Let's also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Shares are up after hours.   The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of  $10.66.  However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly  shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p>  And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many  times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader  technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due  to a decline in hardware and services sales.  Its first quarter EPS came in  at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p>  The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM's  one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the  S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time.   And if that's the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p>  We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p>  Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Seema, thank you very much. </p><p>  And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks  it's headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group. </p><p>  Welcome back. </p><p>  ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  All three that reported tonight missed on the top line.   They were light on revenue.  Does that worry you? </p><p>  KUMAR:  No, I think these are cyclical trends.  In near term, I think  the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is  weak across the developed markets.  And they're seeing customers slow down  across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p>  And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy  among the large corporate accounts.  So, it's more cyclical in nature than  secular. </p><p>  GHARIB:  You know, this has been a tough time for technology  companies, technology earnings.  And there are so many changes happening in  the technology space.  And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once,  you know, the darling of the tech sector. </p><p>  Now it's, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak.  What is  it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus  an also-ran?</p><p>  KUMAR:  Absolutely.  I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  story, I think the company's meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100  to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in  terms of price and unit.  So the company came in and dominated the tablet  market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone  segment.</p><p>  And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of  course, it's on the other side of that mountain, so to speak.  So, over  $200 billion of market cap has been removed.  And so the company is looking  forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing  transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or  the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the  mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should  benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  We keep hearing the migration to mobile.  We all have  tablets.  We all have smartphones.</p><p>  What about the PC?  Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the  personal computer right now? </p><p>  KUMAR:  I think it's become -- Bill, it's become primarily a  replacement in a market.  In other words, the life cycle of the PC  continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications  that are being written for the PC platform.  So the go-to platform or the  post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and  that's where the application developer community is focused on. </p><p>  GHARIB:  You see a wide range of technology companies.  Let me just  get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think  have the platforms that are on the cutting edge.  And maybe not any of the  companies that we've been talking about tonight that reported earnings. </p><p>  KUMAR:  Absolutely.  That's a very good point because it seems that  investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and  disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a  company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and  moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard  (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And what about an IBM?  I mean, so influential for years.   They've made this transition through the services industry.  They were  cutting edge on that.  What did you think of their earnings, and where do  you think they're going from here? </p><p>  KUMAR:  Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM.  I think they were  early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and  services in the '90s.  So the company's portfolio, if you look at it in a  longer-term perspective, it's very counter-cyclical.  So they're able to  write the software and services, they're in a position to grow, you know,  the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p>  So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the  near-term performance.  But from a longer-term perspective, they're very  well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p>  GHARIB:  So, this has been a big week for technology earnings.  A lot  of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on  trading tomorrow.  Do you think that this latest batch is going to  influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way? </p><p>  KUMAR:  No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes.  But longer term, I think technology sector creates a  tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments.  It's global in  theme, it's secular in themes.  So, I think these are cyclical factors that  are impacting performance.</p><p>  But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very  compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you.  Thank you  for joining us. </p><p>  KUMAR:  Thank you.</p><p>  GHARIB:  On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile  trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the  major averages lower. </p><p>  The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4  percent more.  We'll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\".  And the  NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about,  closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p>  Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ  lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p>  Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000  last week.  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in  the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month.  And the read on leading  economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first  time in four months. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this  year.  And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation  (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.  </p><p>  The country's largest auto dealership owner reported that first  quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with  revenues that topped $4 billion.  Sales of new and used cars were higher  last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even  announced plans to expand.</p><p>  GHARIB:  AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now. </p><p>  Mike, nice to see you again. </p><p>  I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say  now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p>  MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION:  Well, Susie, you have to look at it  within the context in the auto industry.  We had a depression, a complete  crash, a complete breakdown in '08, '09, '10.  We could not get financing  for our customers.  So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p>  And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in  America to 11 years old.  It's unprecedented.  And people really need to do  something at this point.  The trades we're looking at have 150,000 miles on  it.  So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and  now there's genuine replacement need.</p><p>  So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering  ever, outstanding quality.  And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>  JACKSON:  -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel  economy.  We don't ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don't  have to buy exotic hybrids or electric.  Mainstream technology will give  you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p>  And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during  the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>  JACKSON:  We were the first payment-to-household made.  So the banks  have really moved back into financing cars. </p><p>  So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural  support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive  recovery.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  It's clear to see why you're a superstar salesman, Mike. </p><p>  One of the trends we've seen in the recovery has been the tremendous  strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market.  Is  that still the case?  Are people tending to buy more used cars than they  did in the past?</p><p>  JACKSON:  Well, the used car story is the following.  We are selling  big improvements in used cars and new cars.  And because there's such a  shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low  from '08, '09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the  value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p>  So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other  drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give  you more money for your trade than you're ever going to get.  And they say,  great, I'm ready to get something newer, whether it's still used or new.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Let me ask you this, Mike.  I know you hear this all the  time.  Everybody's talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest  rates and talking about at some point they're going to go up.  When  interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in  buying a car and to finance it?</p><p>  JACKSON:  No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows  that it will not continue.  I should be clear, the market rate that  customers are paying today, let's say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you  talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a  manufacturer.  So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>  But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on  the financing of an automobile.  So I don't think the normalization of  interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I've  called out that are driving this recovery.  We're in the early innings of  this automotive recovery.  We're on a journey back to the industry, selling  16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p>  GHARIB:  So, that's nice to end on an upbeat note. </p><p>  Thank you, Mike.  So good to see you.  Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation  (NYSE:AN). </p><p>  JACKSON:  Good to see you.</p><p>  GHARIB:  And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the  program, we'll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when  that sector reports. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>  But it wasn't all positive.  The company also said first quarter  profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare  services.  The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the  rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p>  United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed  by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint,  all down at least 2 percent at the close. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits  thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter.  Shares hit a new all-time  high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent. </p><p>  PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price  increases helped boost profit margins.  Revenues in its snack business  improved as well, particularly in China.  Pepsi gained more than 3 percent,  closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall  Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock  trading volume.  But investors did focus on weakness in the company's bond  trading unit.  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than  5 percent on the day. </p><p>  And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported  significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis.  And that sent  shares soaring after hours.  Vertex's two drug therapy improved patients'  lung function in a phase 2 study.  Now, shares had closed down at the end  of the session.  But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50  percent in after-hours trade.</p><p>  GHARIB:  And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in  profits, and that's thanks to stronger sales.  And said it expects to open  as many as 180 new locations this year.  The company restated its guidance  of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>  Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close  gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading. </p><p>  And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many  American companies looking for cheap labor.  But that could be all about to  change.</p><p>  First, let's take a look at how the international markets finished the  day. </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more  money shopping than at Walmart. </p><p>  As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how  important Walmart's results are to investors and what they might reveal  about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season,  the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of  the consumer amid continued uncertainty.  And for decades running, it's the  earnings released from the world's largest retailer that is perhaps the  most anticipated. </p><p>  JAN KNIFFEN:  Walmart is the bellwether.  And other than the time  period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has  always been the bellwether. </p><p>  REAGAN:  A bellwether for good reason.  Every week, more than 200  million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around  the world.  For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of  more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch.  It  measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a  year.  While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five  quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p>  (on camera):  Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning  investors that its earnings will miss expectations.  Saying the lingering  cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items.  Investors are now wondering if Walmart's sales have been  equally impacted.</p><p>  (voice-over):  But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from  Walmart's consumer research.  Every quarter, the company surveys its  shoppers to take the pulse of what's concerning them most.  Last quarter,  Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs  followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p>  Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren't worried. </p><p>  KNIFFEN:  I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has  ever run since I started watching them in 1968.  They are doing a fabulous  job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p>  REAGAN:  And the stockholders are reaping the benefits.  Walmart  shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail  index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one  company to watch this earnings season. </p><p>  GHARIB:  So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers,  move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save  money.  But things have changed.  Rising costs for labor, material and  shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those  jobs back home.</p><p>  Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Here in Shanghai,  U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new  challenge, rising costs.  In fact, a new study out today finds that the  total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the  U.S. by 2015.</p><p>  For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in  Shanghai are rising faster than expected.  For example, labor wages are  jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain  skilled workers.  They've got 110 employees here in China, making  components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and  Honeywell.  And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually  move out of Shanghai.</p><p>  MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO:  We're looking at different areas  in China.  Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where  we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area.  But in  the next five to seven years, I would say we'll definitely be somewhere  further inland.</p><p>  LEBEAU:  Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in  China compared to India, Mexico and the United States.  Meanwhile, China's  currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10  years.</p><p>  Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing  in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years.  Now, analysts believe the  cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the  U.S. within a couple of years. </p><p>  STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  If you go back to 2005,  it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30  percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States.  Based on  our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been  closed. </p><p>  LEBEAU:  The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers,  will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.? </p><p>  Well, don't expect a huge rush of re-shoring.  There may be a few  companies to bring jobs back.  What's more likely is they will keep their  China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S.  plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p>  One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in  China, productivity.  Now, it's improving here in China, but it's still not  to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S.  manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative  to firms here in China. </p><p>  Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  And tomorrow, we'll look at whether China, the world's  largest auto market, is about to become the world's most lucrative market  for luxury carmakers.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its  trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p>  First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies  fared today. </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  You can call it a whale of a deal.  SeaWorld Entertainment --  this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell  shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock  Exchange.  It's offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27  each, raising $702 million. </p><p>  Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash. </p><p>  The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and  Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt  and grow its business. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can't see that stuff in Kansas. </p><p>  WELLS:  SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and  the new owners return it had to profitability.  The recession put the  business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45  million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p>  Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to  attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego. </p><p>  TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE:  SeaWorld is one  of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p>  WELLS (on camera):  But there are risks.  The company says it has  nearly $1.7 billion in debt.  And when your entire business model is built  around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p>  (voice-over):  The company is appealing federal safety violations  after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago.  SeaWorld warns  it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses  to keep animals. </p><p>  But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from  other theme park companies. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so  much, so I can't wait for my son to have that in his life as well. </p><p>  WELLS:  Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is  a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up  under water.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  And tomorrow, we'll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim  Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>  And, Bill, I understand that he's bringing a penguin to help him ring  the opening bell tomorrow morning. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  One of the best-dressed bell ringers they've had at the New  York Stock Exchange in quite a while.  It's a great family story, but can  they continue to grow this franchise?  It's pretty long in the tooth. </p><p>  GHARIB:  I'll ask him.  We'll find out. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Exactly.</p><p>  GHARIB:  I'll report back tomorrow. </p><p>  And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.   Thanks so much for watching. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We will see you  again tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

A big  night for technology as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM report earnings.  We'll look at the winners and the losers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Stocks slide again.   Mixed earnings and a batch of economic numbers that missed projections drag  down the major indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  China's cheap labor -- well, at least that was the case.   But as costs rise, are some U.S. manufacturers thinking about pulling out?</p><p>All that and more tonight on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, April the 18th. </p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Bill Griffeth, in this week  for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>And, Susie, it's clear.  Once again, that technology is going to set  the tone for tomorrow, don't you think? </p><p>GHARIB:  Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM.  Three huge technology  companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell  tonight with mixed results.</p><p>The results are important given new concerns about slowing global  economic growth.  And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers  this year.  The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading  as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech  suppliers and component makers on Friday. </p><p>And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors  will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this  evening, and that's where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Susie, a big day  for tech.  Let's run through the numbers. </p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and  personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are  out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line.  CEO Steve  Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off.  The  tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company  at the end of the year.  It will name its new CFO in the next several  weeks.</p><p>Let's also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Shares are up after hours.   The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of  $10.66.  However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly  shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p>And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many  times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader  technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due  to a decline in hardware and services sales.  Its first quarter EPS came in  at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p>The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM's  one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the  S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time.   And if that's the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p>We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p>Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Seema, thank you very much. </p><p>And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks  it's headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group. </p><p>Welcome back. </p><p>ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All three that reported tonight missed on the top line.   They were light on revenue.  Does that worry you? </p><p>KUMAR:  No, I think these are cyclical trends.  In near term, I think  the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is  weak across the developed markets.  And they're seeing customers slow down  across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p>And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy  among the large corporate accounts.  So, it's more cyclical in nature than  secular. </p><p>GHARIB:  You know, this has been a tough time for technology  companies, technology earnings.  And there are so many changes happening in  the technology space.  And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once,  you know, the darling of the tech sector. </p><p>Now it's, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak.  What is  it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus  an also-ran?</p><p>KUMAR:  Absolutely.  I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  story, I think the company's meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100  to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in  terms of price and unit.  So the company came in and dominated the tablet  market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone  segment.</p><p>And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of  course, it's on the other side of that mountain, so to speak.  So, over  $200 billion of market cap has been removed.  And so the company is looking  forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing  transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or  the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the  mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should  benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We keep hearing the migration to mobile.  We all have  tablets.  We all have smartphones.</p><p>What about the PC?  Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the  personal computer right now? </p><p>KUMAR:  I think it's become -- Bill, it's become primarily a  replacement in a market.  In other words, the life cycle of the PC  continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications  that are being written for the PC platform.  So the go-to platform or the  post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and  that's where the application developer community is focused on. </p><p>GHARIB:  You see a wide range of technology companies.  Let me just  get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think  have the platforms that are on the cutting edge.  And maybe not any of the  companies that we've been talking about tonight that reported earnings. </p><p>KUMAR:  Absolutely.  That's a very good point because it seems that  investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and  disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a  company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and  moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard  (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And what about an IBM?  I mean, so influential for years.   They've made this transition through the services industry.  They were  cutting edge on that.  What did you think of their earnings, and where do  you think they're going from here? </p><p>KUMAR:  Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM.  I think they were  early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and  services in the '90s.  So the company's portfolio, if you look at it in a  longer-term perspective, it's very counter-cyclical.  So they're able to  write the software and services, they're in a position to grow, you know,  the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p>So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the  near-term performance.  But from a longer-term perspective, they're very  well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p>GHARIB:  So, this has been a big week for technology earnings.  A lot  of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on  trading tomorrow.  Do you think that this latest batch is going to  influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way? </p><p>KUMAR:  No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes.  But longer term, I think technology sector creates a  tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments.  It's global in  theme, it's secular in themes.  So, I think these are cyclical factors that  are impacting performance.</p><p>But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very  compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you.  Thank you  for joining us. </p><p>KUMAR:  Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB:  On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile  trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the  major averages lower. </p><p>The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4  percent more.  We'll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\".  And the  NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about,  closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p>Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ  lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p>Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000  last week.  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in  the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month.  And the read on leading  economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first  time in four months. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this  year.  And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation  (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.  </p><p>The country's largest auto dealership owner reported that first  quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with  revenues that topped $4 billion.  Sales of new and used cars were higher  last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even  announced plans to expand.</p><p>GHARIB:  AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now. </p><p>Mike, nice to see you again. </p><p>I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say  now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p>MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION:  Well, Susie, you have to look at it  within the context in the auto industry.  We had a depression, a complete  crash, a complete breakdown in '08, '09, '10.  We could not get financing  for our customers.  So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p>And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in  America to 11 years old.  It's unprecedented.  And people really need to do  something at this point.  The trades we're looking at have 150,000 miles on  it.  So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and  now there's genuine replacement need.</p><p>So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering  ever, outstanding quality.  And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>JACKSON:  -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel  economy.  We don't ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don't  have to buy exotic hybrids or electric.  Mainstream technology will give  you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p>And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during  the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>JACKSON:  We were the first payment-to-household made.  So the banks  have really moved back into financing cars. </p><p>So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural  support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive  recovery.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It's clear to see why you're a superstar salesman, Mike. </p><p>One of the trends we've seen in the recovery has been the tremendous  strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market.  Is  that still the case?  Are people tending to buy more used cars than they  did in the past?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, the used car story is the following.  We are selling  big improvements in used cars and new cars.  And because there's such a  shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low  from '08, '09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the  value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p>So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other  drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give  you more money for your trade than you're ever going to get.  And they say,  great, I'm ready to get something newer, whether it's still used or new.</p><p>GHARIB:  Let me ask you this, Mike.  I know you hear this all the  time.  Everybody's talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest  rates and talking about at some point they're going to go up.  When  interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in  buying a car and to finance it?</p><p>JACKSON:  No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows  that it will not continue.  I should be clear, the market rate that  customers are paying today, let's say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you  talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a  manufacturer.  So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on  the financing of an automobile.  So I don't think the normalization of  interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I've  called out that are driving this recovery.  We're in the early innings of  this automotive recovery.  We're on a journey back to the industry, selling  16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p>GHARIB:  So, that's nice to end on an upbeat note. </p><p>Thank you, Mike.  So good to see you.  Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation  (NYSE:AN). </p><p>JACKSON:  Good to see you.</p><p>GHARIB:  And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the  program, we'll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when  that sector reports. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>But it wasn't all positive.  The company also said first quarter  profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare  services.  The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the  rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p>United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed  by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint,  all down at least 2 percent at the close. </p><p>GHARIB:  Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits  thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter.  Shares hit a new all-time  high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent. </p><p>PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price  increases helped boost profit margins.  Revenues in its snack business  improved as well, particularly in China.  Pepsi gained more than 3 percent,  closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall  Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock  trading volume.  But investors did focus on weakness in the company's bond  trading unit.  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than  5 percent on the day. </p><p>And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported  significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis.  And that sent  shares soaring after hours.  Vertex's two drug therapy improved patients'  lung function in a phase 2 study.  Now, shares had closed down at the end  of the session.  But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50  percent in after-hours trade.</p><p>GHARIB:  And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in  profits, and that's thanks to stronger sales.  And said it expects to open  as many as 180 new locations this year.  The company restated its guidance  of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close  gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading. </p><p>And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many  American companies looking for cheap labor.  But that could be all about to  change.</p><p>First, let's take a look at how the international markets finished the  day. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more  money shopping than at Walmart. </p><p>As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how  important Walmart's results are to investors and what they might reveal  about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season,  the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of  the consumer amid continued uncertainty.  And for decades running, it's the  earnings released from the world's largest retailer that is perhaps the  most anticipated. </p><p>JAN KNIFFEN:  Walmart is the bellwether.  And other than the time  period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has  always been the bellwether. </p><p>REAGAN:  A bellwether for good reason.  Every week, more than 200  million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around  the world.  For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of  more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch.  It  measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a  year.  While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five  quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p>(on camera):  Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning  investors that its earnings will miss expectations.  Saying the lingering  cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items.  Investors are now wondering if Walmart's sales have been  equally impacted.</p><p>(voice-over):  But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from  Walmart's consumer research.  Every quarter, the company surveys its  shoppers to take the pulse of what's concerning them most.  Last quarter,  Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs  followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p>Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren't worried. </p><p>KNIFFEN:  I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has  ever run since I started watching them in 1968.  They are doing a fabulous  job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p>REAGAN:  And the stockholders are reaping the benefits.  Walmart  shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail  index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one  company to watch this earnings season. </p><p>GHARIB:  So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers,  move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save  money.  But things have changed.  Rising costs for labor, material and  shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those  jobs back home.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Here in Shanghai,  U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new  challenge, rising costs.  In fact, a new study out today finds that the  total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the  U.S. by 2015.</p><p>For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in  Shanghai are rising faster than expected.  For example, labor wages are  jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain  skilled workers.  They've got 110 employees here in China, making  components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and  Honeywell.  And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually  move out of Shanghai.</p><p>MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO:  We're looking at different areas  in China.  Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where  we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area.  But in  the next five to seven years, I would say we'll definitely be somewhere  further inland.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in  China compared to India, Mexico and the United States.  Meanwhile, China's  currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10  years.</p><p>Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing  in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years.  Now, analysts believe the  cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the  U.S. within a couple of years. </p><p>STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  If you go back to 2005,  it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30  percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States.  Based on  our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been  closed. </p><p>LEBEAU:  The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers,  will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.? </p><p>Well, don't expect a huge rush of re-shoring.  There may be a few  companies to bring jobs back.  What's more likely is they will keep their  China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S.  plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p>One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in  China, productivity.  Now, it's improving here in China, but it's still not  to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S.  manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative  to firms here in China. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And tomorrow, we'll look at whether China, the world's  largest auto market, is about to become the world's most lucrative market  for luxury carmakers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its  trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p>First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies  fared today. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  You can call it a whale of a deal.  SeaWorld Entertainment --  this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell  shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock  Exchange.  It's offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27  each, raising $702 million. </p><p>Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash. </p><p>The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and  Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt  and grow its business. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can't see that stuff in Kansas. </p><p>WELLS:  SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and  the new owners return it had to profitability.  The recession put the  business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45  million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p>Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to  attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego. </p><p>TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE:  SeaWorld is one  of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p>WELLS (on camera):  But there are risks.  The company says it has  nearly $1.7 billion in debt.  And when your entire business model is built  around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p>(voice-over):  The company is appealing federal safety violations  after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago.  SeaWorld warns  it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses  to keep animals. </p><p>But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from  other theme park companies. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so  much, so I can't wait for my son to have that in his life as well. </p><p>WELLS:  Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is  a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up  under water.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And tomorrow, we'll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim  Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>And, Bill, I understand that he's bringing a penguin to help him ring  the opening bell tomorrow morning. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  One of the best-dressed bell ringers they've had at the New  York Stock Exchange in quite a while.  It's a great family story, but can  they continue to grow this franchise?  It's pretty long in the tooth. </p><p>GHARIB:  I'll ask him.  We'll find out. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Exactly.</p><p>GHARIB:  I'll report back tomorrow. </p><p>And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.   Thanks so much for watching. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We will see you  again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

A big night for technology as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM report earnings. We'll look at the winners and the losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Stocks slide again. Mixed earnings and a batch of economic numbers that missed projections drag down the major indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: China's cheap labor -- well, at least that was the case. But as costs rise, are some U.S. manufacturers thinking about pulling out?</p><p>All that and more tonight on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, April the 18th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. I'm Bill Griffeth, in this week for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>And, Susie, it's clear. Once again, that technology is going to set the tone for tomorrow, don't you think?</p><p>GHARIB: Three big tech names in the news tonight, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM. Three huge technology companies all reporting their latest quarterly earnings after the bell tonight with mixed results.</p><p>The results are important given new concerns about slowing global economic growth. And a sharp decline in the sales of personal computers this year. The report set up a flurry of activity in after-hours trading as the direction of all three companies will impact countless other tech suppliers and component makers on Friday.</p><p>And since IBM is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, investors will keep close watch on big blue shares tomorrow.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the first of the big three to report this evening, and that's where we begin with Seema Mody at the NASDAQ -- Seema.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Susie, a big day for tech. Let's run through the numbers.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) first -- a lot of concern around weakness and personal computer sales ahead of its earning report, but the numbers are out, and it beat the street by 4 cents on its bottom line. CEO Steve Ballmer said the bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off. The tech heavyweight also announced CFO Peter Klein will be leaving the company at the end of the year. It will name its new CFO in the next several weeks.</p><p>Let's also look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Shares are up after hours. The Internet giant reporting an EPS of $11.58 versus a street estimate of $10.66. However, its quarterly revenue of $13.97 billion came in slightly shy of the $14.09 billion expected by the street.</p><p>And lastly, big blue IBM, the diversified tech player that is many times seen as a good barometer of what to expect from the broader technology space missed street expectations on its top and bottom line due to a decline in hardware and services sales. Its first quarter EPS came in at $3 a share versus a $3.05 estimate.</p><p>The investment group says looking back over the last 10 years, IBM's one-day reaction to earnings has accurately predicted the direction of the S&amp;P 500 over the following five weeks, more than 75 percent of the time. And if that's the case, then tomorrow might be a down day.</p><p>We are seeing IBM shares down after hours.</p><p>Bill and Susie, back to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>And joining us right now to talk about technology and where he thinks it's headed is Ashok Kumar, senior technology analyst at Maxim Group.</p><p>Welcome back.</p><p>ASHOK KUMAR, MAXIM GROUP SR. TECHNOLOGY ANALYST: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All three that reported tonight missed on the top line. They were light on revenue. Does that worry you?</p><p>KUMAR: No, I think these are cyclical trends. In near term, I think the technology companies are faced with the macroeconomic climate which is weak across the developed markets. And they're seeing customers slow down across key end segments, including PCs and smartphones.</p><p>And the service side of the business I think we are seeing hesitancy among the large corporate accounts. So, it's more cyclical in nature than secular.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, this has been a tough time for technology companies, technology earnings. And there are so many changes happening in the technology space. And you see a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) once, you know, the darling of the tech sector.</p><p>Now it's, you know, kind of a broken company, so to speak. What is it, Ashok, that defines what makes a winner in the technology space versus an also-ran?</p><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. I mean, going back to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) story, I think the company's meteoric stock rise, you know, from the $100 to its peak to $700 I think reflected disruptive in a product cycle both in terms of price and unit. So the company came in and dominated the tablet market, came in and was creator of significant value in the smartphone segment.</p><p>And I think the company has been able to right that cycle, but now, of course, it's on the other side of that mountain, so to speak. So, over $200 billion of market cap has been removed. And so the company is looking forward, our best position, as you pointed out, in this undergoing transformation of the technology value chain, our position at the nexus or the intersection of -- in a consumer or cloud, the information, the mobility and social media, so we think the three companies that should benefit longer term are one, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), two, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, three, IBM.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We keep hearing the migration to mobile. We all have tablets. We all have smartphones.</p><p>What about the PC? Is -- are we looking at the sunset years for the personal computer right now?</p><p>KUMAR: I think it's become -- Bill, it's become primarily a replacement in a market. In other words, the life cycle of the PC continues to get extended because of the lack of compelling applications that are being written for the PC platform. So the go-to platform or the post-PC devices as Steve Jobs put it, the smartphones and the tablets, and that's where the application developer community is focused on.</p><p>GHARIB: You see a wide range of technology companies. Let me just get back to, you know, which are the ones, the companies that you think have the platforms that are on the cutting edge. And maybe not any of the companies that we've been talking about tonight that reported earnings.</p><p>KUMAR: Absolutely. That's a very good point because it seems that investors at the margin are focusing and voting with the dollars and disrupters, and these could be companies like Salesforce, it could be a company like Workday, it could be companies like (INAUDIBLE) networks and moving away from legacy companies like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (NYSE:EMC) and to a lesser degree, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what about an IBM? I mean, so influential for years. They've made this transition through the services industry. They were cutting edge on that. What did you think of their earnings, and where do you think they're going from here?</p><p>KUMAR: Bill, you raise a lot of key points on IBM. I think they were early to recognize industry transition away from hardware to software and services in the '90s. So the company's portfolio, if you look at it in a longer-term perspective, it's very counter-cyclical. So they're able to write the software and services, they're in a position to grow, you know, the top and bottom line, high single digits over longer term.</p><p>So I think yes, there are some cyclical issues that are buffeting the near-term performance. But from a longer-term perspective, they're very well-positioned to address their customer needs.</p><p>GHARIB: So, this has been a big week for technology earnings. A lot of people are wondering, you know, what impact this is going to have on trading tomorrow. Do you think that this latest batch is going to influence stocks to the positive or the negative either way?</p><p>KUMAR: No, I think from a training perspective, which is very near- term oriented, yes. But longer term, I think technology sector creates a tremendous amount of value across key markets and segments. It's global in theme, it's secular in themes. So, I think these are cyclical factors that are impacting performance.</p><p>But longer term, value proposition in terms of risk return is very compelling on these key technology leaders in the sector.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Ashok Kumar of the Maxim Group, good to see you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>KUMAR: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: On Wall Street today, another day of selling and volatile trading, a round of disappointing economic reports and earnings sent the major averages lower.</p><p>The biggest decliner in the Dow, United Health Care, falling nearly 4 percent more. We'll have more on that in our \"Market Focus\". And the NASDAQ was hit by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that we were just talking about, closing before $400 a share for the first time since December of 2011.</p><p>Looking at the closing numbers: the Dow down 81 points, the NASDAQ lost 38 and the S&amp;P 500 off 10 points.</p><p>Also weighing on the markets, first-time jobless claims rose by 4,000 last week. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said business activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed down this month. And the read on leading economic indicators unexpectedly declined in March, falling for the first time in four months.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But there has been no slowdown in auto sales so far this year. And with sales of cars and pickups revving higher, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) reported a record-breaking quarter before the bell.</p><p>The country's largest auto dealership owner reported that first quarter profits rose by 14 percent on a best-ever 68 cents a share with revenues that topped $4 billion. Sales of new and used cars were higher last quarter, getting help from the recovery in housing and the chain even announced plans to expand.</p><p>GHARIB: AutoNation (NYSE:AN) CEO Michael Jackson joins us now.</p><p>Mike, nice to see you again.</p><p>I want to ask you, why is this business so good, and is it safe to say now that the car business is getting back to normal?</p><p>MICHAEL JACKSON, AUTONATION: Well, Susie, you have to look at it within the context in the auto industry. We had a depression, a complete crash, a complete breakdown in '08, '09, '10. We could not get financing for our customers. So business practically came to a standstill.</p><p>And so, what happened is, it pushed out the average age of cars in America to 11 years old. It's unprecedented. And people really need to do something at this point. The trades we're looking at have 150,000 miles on it. So people stop buying cars, stop repairing cars for several years, and now there's genuine replacement need.</p><p>So they come in to talk to us, and we have the best product offering ever, outstanding quality. And by quality, I mean fit, finish, design --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>JACKSON: -- innovation, content, and dramatically improved fuel economy. We don't ask customers to downsize or go slower, and you don't have to buy exotic hybrids or electric. Mainstream technology will give you a 25 percent to 30 percent improvement in fuel economy.</p><p>And finally, we have the best financing ever because ironically during the downturn that customers continued to pay for the cars.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>JACKSON: We were the first payment-to-household made. So the banks have really moved back into financing cars.</p><p>So you put it all together, you really have a lot of structural support for this one bright spot in the U.S. economy, the automotive recovery.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It's clear to see why you're a superstar salesman, Mike.</p><p>One of the trends we've seen in the recovery has been the tremendous strength of the rental -- not the rental -- of the used car market. Is that still the case? Are people tending to buy more used cars than they did in the past?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, the used car story is the following. We are selling big improvements in used cars and new cars. And because there's such a shortage of used cars because production came -- was so dramatically low from '08, '09 during the depression, there is a shortage which means the value of the trades are at record highs.</p><p>So people, had they come in, not only do we have all those other drivers that are already called out, but then we say listen, we can give you more money for your trade than you're ever going to get. And they say, great, I'm ready to get something newer, whether it's still used or new.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me ask you this, Mike. I know you hear this all the time. Everybody's talking about the pros and cons of zero percent interest rates and talking about at some point they're going to go up. When interest rates do go up, will consumers be less likely to be interested in buying a car and to finance it?</p><p>JACKSON: No, I think these record low interest rates, everybody knows that it will not continue. I should be clear, the market rate that customers are paying today, let's say around 3.5 percent, 4 percent, if you talk zero percent, that is an incentive that has been bought down by a manufacturer. So, the real world is 3.5 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>But customers are used to paying 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent on the financing of an automobile. So I don't think the normalization of interest rates to those levels is going to unseat these drivers that I've called out that are driving this recovery. We're in the early innings of this automotive recovery. We're on a journey back to the industry, selling 16 million, 17 million units a year.</p><p>GHARIB: So, that's nice to end on an upbeat note.</p><p>Thank you, Mike. So good to see you. Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation (NYSE:AN).</p><p>JACKSON: Good to see you.</p><p>GHARIB: And sticking with the theme of retail a little later in the program, we'll look at why Walmart is one earnings report to watch when that sector reports.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, United Healthcare beat earnings estimates and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>But it wasn't all positive. The company also said first quarter profits dropped because of lower government payments for its Medicare services. The company warned that the sequester would pressure profits the rest of this year, and it did not issue specific guidance for 2014.</p><p>United Healthcare was off almost 4 percent to $59 and change, followed by other insurers like Humana (NYSE:HUM), Aetna (NYSE:AET) and WellPoint, all down at least 2 percent at the close.</p><p>GHARIB: Dow blue chip Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported increased profits thanks to its booming wireless business and lower costs. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) activated 4 million iPhones during the quarter. Shares hit a new all-time high today before dropping back to close at $50.91, up almost 3 percent.</p><p>PepsiCo also touched a new all-time high today as soft drink price increases helped boost profit margins. Revenues in its snack business improved as well, particularly in China. Pepsi gained more than 3 percent, closing at $81.45 a share.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) is the last Wall Street bank to report, came in above estimates, helped by a boost in stock trading volume. But investors did focus on weakness in the company's bond trading unit. Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) shares lost more than 5 percent on the day.</p><p>And after the close, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported significant progress in test patients with cystic fibrosis. And that sent shares soaring after hours. Vertex's two drug therapy improved patients' lung function in a phase 2 study. Now, shares had closed down at the end of the session. But after the report came out, they were up as much as 50 percent in after-hours trade.</p><p>GHARIB: And chipotle reported a blowout 22 percent increase in profits, and that's thanks to stronger sales. And said it expects to open as many as 180 new locations this year. The company restated its guidance of flat to low single-digit same-store growth for the rest of the year.</p><p>Shares of chipotle which were down more than 3 percent at the close gained as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>And coming up, moving operations to China was a no-brainer for many American companies looking for cheap labor. But that could be all about to change.</p><p>First, let's take a look at how the international markets finished the day.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: As you know, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, and nowhere do Americans spend more money shopping than at Walmart.</p><p>As we continue our \"Earnings Spotlight,\" Courtney Reagan tells us how important Walmart's results are to investors and what they might reveal about consumers and other big retailers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While the bulk of retailers report earnings towards the end of the season, the results are closely monitored by investors trying to take the pulse of the consumer amid continued uncertainty. And for decades running, it's the earnings released from the world's largest retailer that is perhaps the most anticipated.</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN: Walmart is the bellwether. And other than the time period where Walmart was doing Project Impact a few years ago, it has always been the bellwether.</p><p>REAGAN: A bellwether for good reason. Every week, more than 200 million consumers shop in the nearly 10,800 Walmart retail locations around the world. For the first quarter, Walmart is expected to report revenue of more than $116 billion, with earnings of $1.15 per share.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. same-store sales is a key metric investors watch. It measures the amount sales increased or decreased for stores open at least a year. While the retailer has posted a gain in each of the last five quarters, the growth rate shows a downward trend.</p><p>(on camera): Walmart competitor Target (NYSE:TGT) is warning investors that its earnings will miss expectations. Saying the lingering cold weather in much of the country has hurt sales of seasonal and weather- sensitive items. Investors are now wondering if Walmart's sales have been equally impacted.</p><p>(voice-over): But beyond the financials, investors glean insight from Walmart's consumer research. Every quarter, the company surveys its shoppers to take the pulse of what's concerning them most. Last quarter, Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon says his consumers were most worried bout jobs followed by inflation, taxes and gas prices.</p><p>Consumers may have concerns, but a number of analysts aren't worried.</p><p>KNIFFEN: I think Walmart right now is running as well as Walmart has ever run since I started watching them in 1968. They are doing a fabulous job of bringing product at the price to the customer.</p><p>REAGAN: And the stockholders are reaping the benefits. Walmart shares gained 27 percent over the last year, better than the S&amp;P retail index and the broader S&amp;P 500 over the same time period.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And tomorrow, we turn our attention to housing and the one company to watch this earnings season.</p><p>GHARIB: So many American companies, including many Walmart suppliers, move manufacturing out of the U.S. to plants in China, looking to save money. But things have changed. Rising costs for labor, material and shipping has forced a lot of companies to consider bringing some of those jobs back home.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Shanghai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Here in Shanghai, U.S. manufacturers who have set up plants here in China are facing a new challenge, rising costs. In fact, a new study out today finds that the total cost of manufacturing in China will rise to the same level as the U.S. by 2015.</p><p>For Prince Industries based in Illinois, costs for its plant here in Shanghai are rising faster than expected. For example, labor wages are jumping 12 percent every year due to the competition to attract and retain skilled workers. They've got 110 employees here in China, making components companies sell to firms like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Honeywell. And the CEO says those rising costs may force him to eventually move out of Shanghai.</p><p>MARK MILLER, PRINCE INDUSTRIES CEO: We're looking at different areas in China. Shanghai has been high cost to manufacture, but that was where we initially went to, and all of our customers were in that area. But in the next five to seven years, I would say we'll definitely be somewhere further inland.</p><p>LEBEAU: Take a look at how fast hourly wages have climbed here in China compared to India, Mexico and the United States. Meanwhile, China's currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 25 percent over the last 10 years.</p><p>Put those together and you see why the overall cost of manufacturing in China has gone up so rapidly in recent years. Now, analysts believe the cost of manufacturing here in China will be equal to manufacturing in the U.S. within a couple of years.</p><p>STEVE MAURER, ALIXPARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: If you go back to 2005, it was pretty common for landed costs from China to be 25 percent to 30 percent less than the cost of manufacturing in the United States. Based on our analysis, that gap has been -- about two-thirds of that gap has been closed.</p><p>LEBEAU: The rising costs here in China mean more U.S. manufacturers, will pull out of this country and bring jobs back to the U.S.?</p><p>Well, don't expect a huge rush of re-shoring. There may be a few companies to bring jobs back. What's more likely is they will keep their China plants focused on selling to companies here in China while U.S. plants pick up more of the manufacturing for companies in the U.S.</p><p>One big advantage U.S. manufacturing plants have over those here in China, productivity. Now, it's improving here in China, but it's still not to the level where it is in the U.S. and because of that productivity, U.S. manufacturing plants have been able to keep their costs in check relative to firms here in China.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Shanghai, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we'll look at whether China, the world's largest auto market, is about to become the world's most lucrative market for luxury carmakers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: In the meantime, still ahead, SeaWorld is set to make its trading debut tomorrow, but should investors dive in?</p><p>First, a look, though, at how commodities, treasuries and currencies fared today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: You can call it a whale of a deal. SeaWorld Entertainment -- this is the amusement park behind Shamu, the killer whale -- will sell shares to the public for the first time ever tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange. It's offering 26 million shares, and they price tonight at $27 each, raising $702 million.</p><p>Jane Wells takes a closer look at the company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): SeaWorld is hoping its stock market debut will make a big splash.</p><p>The company made up of 11 theme parks including Busch Gardens and Aquatica wants to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pay down debt and grow its business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED BOY: I want to see sharks and stingrays.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can't see that stuff in Kansas.</p><p>WELLS: SeaWorld was bought by the Blackstone Group back in 2009, and the new owners return it had to profitability. The recession put the business on something of a rollercoaster, but net income swung from a $45 million loss in 2010 to over $77 million in profits last year.</p><p>Customers are spending more money, and the company is hoping to attract more international travelers, especially to San Diego.</p><p>TONY CHERIN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV. PROF. OF FINANCE: SeaWorld is one of the major attractions for those international travelers.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): But there are risks. The company says it has nearly $1.7 billion in debt. And when your entire business model is built around 67,000 animals, there are unique challenges.</p><p>(voice-over): The company is appealing federal safety violations after an orca killed a trainer in Orlando three years ago. SeaWorld warns it could always be subject to changing regulations or the loss of licenses to keep animals.</p><p>But the animals are what make SeaWorld entertainment stand apart from other theme park companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, as a kid, I learned and loved Shamu so much, so I can't wait for my son to have that in his life as well.</p><p>WELLS: Investors will decide when shares start trading if SeaWorld is a whale of a buy or they best avoid the stock for fear it could end up under water.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, San Diego.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And tomorrow, we'll be speaking with CEO of SeaWorld, Jim Atchison at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And, Bill, I understand that he's bringing a penguin to help him ring the opening bell tomorrow morning.</p><p>GRIFFETH: One of the best-dressed bell ringers they've had at the New York Stock Exchange in quite a while. It's a great family story, but can they continue to grow this franchise? It's pretty long in the tooth.</p><p>GHARIB: I'll ask him. We'll find out.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Exactly.</p><p>GHARIB: I'll report back tomorrow.</p><p>And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

The yield on the 10-year hit its highest level since 2014.  </p><p> Apple's four percent drop dragged the technology sector lower after Morgan  Stanley (NYSE:MS) said it expects the company's iPhone sales to disappoint.   At the close, the Dow Jones Industrials Average fell 201 points to 24,462.   The Nasdaq was off 91 and the S&amp;P 500 lost 22.</p><p> Despite today's declines, stocks were higher for the week.  And now that  we're a few months into an unusual year on Wall Street, many are trying to  figure out what happens next.  </p><p> So, Mike Santoli went looking for some answers.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market  finds itself once again at a crossroads.  Nearly three months after  reaching a peak, the S&amp;P 500 index is about flat for the year and roughly  halfway between that record high and the low of early February.  Volatility  readings have come down sharply as the market has stabilized.  Yet the  indexes remain far jumpier than they were all of last year.  </p><p> Corporate earnings are quite strong, even better than lofty forecasts.  Yet  investors are not rewarded good results for higher share prices across the  board.  The market's indecision reflects several factors.  Tax cuts and a  surging global economy are enriching companies and helping consumers, yet  those same factors are pushing interest rates higher.  The 10-year treasury  has climbed back to 2.95 percent, its high for the year and the level last  seen two months ago.  The S&amp;P has been caught near or below its current  level each time bond yields have been this close to 3 percent.  </p><p> A surge in oil and other commodity prices and reports of upward pressure on  wages have revived inflation concerns and boosted expectations that the  Federal Reserve will look to raise short-term rates several more times in  the next couple of years.  And concerns about big tech stock valuation and  the risk of hostile regulations for powerful Silicon Valley companies have  slowed this sector, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500's  value.  </p><p> While these factors have kept stocks in this neutral zone, the market has  made progress on some front.  The indexes have held above those February  lows throughout all the trade war and political noise of recent months.   The valuation of the market has also come down nicely as stock prices have  stagnated, while earnings have grown fast.  </p><p> And investor sentiment is a good deal more subdued than it was in January  which is usually a necessary condition for stocks forming a durable base.   Taken together, it means t market is approaching the one-third point of the  year, clinging to its long-term uptrend.  But with plenty to prove before  investors can be sure that this was just a routine correction or that it's  over.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And as bond yields head higher, the Federal Reserve Governor Lael  Brainard today said the economy is strengthening and appears capable of  withstanding gradual interest rate increases.  She's also pleased to see  inflation moving towards the central bank's target.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAE:  Today, actually, inflation is moving more in line with what one would  expect at this point.  And, in fact, there I think, you know, we are  looking carefully at inflation and expecting to see it move towards target  in line with our objectives.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  So with inflation and interest rates ticking higher, how can  investors protect their money and maybe even profit?  </p><p> Bob Pisani did some digging.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Can you protect  yourself against inflation and higher rates?  In the last several years,  the ETF business has expanded dramatically, with more than 2,000 products  in all corners of the market.  With rates moving up and inflation issues  prominent, is it possible to purchase products that benefit from inflation?   You can, but it's tricky.  </p><p> One of the beneficiaries of inflation concerns has been commodities.  So,  oil stocks and steel and aluminum producers.  Fortunately, there are ways  to play the trend.  Oil and gas exploration and production ETF, XOP is the  simple, is a basket of companies that explore for oil and gas.  It's up  over 10 percent this month.</p><p> And you can play this in an even broader way, the VanEck natural resources  ETF, symbol HAP, invest in oil and gas producers but also mining and  agribusiness stocks.  It's up 4 percent.  </p><p> You can even get more exotic.  How about timber?  PowerShares global timber  ETF, the symbol is CUT.  Invest in timber companies, like Weyerhaeuser  (NYSE:WY), an international paper.  Why?  The theory is that timber-related  products have been seen as hedges against inflation in the past.  </p><p> Now, commodities are not the only play on inflation.  Some are buying  variable rate loans which rise as interest rates rise.  Using ETFs like the  PowerShares senior loan portfolio, the symbol is BKLN.  Others are trying  to short treasury bonds using ETFs.  This is a further bet essentially that  interest rates will rise.  </p><p> A lot of choices out there.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The rise in bond yields means mortgage rates are going up.  And as  Diana Olick reports, the timing couldn't be worse for a housing market  that's already facing a number of headwinds.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Buying a home just got  a little more expensive.  And this is a big weekend for buyers as real  estate agencies and home builders are running big spring promotions and  sales.  Mortgage rates which loosely follow the yield on the ten-year  treasury hit their highest level yesterday since the end of March, breaking  out of a tight range where they've been sitting for a while.  </p><p> The move came as bond yields surged higher, while the increase won't mean a  ton in terms of the average monthly payment for a homebuyer, it could be  signaling the start of another steady rise, which we saw at the start of  this year.  And that can take an emotional toll not just on buyers but on  sellers as well.  As rates rise, fewer homeowners will want to sell and buy  another home because they would likely be giving up record low rates in the  3 percent range to move and pay on a rate closer to 5 percent.  </p><p> The entire nation is in the midst of a supply crisis and home builders are  not ramping up as much as hoped because of higher costs for materials and a  labor shortage.  That's just pushing home prices ever higher.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  General Electric (NYSE:GE) was the best performing stock on the  blue chip Dow index and it's been a while since we've been able to say  that.  This, after the company reported earnings and revenue that exceed  expectations.  The CEO says the quarter represents a step forward in that  company's turnaround.  Investors breathed a sigh of relief, sending shares  up nearly 4 percent.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan has more on GE's results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Dow's oldest  component reporting earnings that beat expectations and it reaffirmed its  outlook for a full-year profit and cash flow.  On a conference call with  analyst, the GE CEO and chairman John Flannery calling the results his  first report card, saying, quote, we see signs of progress.  </p><p> JOHN FLANNERY, GENERAL ELECTRIC CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  There's no change to our  framework of $1 to $1.07 earnings per share with $67 billion of free cash  flow.  We expect earnings pressure in power will be offset by better  aviation and better health care earnings and lower corporate costs.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Flannery, who took the helm last August and has been aggressively  cutting costs.  He's also moving forward with billions of dollars worth of  divestitures.  Including a locomotive's unit and GE's iconic lighting  business.  The updates were welcomed by Wall Street because after a month  of disclosures, charges and negative revisions, no news has become good  news.  </p><p> STEVEN WINOKER, UBS:  I think what they're going to be able to do is look  back on 2018 as the bottom, right, and 2019, even if power markets don't  recover, they're finding a way to take costs out in an aggressive way, to  still drive margin expansion, despite weak power markets.  And that's  really the trick as well as looking at the portfolio little more  objectively.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  When it comes to that portfolio, Flannery again saying all  options are on the table, for the bigger update of the long-term future of  the industrial conglomerate, expected in the coming months.  </p><p> Next on tap, the company will host its shareholder meeting next week to  bring in new directors to its corporate board.  Meantime, G.E. stock did  finish the day higher.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan at the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Twitter was upgraded to buy from neutral at MKM Partners.  The analyst  cites factors including user growth and Twitter's mass market potential.   The price target was increased to $40.  Twitter shares rose 1 percent to  $31.91.  </p><p> Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI (NASDAQ:TBUS)) was upgraded to outperform from  market perform at Bernstein.  The analyst expects Darden's Olive Garden  Restaurants to perform well and cites long-term margin expansion.  The  price target is $105 per share.  The shares were up more than 1 percent to  $91.05.  </p><p> Tractor Supplies rating was raised to overweight from neutral at Piper  Jaffray.  The analyst there citing improving business trends in the  agricultural industry.  The firm's price target on the specialty retailer  is $72 a share.  The stock rose just a fraction to $60.33.  </p><p> Still ahead, 'tis the season for sneezing and sniffling.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Spring is here and  that means allergy season is upon us.  Coming up, a look at why your  allergies may be getting worse and at the big business of allergy medicine.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  As many as 1.5 million SunTrust customers may have had their data  compromised after an employee stole client contract lists.  SunTrust CEO  said the employee who has since left that company was working with a  criminal third party when those lists were taken.  Separately, the bank  reported earnings which topped expectations.  </p><p> Last night, we told you that regulators were close to finding Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) $1 billion for forcing customers into car insurance and charging  mortgage borrowers unfair fees.  Today, that record fine became official.   The bank will pay $5 million to the comptroller of the currency and $500  million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The fine is the  largest ever imposed by the CFPB.  </p><p> The Justice Department has reportedly opened an antitrust probe into  potential collusion between AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).  According  to \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT),\" regulators allege the companies worked  together to make it more difficult for consumers to switch wireless  carriers.  The investigation was opened five months ago.  Both Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) fell on this down market day.  Other reports  said Sprint and T-Mobile also received requests from the Department of  Justice.  </p><p> One of China's top telecom companies is crying foul over the U.S.  government's decision to ban American firms from providing components or  software to ZTE.  As we reported, the ban was imposed this week by the  Commerce Department.  And as Eunice Yoon reports, ZTE is making its  opposition known.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  ZTE's chairman called  a press conference today to protest a seven-year ban imposed by the U.S.  Commerce Department.  The ban blocks American companies from selling  components to the Chinese smartphone maker.  ZTE pled guilty last year for  violating U.S. sanctions by supplying to Iran.  The company agreed to pay a  hefty fine of $900 million and could take steps against the employees  involved.  </p><p> At the press conference, the chairman admitted to being slow to fulfilling  the settlement but said the punishment didn't match the crime.  Such  sanctions could put the company into a coma, he said.  We resolutely oppose  such an unfair, unreasonable punishments and especially the act of  politicizing trade.  </p><p> The smartphone maker said it would use all legal means necessary to  safeguard its rights.  There are two competing reactions in China to ZTE's  case.  One is the attempt to whip up national sentiment to support the  company and China's high-tech industry.  In the state media, \"The China  Daily\" ran a headline that read p reads the U.S. action against ZTE aims to  hit China's 5G advantages.  </p><p> At the same time, the case has shaken up some people here about the dangers  of getting into a trade war with the United States because they realize  that the U.S. makes a lot of products that the Chinese need.  </p><p> On social media, one user said, from this I learned how big a gap there is  between China and the U.S. in tech development.  Another says only when you  have high tech can you have a say.  </p><p> Experts here have been calling for China to speed up its efforts to develop  its own homegrown chip industry.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Honeywell hikes its forecast for the second time this year.  And  that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> A strong quarter helped by strength in the company's aerospace business  prompted Honeywell to raise its guidance for 2018.  Honeywell also said  it's taking aggressive action to mitigate any negative impact caused from  the new tarries on imported steel and aluminum.  Shares rose 1-1/2 percent  to $150.57.  </p><p>Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) topped sales expectations but investors  were disappointed to see a drop in quarterly profit and a weaker full-year  outlook.  The tools maker said the new guidance was result of an  acquisition and a tax charge.  Shares finished down more than 6 percent  to144.21.  </p><p> Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) said strength in nearly all of its divisions helped  earnings and revenue top expectations.  The oil field services company also  warned the industry will face supply challenges this year and will need new  investments to offset a shortage.  Shares of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) fell  about 1.5 percent to $69.23.  </p><p> And the activist hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a 9 percent stake in  pinnacle food, saying it plans to talk to the owner of Birds Eye and Duncan  Hines brands about exploring a potential sale.  Jana also plans to nominate  new directors and suggest ways that Pinnacle can cut costs.  Shares of  Pinnacle Foods jumped nearly 10 percent to $60.58.  </p><p> HERERA:  It is time now for our weekly market monitor who has names of  stocks he says are the number one winners of the digital economy.  The last  time he was on back in October, he liked Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is  down 5 percent, Esperion Therapeutics, which is up 55 percent, and Wave  Life Sciences, which is 96 percent higher.  </p><p> Joining us is Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities.  </p><p> Welcome back.  Nice to see you, Mark.</p><p> MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Sue.  Appreciate it.</p><p> HERERA:  And congratulations on a couple of those picks.  We think that's  terrific that you're giving our viewers that kind of advice.  </p><p> Let's start with -- you're talking about the digital economy.  And there  have been a number of challenges in the digital economy lately.  And some  of it involves one of your picks which we'll get to in a second.  </p><p> But you like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  A lot of people think Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) has run pretty far, pretty fast.  </p><p> LEHMANN:  Well, they're right and it has been in the news as of late.  And  it has run a lot.  But it's one of those names I think you want to  continually watch.  If you have an opportunity like we've had when it was  in the news for other reasons and you got a chance at much lower than it is  today, that's when you want to pay attention.  </p><p> It has moved a lot.  It's a volatile name.  And when you have volatility,  you have an opportunity potentially to buy it at a much more reasonable  price when you think the fundamentals won't change and I think that's why  Amazon's the top of our list here at JMP Securities.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK, the one stock that has always been in the news I was referring  to a second ago is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  You're taking a bit of a  contrarian view on this one.  </p><p> LEHMANN:  We are.  And it has been in the news as of late.  Everybody knows  Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress.  But the stock I think is  much more reasonably priced, despite all the headlines and all the headline  risk.  I think there will be some regulation.  I think they'll be some  self-regulation that I think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will go through.  </p><p> But the juggernaut that they have with the consumers and the juggernaut  they have with advertisers, I don't think it's going to change.  And I  think you have a stock at a much more attractive valuation.  I think you  need to ignore some of the noise you'll get with the current quarter and  know that you're still buying a winner at less than 20 times earnings and  that's a stock again that I think is the winner in the digital economy.   And you got a chance to buy it cheaper, you should.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK, but as an investor, you need to be aware there may be some  headline risk with that name, right?  </p><p> LEHMANN:  Absolutely, and I think, you know, you probably haven't heard the  last of it.  I think there's definitely more of self-awareness they're  going through.  But I'd pick Mark Zuckerberg and his teammates any day.   And I think the juggernaut that they have with their couple billion users  and their million daily active users you want to be a part of.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.  We'll wrap it up with Zillow Group.  Why do you like it?  </p><p> LEHMANN:  It's another company that's at the top of their game in terms of  the sector they're in of the real estate market.  It has gone through a  little bit of consternation as of late.  They talked about expanding some  of the breadth of their products lately.  It's caused the stock to  deteriorate a little bit from its recent highs.  </p><p> But it is the number one brand in that sector, in the real estate market.   All the consumers know that name.  I think if they continue to expand their  offering, it's more reasonably priced today, and I think nine months down  the road, you're going to want to own that stock.  Here at attractive  levels, it's a good entry point.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  We'll leave it at that, Mark, thanks so much.</p><p> LEHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Mark Lehmann with JMP securities.  And you can read more about his  stock picks on our Website which is NBR.com.  </p><p> Well, it is spring, and as the temperatures rise, so does the pollen count.   And that means millions of people will turn to allergy medicines to  alleviate their sneezing and sniffling and watery eyes.  And that is big  business for a number of companies.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Each spring, the  National Cherry Blossom Festival draws more than 1 million visitors to  Washington, D.C.  Visitors like 74-year-old Sandra Czarkowski, who loves  the view but hated the way it made her feel.  </p><p> SANDRA CZARKOWSKI, ALLERGY SUFFERER:  It's deceptive when you see something  so beautiful and it really knocks you right over.  You can't sleep.  You  can't breathe.  But I cope.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Czarkowski is one of 50 million Americans who suffer from  seasonal allergies which cause irritating symptoms like stuffy nose and  itchy ice but also more serious effects from coughing and wheezing to  asthma attacks.  Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist at NYU says seasonal  allergies are getting more severe.  </p><p> DR. PURVI PARIKH, NYU ALLERGIST:  Climate change is a big reason for that,  because our carbon dioxide levels are now higher, the pollen is much more  potent and the plants are almost producing super pollen and the seasons are  much longer.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Allergy medicines are big business for the pharmaceutical  industry, drawing more than $2.6 billion in U.S. revenue in the last year,  according to data from Nielsen.  That's just for over the counter products  like J&amp;J Zyrtec, GlaxoSmithKline's Flonase and Bayer's Claritin, and  doesn't include prescription medicines.  </p><p> The cost for consumers can add up.  </p><p> Sandra Czarkowski uses a prescription inhaler that she says costs her $50  out of pocket.  </p><p> CZARKOWSKI:  There are people that cannot get relief because they can't pay  the price.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  But for her and other allergy sufferers like this 26-year-old  student and waitress Jessica Fuentes, going without allergy medications is  not an option.  </p><p> JESSICA FUENTES, ALLERGY SUFFERER:  I'm just going to be like waterfall of  just all over the place I guess.  It's, yes, it's an uncomfortable feeling.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Here's wishing everyone a less sniffly spring.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell from the New York Botanical  Garden, Bronx, New York.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, the new ways to get to space.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BRENNAN:  I'm Morgan Brennan in Colorado Springs.  It is the biggest space  conference of the year and one of the hottest topics, blue origin's rocket  engines.  We catch up with the space company created by Jeff Bezos to talk  about space tourism, its next generation rocket and technology.  That's  coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Here's a look at what to watch next week.  On Tuesday, Dow  components 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) will report quarterly results.  On Wednesday, we'll hear from  blue chip Boeing (NYSE:BA).  And on Friday, a look at how much the economy  grew in the first quarter.  And that is what to watch for next week.  </p><p> President Trump criticized OPEC and the cartel's role in pushing up oil  prices.  He wrote, quote: Looks like OPEC is at it again.  With record  amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea,  oil prices are artificially very high.  No good and will not be accepted,  end quote.  </p><p> That tweet sent oil prices lower earlier in the day, but they recovered and  settled slightly higher.  </p><p>OPEC's secretary-general has said that the organization does not have a  price objective but is working to restore stability to the oil markets.  </p><p> The FAA is issuing an emergency directive, ordering inspections of more jet  engines like the one involved in the fatal Southwest accident.  The new  order goes beyond what was previously proposed.  Engines with the high  number of takeoffs and landings must complete inspections within 20 days.   European regulators are also issuing a similar order.  </p><p> Private American companies are competing to become leaders in the new space  race and in the process, phase out our reliance on Russian parts.  One of  those companies is Blue Origin.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan is back with us tonight, filing this report from Colorado  Springs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BRENNAN:  Meet Blue Origin's new rocket engine, the BE-4.  It represents a  crucial step toward intergalactic dominance but it's also a matter of  national security.  </p><p> I think a lot of Americans don't realize that some of the most sensitive  security and military missions right now in terms of space are being  powered by Russian-made rockets.  So, this actually represents really kind  of a shift in terms of American manufacturing.  </p><p> What's the opportunity there?  </p><p> BOB SMITH, BLUE ORIGIN CEO:  The opportunity has to do to replace those  rockets and get on to American rockets, buying American payloads.  So, it's  exciting actually to do that.  This is something we developed with our own  dollars, so we're excited about the commercial opportunities that that's  going to give us.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Bob Smith is the CEO of Blue Origins, space startup created by  Amazon's Jeff Bezos.  </p><p> At the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Smith sowed off the new  technology, in his first on-camera interview since taking the helm last  year.  </p><p> SMITH:  We spent so much time in development.  That's over seven years  developing this engine to make it reusable.  This engine will actually  perform 100 starts, and 100 formations that we'd actually be able to go do.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  The company develops the engine for its own rockets which are  expected to begin launching satellites and other payloads into orbit as  soon as 2020.  But the company also hopes to sell them to United Launch  Alliance or ULA.  The industry consortium owned by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).  </p><p>ULA currently relies on Russian engines.  Lawmakers want those phased out.   So, ULA is developing its own new rockets.</p><p> TORY BRUNO, UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  We're going to fly  Vulcan in the middle of 2020.  We're so excited about that.  We'll begin  introducing reusability elements just a couple of two, three years later.   And then full new technologies in an advance upper stage.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Blue Origin is competing against Aerojet Rocketdyne to build the  engine for the Vulcan.  A contract its expected to win when the decision is  announced, quote, soon.  </p><p> Smith says it will mean a new revenue stream and fit into a broader  strategy taken from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook.  </p><p> SMITH: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) goes and builds capabilities, builds  capabilities, gains some customer base and continues to build on that.   We're going to do the same kind of strategy of building capability after  capability and making sure we get customer adoption as we go along.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Blue Origin is already courting customers for its own rocket and  its space terrorism ambitions plans to carry paying passengers past the  edge of space could take flight as soon as this year.  It all speaks to the  unprecedented role the private sector's playing in this new space race.  As  billionaire visions now become realities.  </p><p> SMITH:  Well, I think we'll have obviously flying space tourists.  We'll be  flying several payloads as well.  We'll be I think the pre-eminent engine  provider in the country.  We'll also have our new vehicle that we'll be  using not only for civil and commercial but financial security payloads as  well.  So, I think at that point, we will be in very much the position we  want to be as we stand in today.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Colorado  Springs.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And before we go, here's a look at the day and the week on Wall  Street.  The Dow fell 201 points.  The Nasdaq was off 91.  And the S&amp;P 500  lost 22.  For the week, the major indices were all fractionally higher.  </p><p> And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great weekend, everybody.  We will  see you right back here on Monday.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks drop  sharply to end the week as bond yields rise and investors try to figure out  what's next for this market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Electric results.  G.E. surprises investors with much stronger than  expected earnings.  Is the worst finally behind the troubled industrial?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nothing to sneeze at.  Allergy season is in full bloom and that is big  business for some major drug companies.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, April  20th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Bill Griffeth is off  tonight.  </p><p>It was a rough way to end the week.  Stocks fell sharply as bond yields  rose.  The yield on the 10-year hit its highest level since 2014.  </p><p>Apple's four percent drop dragged the technology sector lower after Morgan  Stanley (NYSE:MS) said it expects the company's iPhone sales to disappoint.   At the close, the Dow Jones Industrials Average fell 201 points to 24,462.   The Nasdaq was off 91 and the S&amp;P 500 lost 22.</p><p>Despite today's declines, stocks were higher for the week.  And now that  we're a few months into an unusual year on Wall Street, many are trying to  figure out what happens next.  </p><p>So, Mike Santoli went looking for some answers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market  finds itself once again at a crossroads.  Nearly three months after  reaching a peak, the S&amp;P 500 index is about flat for the year and roughly  halfway between that record high and the low of early February.  Volatility  readings have come down sharply as the market has stabilized.  Yet the  indexes remain far jumpier than they were all of last year.  </p><p>Corporate earnings are quite strong, even better than lofty forecasts.  Yet  investors are not rewarded good results for higher share prices across the  board.  The market's indecision reflects several factors.  Tax cuts and a  surging global economy are enriching companies and helping consumers, yet  those same factors are pushing interest rates higher.  The 10-year treasury  has climbed back to 2.95 percent, its high for the year and the level last  seen two months ago.  The S&amp;P has been caught near or below its current  level each time bond yields have been this close to 3 percent.  </p><p>A surge in oil and other commodity prices and reports of upward pressure on  wages have revived inflation concerns and boosted expectations that the  Federal Reserve will look to raise short-term rates several more times in  the next couple of years.  And concerns about big tech stock valuation and  the risk of hostile regulations for powerful Silicon Valley companies have  slowed this sector, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500's  value.  </p><p>While these factors have kept stocks in this neutral zone, the market has  made progress on some front.  The indexes have held above those February  lows throughout all the trade war and political noise of recent months.   The valuation of the market has also come down nicely as stock prices have  stagnated, while earnings have grown fast.  </p><p>And investor sentiment is a good deal more subdued than it was in January  which is usually a necessary condition for stocks forming a durable base.   Taken together, it means t market is approaching the one-third point of the  year, clinging to its long-term uptrend.  But with plenty to prove before  investors can be sure that this was just a routine correction or that it's  over.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And as bond yields head higher, the Federal Reserve Governor Lael  Brainard today said the economy is strengthening and appears capable of  withstanding gradual interest rate increases.  She's also pleased to see  inflation moving towards the central bank's target.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAE:  Today, actually, inflation is moving more in line with what one would  expect at this point.  And, in fact, there I think, you know, we are  looking carefully at inflation and expecting to see it move towards target  in line with our objectives.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  So with inflation and interest rates ticking higher, how can  investors protect their money and maybe even profit?  </p><p>Bob Pisani did some digging.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Can you protect  yourself against inflation and higher rates?  In the last several years,  the ETF business has expanded dramatically, with more than 2,000 products  in all corners of the market.  With rates moving up and inflation issues  prominent, is it possible to purchase products that benefit from inflation?   You can, but it's tricky.  </p><p>One of the beneficiaries of inflation concerns has been commodities.  So,  oil stocks and steel and aluminum producers.  Fortunately, there are ways  to play the trend.  Oil and gas exploration and production ETF, XOP is the  simple, is a basket of companies that explore for oil and gas.  It's up  over 10 percent this month.</p><p>And you can play this in an even broader way, the VanEck natural resources  ETF, symbol HAP, invest in oil and gas producers but also mining and  agribusiness stocks.  It's up 4 percent.  </p><p>You can even get more exotic.  How about timber?  PowerShares global timber  ETF, the symbol is CUT.  Invest in timber companies, like Weyerhaeuser  (NYSE:WY), an international paper.  Why?  The theory is that timber-related  products have been seen as hedges against inflation in the past.  </p><p>Now, commodities are not the only play on inflation.  Some are buying  variable rate loans which rise as interest rates rise.  Using ETFs like the  PowerShares senior loan portfolio, the symbol is BKLN.  Others are trying  to short treasury bonds using ETFs.  This is a further bet essentially that  interest rates will rise.  </p><p>A lot of choices out there.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The rise in bond yields means mortgage rates are going up.  And as  Diana Olick reports, the timing couldn't be worse for a housing market  that's already facing a number of headwinds.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Buying a home just got  a little more expensive.  And this is a big weekend for buyers as real  estate agencies and home builders are running big spring promotions and  sales.  Mortgage rates which loosely follow the yield on the ten-year  treasury hit their highest level yesterday since the end of March, breaking  out of a tight range where they've been sitting for a while.  </p><p>The move came as bond yields surged higher, while the increase won't mean a  ton in terms of the average monthly payment for a homebuyer, it could be  signaling the start of another steady rise, which we saw at the start of  this year.  And that can take an emotional toll not just on buyers but on  sellers as well.  As rates rise, fewer homeowners will want to sell and buy  another home because they would likely be giving up record low rates in the  3 percent range to move and pay on a rate closer to 5 percent.  </p><p>The entire nation is in the midst of a supply crisis and home builders are  not ramping up as much as hoped because of higher costs for materials and a  labor shortage.  That's just pushing home prices ever higher.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  General Electric (NYSE:GE) was the best performing stock on the  blue chip Dow index and it's been a while since we've been able to say  that.  This, after the company reported earnings and revenue that exceed  expectations.  The CEO says the quarter represents a step forward in that  company's turnaround.  Investors breathed a sigh of relief, sending shares  up nearly 4 percent.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on GE's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Dow's oldest  component reporting earnings that beat expectations and it reaffirmed its  outlook for a full-year profit and cash flow.  On a conference call with  analyst, the GE CEO and chairman John Flannery calling the results his  first report card, saying, quote, we see signs of progress.  </p><p>JOHN FLANNERY, GENERAL ELECTRIC CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  There's no change to our  framework of $1 to $1.07 earnings per share with $67 billion of free cash  flow.  We expect earnings pressure in power will be offset by better  aviation and better health care earnings and lower corporate costs.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Flannery, who took the helm last August and has been aggressively  cutting costs.  He's also moving forward with billions of dollars worth of  divestitures.  Including a locomotive's unit and GE's iconic lighting  business.  The updates were welcomed by Wall Street because after a month  of disclosures, charges and negative revisions, no news has become good  news.  </p><p>STEVEN WINOKER, UBS:  I think what they're going to be able to do is look  back on 2018 as the bottom, right, and 2019, even if power markets don't  recover, they're finding a way to take costs out in an aggressive way, to  still drive margin expansion, despite weak power markets.  And that's  really the trick as well as looking at the portfolio little more  objectively.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  When it comes to that portfolio, Flannery again saying all  options are on the table, for the bigger update of the long-term future of  the industrial conglomerate, expected in the coming months.  </p><p>Next on tap, the company will host its shareholder meeting next week to  bring in new directors to its corporate board.  Meantime, G.E. stock did  finish the day higher.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan at the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Twitter was upgraded to buy from neutral at MKM Partners.  The analyst  cites factors including user growth and Twitter's mass market potential.   The price target was increased to $40.  Twitter shares rose 1 percent to  $31.91.  </p><p>Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI (NASDAQ:TBUS)) was upgraded to outperform from  market perform at Bernstein.  The analyst expects Darden's Olive Garden  Restaurants to perform well and cites long-term margin expansion.  The  price target is $105 per share.  The shares were up more than 1 percent to  $91.05.  </p><p>Tractor Supplies rating was raised to overweight from neutral at Piper  Jaffray.  The analyst there citing improving business trends in the  agricultural industry.  The firm's price target on the specialty retailer  is $72 a share.  The stock rose just a fraction to $60.33.  </p><p>Still ahead, 'tis the season for sneezing and sniffling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Spring is here and  that means allergy season is upon us.  Coming up, a look at why your  allergies may be getting worse and at the big business of allergy medicine.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  As many as 1.5 million SunTrust customers may have had their data  compromised after an employee stole client contract lists.  SunTrust CEO  said the employee who has since left that company was working with a  criminal third party when those lists were taken.  Separately, the bank  reported earnings which topped expectations.  </p><p>Last night, we told you that regulators were close to finding Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) $1 billion for forcing customers into car insurance and charging  mortgage borrowers unfair fees.  Today, that record fine became official.   The bank will pay $5 million to the comptroller of the currency and $500  million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The fine is the  largest ever imposed by the CFPB.  </p><p>The Justice Department has reportedly opened an antitrust probe into  potential collusion between AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).  According  to \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT),\" regulators allege the companies worked  together to make it more difficult for consumers to switch wireless  carriers.  The investigation was opened five months ago.  Both Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) fell on this down market day.  Other reports  said Sprint and T-Mobile also received requests from the Department of  Justice.  </p><p>One of China's top telecom companies is crying foul over the U.S.  government's decision to ban American firms from providing components or  software to ZTE.  As we reported, the ban was imposed this week by the  Commerce Department.  And as Eunice Yoon reports, ZTE is making its  opposition known.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  ZTE's chairman called  a press conference today to protest a seven-year ban imposed by the U.S.  Commerce Department.  The ban blocks American companies from selling  components to the Chinese smartphone maker.  ZTE pled guilty last year for  violating U.S. sanctions by supplying to Iran.  The company agreed to pay a  hefty fine of $900 million and could take steps against the employees  involved.  </p><p>At the press conference, the chairman admitted to being slow to fulfilling  the settlement but said the punishment didn't match the crime.  Such  sanctions could put the company into a coma, he said.  We resolutely oppose  such an unfair, unreasonable punishments and especially the act of  politicizing trade.  </p><p>The smartphone maker said it would use all legal means necessary to  safeguard its rights.  There are two competing reactions in China to ZTE's  case.  One is the attempt to whip up national sentiment to support the  company and China's high-tech industry.  In the state media, \"The China  Daily\" ran a headline that read p reads the U.S. action against ZTE aims to  hit China's 5G advantages.  </p><p>At the same time, the case has shaken up some people here about the dangers  of getting into a trade war with the United States because they realize  that the U.S. makes a lot of products that the Chinese need.  </p><p>On social media, one user said, from this I learned how big a gap there is  between China and the U.S. in tech development.  Another says only when you  have high tech can you have a say.  </p><p>Experts here have been calling for China to speed up its efforts to develop  its own homegrown chip industry.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Honeywell hikes its forecast for the second time this year.  And  that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>A strong quarter helped by strength in the company's aerospace business  prompted Honeywell to raise its guidance for 2018.  Honeywell also said  it's taking aggressive action to mitigate any negative impact caused from  the new tarries on imported steel and aluminum.  Shares rose 1-1/2 percent  to $150.57.  </p><p>Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) topped sales expectations but investors  were disappointed to see a drop in quarterly profit and a weaker full-year  outlook.  The tools maker said the new guidance was result of an  acquisition and a tax charge.  Shares finished down more than 6 percent  to144.21.  </p><p>Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) said strength in nearly all of its divisions helped  earnings and revenue top expectations.  The oil field services company also  warned the industry will face supply challenges this year and will need new  investments to offset a shortage.  Shares of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) fell  about 1.5 percent to $69.23.  </p><p>And the activist hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a 9 percent stake in  pinnacle food, saying it plans to talk to the owner of Birds Eye and Duncan  Hines brands about exploring a potential sale.  Jana also plans to nominate  new directors and suggest ways that Pinnacle can cut costs.  Shares of  Pinnacle Foods jumped nearly 10 percent to $60.58.  </p><p>HERERA:  It is time now for our weekly market monitor who has names of  stocks he says are the number one winners of the digital economy.  The last  time he was on back in October, he liked Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is  down 5 percent, Esperion Therapeutics, which is up 55 percent, and Wave  Life Sciences, which is 96 percent higher.  </p><p>Joining us is Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities.  </p><p>Welcome back.  Nice to see you, Mark.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Sue.  Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA:  And congratulations on a couple of those picks.  We think that's  terrific that you're giving our viewers that kind of advice.  </p><p>Let's start with -- you're talking about the digital economy.  And there  have been a number of challenges in the digital economy lately.  And some  of it involves one of your picks which we'll get to in a second.  </p><p>But you like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  A lot of people think Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) has run pretty far, pretty fast.  </p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, they're right and it has been in the news as of late.  And  it has run a lot.  But it's one of those names I think you want to  continually watch.  If you have an opportunity like we've had when it was  in the news for other reasons and you got a chance at much lower than it is  today, that's when you want to pay attention.  </p><p>It has moved a lot.  It's a volatile name.  And when you have volatility,  you have an opportunity potentially to buy it at a much more reasonable  price when you think the fundamentals won't change and I think that's why  Amazon's the top of our list here at JMP Securities.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK, the one stock that has always been in the news I was referring  to a second ago is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  You're taking a bit of a  contrarian view on this one.  </p><p>LEHMANN:  We are.  And it has been in the news as of late.  Everybody knows  Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress.  But the stock I think is  much more reasonably priced, despite all the headlines and all the headline  risk.  I think there will be some regulation.  I think they'll be some  self-regulation that I think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will go through.  </p><p>But the juggernaut that they have with the consumers and the juggernaut  they have with advertisers, I don't think it's going to change.  And I  think you have a stock at a much more attractive valuation.  I think you  need to ignore some of the noise you'll get with the current quarter and  know that you're still buying a winner at less than 20 times earnings and  that's a stock again that I think is the winner in the digital economy.   And you got a chance to buy it cheaper, you should.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK, but as an investor, you need to be aware there may be some  headline risk with that name, right?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  Absolutely, and I think, you know, you probably haven't heard the  last of it.  I think there's definitely more of self-awareness they're  going through.  But I'd pick Mark Zuckerberg and his teammates any day.   And I think the juggernaut that they have with their couple billion users  and their million daily active users you want to be a part of.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  We'll wrap it up with Zillow Group.  Why do you like it?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  It's another company that's at the top of their game in terms of  the sector they're in of the real estate market.  It has gone through a  little bit of consternation as of late.  They talked about expanding some  of the breadth of their products lately.  It's caused the stock to  deteriorate a little bit from its recent highs.  </p><p>But it is the number one brand in that sector, in the real estate market.   All the consumers know that name.  I think if they continue to expand their  offering, it's more reasonably priced today, and I think nine months down  the road, you're going to want to own that stock.  Here at attractive  levels, it's a good entry point.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  We'll leave it at that, Mark, thanks so much.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Mark Lehmann with JMP securities.  And you can read more about his  stock picks on our Website which is NBR.com.  </p><p>Well, it is spring, and as the temperatures rise, so does the pollen count.   And that means millions of people will turn to allergy medicines to  alleviate their sneezing and sniffling and watery eyes.  And that is big  business for a number of companies.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Each spring, the  National Cherry Blossom Festival draws more than 1 million visitors to  Washington, D.C.  Visitors like 74-year-old Sandra Czarkowski, who loves  the view but hated the way it made her feel.  </p><p>SANDRA CZARKOWSKI, ALLERGY SUFFERER:  It's deceptive when you see something  so beautiful and it really knocks you right over.  You can't sleep.  You  can't breathe.  But I cope.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Czarkowski is one of 50 million Americans who suffer from  seasonal allergies which cause irritating symptoms like stuffy nose and  itchy ice but also more serious effects from coughing and wheezing to  asthma attacks.  Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist at NYU says seasonal  allergies are getting more severe.  </p><p>DR. PURVI PARIKH, NYU ALLERGIST:  Climate change is a big reason for that,  because our carbon dioxide levels are now higher, the pollen is much more  potent and the plants are almost producing super pollen and the seasons are  much longer.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Allergy medicines are big business for the pharmaceutical  industry, drawing more than $2.6 billion in U.S. revenue in the last year,  according to data from Nielsen.  That's just for over the counter products  like J&amp;J Zyrtec, GlaxoSmithKline's Flonase and Bayer's Claritin, and  doesn't include prescription medicines.  </p><p>The cost for consumers can add up.  </p><p>Sandra Czarkowski uses a prescription inhaler that she says costs her $50  out of pocket.  </p><p>CZARKOWSKI:  There are people that cannot get relief because they can't pay  the price.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  But for her and other allergy sufferers like this 26-year-old  student and waitress Jessica Fuentes, going without allergy medications is  not an option.  </p><p>JESSICA FUENTES, ALLERGY SUFFERER:  I'm just going to be like waterfall of  just all over the place I guess.  It's, yes, it's an uncomfortable feeling.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Here's wishing everyone a less sniffly spring.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell from the New York Botanical  Garden, Bronx, New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the new ways to get to space.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN:  I'm Morgan Brennan in Colorado Springs.  It is the biggest space  conference of the year and one of the hottest topics, blue origin's rocket  engines.  We catch up with the space company created by Jeff Bezos to talk  about space tourism, its next generation rocket and technology.  That's  coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Here's a look at what to watch next week.  On Tuesday, Dow  components 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) will report quarterly results.  On Wednesday, we'll hear from  blue chip Boeing (NYSE:BA).  And on Friday, a look at how much the economy  grew in the first quarter.  And that is what to watch for next week.  </p><p>President Trump criticized OPEC and the cartel's role in pushing up oil  prices.  He wrote, quote: Looks like OPEC is at it again.  With record  amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea,  oil prices are artificially very high.  No good and will not be accepted,  end quote.  </p><p>That tweet sent oil prices lower earlier in the day, but they recovered and  settled slightly higher.  </p><p>OPEC's secretary-general has said that the organization does not have a  price objective but is working to restore stability to the oil markets.  </p><p>The FAA is issuing an emergency directive, ordering inspections of more jet  engines like the one involved in the fatal Southwest accident.  The new  order goes beyond what was previously proposed.  Engines with the high  number of takeoffs and landings must complete inspections within 20 days.   European regulators are also issuing a similar order.  </p><p>Private American companies are competing to become leaders in the new space  race and in the process, phase out our reliance on Russian parts.  One of  those companies is Blue Origin.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan is back with us tonight, filing this report from Colorado  Springs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN:  Meet Blue Origin's new rocket engine, the BE-4.  It represents a  crucial step toward intergalactic dominance but it's also a matter of  national security.  </p><p>I think a lot of Americans don't realize that some of the most sensitive  security and military missions right now in terms of space are being  powered by Russian-made rockets.  So, this actually represents really kind  of a shift in terms of American manufacturing.  </p><p>What's the opportunity there?  </p><p>BOB SMITH, BLUE ORIGIN CEO:  The opportunity has to do to replace those  rockets and get on to American rockets, buying American payloads.  So, it's  exciting actually to do that.  This is something we developed with our own  dollars, so we're excited about the commercial opportunities that that's  going to give us.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Bob Smith is the CEO of Blue Origins, space startup created by  Amazon's Jeff Bezos.  </p><p>At the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Smith sowed off the new  technology, in his first on-camera interview since taking the helm last  year.  </p><p>SMITH:  We spent so much time in development.  That's over seven years  developing this engine to make it reusable.  This engine will actually  perform 100 starts, and 100 formations that we'd actually be able to go do.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The company develops the engine for its own rockets which are  expected to begin launching satellites and other payloads into orbit as  soon as 2020.  But the company also hopes to sell them to United Launch  Alliance or ULA.  The industry consortium owned by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).  </p><p>ULA currently relies on Russian engines.  Lawmakers want those phased out.   So, ULA is developing its own new rockets.</p><p>TORY BRUNO, UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  We're going to fly  Vulcan in the middle of 2020.  We're so excited about that.  We'll begin  introducing reusability elements just a couple of two, three years later.   And then full new technologies in an advance upper stage.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Blue Origin is competing against Aerojet Rocketdyne to build the  engine for the Vulcan.  A contract its expected to win when the decision is  announced, quote, soon.  </p><p>Smith says it will mean a new revenue stream and fit into a broader  strategy taken from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook.  </p><p>SMITH: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) goes and builds capabilities, builds  capabilities, gains some customer base and continues to build on that.   We're going to do the same kind of strategy of building capability after  capability and making sure we get customer adoption as we go along.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Blue Origin is already courting customers for its own rocket and  its space terrorism ambitions plans to carry paying passengers past the  edge of space could take flight as soon as this year.  It all speaks to the  unprecedented role the private sector's playing in this new space race.  As  billionaire visions now become realities.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think we'll have obviously flying space tourists.  We'll be  flying several payloads as well.  We'll be I think the pre-eminent engine  provider in the country.  We'll also have our new vehicle that we'll be  using not only for civil and commercial but financial security payloads as  well.  So, I think at that point, we will be in very much the position we  want to be as we stand in today.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Colorado  Springs.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And before we go, here's a look at the day and the week on Wall  Street.  The Dow fell 201 points.  The Nasdaq was off 91.  And the S&amp;P 500  lost 22.  For the week, the major indices were all fractionally higher.  </p><p>And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great weekend, everybody.  We will  see you right back here on Monday.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks drop sharply to end the week as bond yields rise and investors try to figure out what`s next for this market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Electric results.

Allergy season is in full bloom and that is big business for some major drug companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, April 20th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. I`m Sue Herera. Bill Griffeth is off tonight.</p><p>It was a rough way to end the week. Stocks fell sharply as bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year hit its highest level since 2014.</p><p>Apple`s four percent drop dragged the technology sector lower after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) said it expects the company`s iPhone sales to disappoint. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrials Average fell 201 points to 24,462. The Nasdaq was off 91 and the S&amp;P 500 lost 22.</p><p>Despite today`s declines, stocks were higher for the week. And now that we`re a few months into an unusual year on Wall Street, many are trying to figure out what happens next.</p><p>So, Mike Santoli went looking for some answers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The stock market finds itself once again at a crossroads. Nearly three months after reaching a peak, the S&amp;P 500 index is about flat for the year and roughly halfway between that record high and the low of early February. Volatility readings have come down sharply as the market has stabilized. Yet the indexes remain far jumpier than they were all of last year.</p><p>Corporate earnings are quite strong, even better than lofty forecasts. Yet investors are not rewarded good results for higher share prices across the board. The market`s indecision reflects several factors. Tax cuts and a surging global economy are enriching companies and helping consumers, yet those same factors are pushing interest rates higher. The 10-year treasury has climbed back to 2.95 percent, its high for the year and the level last seen two months ago. The S&amp;P has been caught near or below its current level each time bond yields have been this close to 3 percent.</p><p>A surge in oil and other commodity prices and reports of upward pressure on wages have revived inflation concerns and boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will look to raise short-term rates several more times in the next couple of years. And concerns about big tech stock valuation and the risk of hostile regulations for powerful Silicon Valley companies have slowed this sector, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500`s value.</p><p>While these factors have kept stocks in this neutral zone, the market has made progress on some front. The indexes have held above those February lows throughout all the trade war and political noise of recent months. The valuation of the market has also come down nicely as stock prices have stagnated, while earnings have grown fast.</p><p>And investor sentiment is a good deal more subdued than it was in January which is usually a necessary condition for stocks forming a durable base. Taken together, it means t market is approaching the one-third point of the year, clinging to its long-term uptrend. But with plenty to prove before investors can be sure that this was just a routine correction or that it`s over.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And as bond yields head higher, the Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard today said the economy is strengthening and appears capable of withstanding gradual interest rate increases. She`s also pleased to see inflation moving towards the central bank`s target.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAE: Today, actually, inflation is moving more in line with what one would expect at this point. And, in fact, there I think, you know, we are looking carefully at inflation and expecting to see it move towards target in line with our objectives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: So with inflation and interest rates ticking higher, how can investors protect their money and maybe even profit?</p><p>Bob Pisani did some digging.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Can you protect yourself against inflation and higher rates? In the last several years, the ETF business has expanded dramatically, with more than 2,000 products in all corners of the market. With rates moving up and inflation issues prominent, is it possible to purchase products that benefit from inflation? You can, but it`s tricky.</p><p>One of the beneficiaries of inflation concerns has been commodities. So, oil stocks and steel and aluminum producers. Fortunately, there are ways to play the trend. Oil and gas exploration and production ETF, XOP is the simple, is a basket of companies that explore for oil and gas. It`s up over 10 percent this month.</p><p>And you can play this in an even broader way, the VanEck natural resources ETF, symbol HAP, invest in oil and gas producers but also mining and agribusiness stocks. It`s up 4 percent.</p><p>You can even get more exotic. How about timber? PowerShares global timber ETF, the symbol is CUT. Invest in timber companies, like Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY), an international paper. Why? The theory is that timber-related products have been seen as hedges against inflation in the past.</p><p>Now, commodities are not the only play on inflation. Some are buying variable rate loans which rise as interest rates rise. Using ETFs like the PowerShares senior loan portfolio, the symbol is BKLN. Others are trying to short treasury bonds using ETFs. This is a further bet essentially that interest rates will rise.</p><p>A lot of choices out there.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The rise in bond yields means mortgage rates are going up. And as Diana Olick reports, the timing couldn`t be worse for a housing market that`s already facing a number of headwinds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Buying a home just got a little more expensive. And this is a big weekend for buyers as real estate agencies and home builders are running big spring promotions and sales. Mortgage rates which loosely follow the yield on the ten-year treasury hit their highest level yesterday since the end of March, breaking out of a tight range where they`ve been sitting for a while.</p><p>The move came as bond yields surged higher, while the increase won`t mean a ton in terms of the average monthly payment for a homebuyer, it could be signaling the start of another steady rise, which we saw at the start of this year. And that can take an emotional toll not just on buyers but on sellers as well. As rates rise, fewer homeowners will want to sell and buy another home because they would likely be giving up record low rates in the 3 percent range to move and pay on a rate closer to 5 percent.</p><p>The entire nation is in the midst of a supply crisis and home builders are not ramping up as much as hoped because of higher costs for materials and a labor shortage. That`s just pushing home prices ever higher.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: General Electric (NYSE:GE) was the best performing stock on the blue chip Dow index and it`s been a while since we`ve been able to say that. This, after the company reported earnings and revenue that exceed expectations. The CEO says the quarter represents a step forward in that company`s turnaround. Investors breathed a sigh of relief, sending shares up nearly 4 percent.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on GE`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Dow`s oldest component reporting earnings that beat expectations and it reaffirmed its outlook for a full-year profit and cash flow. On a conference call with analyst, the GE CEO and chairman John Flannery calling the results his first report card, saying, quote, we see signs of progress.</p><p>JOHN FLANNERY, GENERAL ELECTRIC CHAIRMAN AND CEO: There`s no change to our framework of $1 to $1.07 earnings per share with $67 billion of free cash flow. We expect earnings pressure in power will be offset by better aviation and better health care earnings and lower corporate costs.</p><p>BRENNAN: Flannery, who took the helm last August and has been aggressively cutting costs. He`s also moving forward with billions of dollars worth of divestitures. Including a locomotive`s unit and GE`s iconic lighting business. The updates were welcomed by Wall Street because after a month of disclosures, charges and negative revisions, no news has become good news.</p><p>STEVEN WINOKER, UBS: I think what they`re going to be able to do is look back on 2018 as the bottom, right, and 2019, even if power markets don`t recover, they`re finding a way to take costs out in an aggressive way, to still drive margin expansion, despite weak power markets. And that`s really the trick as well as looking at the portfolio little more objectively.</p><p>BRENNAN: When it comes to that portfolio, Flannery again saying all options are on the table, for the bigger update of the long-term future of the industrial conglomerate, expected in the coming months.</p><p>Next on tap, the company will host its shareholder meeting next week to bring in new directors to its corporate board. Meantime, G.E. stock did finish the day higher.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Twitter was upgraded to buy from neutral at MKM Partners. The analyst cites factors including user growth and Twitter`s mass market potential. The price target was increased to $40. Twitter shares rose 1 percent to $31.91.</p><p>Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI (NASDAQ:TBUS)) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Bernstein. The analyst expects Darden`s Olive Garden Restaurants to perform well and cites long-term margin expansion. The price target is $105 per share. The shares were up more than 1 percent to $91.05.</p><p>Tractor Supplies rating was raised to overweight from neutral at Piper Jaffray. The analyst there citing improving business trends in the agricultural industry. The firm`s price target on the specialty retailer is $72 a share. The stock rose just a fraction to $60.33.</p><p>Still ahead, `tis the season for sneezing and sniffling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Spring is here and that means allergy season is upon us. Coming up, a look at why your allergies may be getting worse and at the big business of allergy medicine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: As many as 1.5 million SunTrust customers may have had their data compromised after an employee stole client contract lists. SunTrust CEO said the employee who has since left that company was working with a criminal third party when those lists were taken. Separately, the bank reported earnings which topped expectations.</p><p>Last night, we told you that regulators were close to finding Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $1 billion for forcing customers into car insurance and charging mortgage borrowers unfair fees. Today, that record fine became official. The bank will pay $5 million to the comptroller of the currency and $500 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The fine is the largest ever imposed by the CFPB.</p><p>The Justice Department has reportedly opened an antitrust probe into potential collusion between AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). According to \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT),\" regulators allege the companies worked together to make it more difficult for consumers to switch wireless carriers. The investigation was opened five months ago. Both Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) fell on this down market day. Other reports said Sprint and T-Mobile also received requests from the Department of Justice.</p><p>One of China`s top telecom companies is crying foul over the U.S. government`s decision to ban American firms from providing components or software to ZTE. As we reported, the ban was imposed this week by the Commerce Department. And as Eunice Yoon reports, ZTE is making its opposition known.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: ZTE`s chairman called a press conference today to protest a seven-year ban imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department. The ban blocks American companies from selling components to the Chinese smartphone maker. ZTE pled guilty last year for violating U.S. sanctions by supplying to Iran. The company agreed to pay a hefty fine of $900 million and could take steps against the employees involved.</p><p>At the press conference, the chairman admitted to being slow to fulfilling the settlement but said the punishment didn`t match the crime. Such sanctions could put the company into a coma, he said. We resolutely oppose such an unfair, unreasonable punishments and especially the act of politicizing trade.</p><p>The smartphone maker said it would use all legal means necessary to safeguard its rights. There are two competing reactions in China to ZTE`s case. One is the attempt to whip up national sentiment to support the company and China`s high-tech industry. In the state media, \"The China Daily\" ran a headline that read p reads the U.S. action against ZTE aims to hit China`s 5G advantages.</p><p>At the same time, the case has shaken up some people here about the dangers of getting into a trade war with the United States because they realize that the U.S. makes a lot of products that the Chinese need.</p><p>On social media, one user said, from this I learned how big a gap there is between China and the U.S. in tech development. Another says only when you have high tech can you have a say.</p><p>Experts here have been calling for China to speed up its efforts to develop its own homegrown chip industry.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Honeywell hikes its forecast for the second time this year. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>A strong quarter helped by strength in the company`s aerospace business prompted Honeywell to raise its guidance for 2018. Honeywell also said it`s taking aggressive action to mitigate any negative impact caused from the new tarries on imported steel and aluminum. Shares rose 1-1/2 percent to $150.57.</p><p>Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) topped sales expectations but investors were disappointed to see a drop in quarterly profit and a weaker full-year outlook. The tools maker said the new guidance was result of an acquisition and a tax charge. Shares finished down more than 6 percent to144.21.</p><p>Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) said strength in nearly all of its divisions helped earnings and revenue top expectations. The oil field services company also warned the industry will face supply challenges this year and will need new investments to offset a shortage. Shares of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) fell about 1.5 percent to $69.23.</p><p>And the activist hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a 9 percent stake in pinnacle food, saying it plans to talk to the owner of Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands about exploring a potential sale. Jana also plans to nominate new directors and suggest ways that Pinnacle can cut costs. Shares of Pinnacle Foods jumped nearly 10 percent to $60.58.</p><p>HERERA: It is time now for our weekly market monitor who has names of stocks he says are the number one winners of the digital economy. The last time he was on back in October, he liked Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is down 5 percent, Esperion Therapeutics, which is up 55 percent, and Wave Life Sciences, which is 96 percent higher.</p><p>Joining us is Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities.</p><p>Welcome back. Nice to see you, Mark.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT: Thanks, Sue. Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA: And congratulations on a couple of those picks. We think that`s terrific that you`re giving our viewers that kind of advice.</p><p>Let`s start with -- you`re talking about the digital economy. And there have been a number of challenges in the digital economy lately. And some of it involves one of your picks which we`ll get to in a second.</p><p>But you like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). A lot of people think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has run pretty far, pretty fast.</p><p>LEHMANN: Well, they`re right and it has been in the news as of late. And it has run a lot. But it`s one of those names I think you want to continually watch. If you have an opportunity like we`ve had when it was in the news for other reasons and you got a chance at much lower than it is today, that`s when you want to pay attention.</p><p>It has moved a lot. It`s a volatile name. And when you have volatility, you have an opportunity potentially to buy it at a much more reasonable price when you think the fundamentals won`t change and I think that`s why Amazon`s the top of our list here at JMP Securities.</p><p>HERERA: OK, the one stock that has always been in the news I was referring to a second ago is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). You`re taking a bit of a contrarian view on this one.</p><p>LEHMANN: We are. And it has been in the news as of late. Everybody knows Mark Zuckerberg`s testimony in front of Congress. But the stock I think is much more reasonably priced, despite all the headlines and all the headline risk. I think there will be some regulation. I think they`ll be some self-regulation that I think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will go through.</p><p>But the juggernaut that they have with the consumers and the juggernaut they have with advertisers, I don`t think it`s going to change. And I think you have a stock at a much more attractive valuation. I think you need to ignore some of the noise you`ll get with the current quarter and know that you`re still buying a winner at less than 20 times earnings and that`s a stock again that I think is the winner in the digital economy. And you got a chance to buy it cheaper, you should.</p><p>HERERA: OK, but as an investor, you need to be aware there may be some headline risk with that name, right?</p><p>LEHMANN: Absolutely, and I think, you know, you probably haven`t heard the last of it. I think there`s definitely more of self-awareness they`re going through. But I`d pick Mark Zuckerberg and his teammates any day. And I think the juggernaut that they have with their couple billion users and their million daily active users you want to be a part of.</p><p>HERERA: OK. We`ll wrap it up with Zillow Group. Why do you like it?</p><p>LEHMANN: It`s another company that`s at the top of their game in terms of the sector they`re in of the real estate market. It has gone through a little bit of consternation as of late. They talked about expanding some of the breadth of their products lately. It`s caused the stock to deteriorate a little bit from its recent highs.</p><p>But it is the number one brand in that sector, in the real estate market. All the consumers know that name. I think if they continue to expand their offering, it`s more reasonably priced today, and I think nine months down the road, you`re going to want to own that stock. Here at attractive levels, it`s a good entry point.</p><p>HERERA: All right. We`ll leave it at that, Mark, thanks so much.</p><p>LEHMANN: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Mark Lehmann with JMP securities. And you can read more about his stock picks on our Website which is NBR.com.</p><p>Well, it is spring, and as the temperatures rise, so does the pollen count. And that means millions of people will turn to allergy medicines to alleviate their sneezing and sniffling and watery eyes. And that is big business for a number of companies.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Each spring, the National Cherry Blossom Festival draws more than 1 million visitors to Washington, D.C. Visitors like 74-year-old Sandra Czarkowski, who loves the view but hated the way it made her feel.</p><p>SANDRA CZARKOWSKI, ALLERGY SUFFERER: It`s deceptive when you see something so beautiful and it really knocks you right over. You can`t sleep. You can`t breathe. But I cope.</p><p>TIRRELL: Czarkowski is one of 50 million Americans who suffer from seasonal allergies which cause irritating symptoms like stuffy nose and itchy ice but also more serious effects from coughing and wheezing to asthma attacks. Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist at NYU says seasonal allergies are getting more severe.</p><p>DR. PURVI PARIKH, NYU ALLERGIST: Climate change is a big reason for that, because our carbon dioxide levels are now higher, the pollen is much more potent and the plants are almost producing super pollen and the seasons are much longer.</p><p>TIRRELL: Allergy medicines are big business for the pharmaceutical industry, drawing more than $2.6 billion in U.S. revenue in the last year, according to data from Nielsen. That`s just for over the counter products like J&amp;J Zyrtec, GlaxoSmithKline`s Flonase and Bayer`s Claritin, and doesn`t include prescription medicines.</p><p>The cost for consumers can add up.</p><p>Sandra Czarkowski uses a prescription inhaler that she says costs her $50 out of pocket.</p><p>CZARKOWSKI: There are people that cannot get relief because they can`t pay the price.</p><p>TIRRELL: But for her and other allergy sufferers like this 26-year-old student and waitress Jessica Fuentes, going without allergy medications is not an option.</p><p>JESSICA FUENTES, ALLERGY SUFFERER: I`m just going to be like waterfall of just all over the place I guess. It`s, yes, it`s an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p>TIRRELL: Here`s wishing everyone a less sniffly spring.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell from the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the new ways to get to space.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: I`m Morgan Brennan in Colorado Springs. It is the biggest space conference of the year and one of the hottest topics, blue origin`s rocket engines. We catch up with the space company created by Jeff Bezos to talk about space tourism, its next generation rocket and technology. That`s coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Here`s a look at what to watch next week. On Tuesday, Dow components 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will report quarterly results. On Wednesday, we`ll hear from blue chip Boeing (NYSE:BA). And on Friday, a look at how much the economy grew in the first quarter. And that is what to watch for next week.</p><p>President Trump criticized OPEC and the cartel`s role in pushing up oil prices. He wrote, quote: Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, oil prices are artificially very high. No good and will not be accepted, end quote.</p><p>That tweet sent oil prices lower earlier in the day, but they recovered and settled slightly higher.</p><p>OPEC`s secretary-general has said that the organization does not have a price objective but is working to restore stability to the oil markets.</p><p>The FAA is issuing an emergency directive, ordering inspections of more jet engines like the one involved in the fatal Southwest accident. The new order goes beyond what was previously proposed. Engines with the high number of takeoffs and landings must complete inspections within 20 days. European regulators are also issuing a similar order.</p><p>Private American companies are competing to become leaders in the new space race and in the process, phase out our reliance on Russian parts. One of those companies is Blue Origin.</p><p>Morgan Brennan is back with us tonight, filing this report from Colorado Springs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: Meet Blue Origin`s new rocket engine, the BE-4. It represents a crucial step toward intergalactic dominance but it`s also a matter of national security.</p><p>I think a lot of Americans don`t realize that some of the most sensitive security and military missions right now in terms of space are being powered by Russian-made rockets. So, this actually represents really kind of a shift in terms of American manufacturing.</p><p>What`s the opportunity there?</p><p>BOB SMITH, BLUE ORIGIN CEO: The opportunity has to do to replace those rockets and get on to American rockets, buying American payloads. So, it`s exciting actually to do that. This is something we developed with our own dollars, so we`re excited about the commercial opportunities that that`s going to give us.</p><p>BRENNAN: Bob Smith is the CEO of Blue Origins, space startup created by Amazon`s Jeff Bezos.</p><p>At the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Smith sowed off the new technology, in his first on-camera interview since taking the helm last year.</p><p>SMITH: We spent so much time in development. That`s over seven years developing this engine to make it reusable. This engine will actually perform 100 starts, and 100 formations that we`d actually be able to go do.</p><p>BRENNAN: The company develops the engine for its own rockets which are expected to begin launching satellites and other payloads into orbit as soon as 2020. But the company also hopes to sell them to United Launch Alliance or ULA. The industry consortium owned by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).</p><p>ULA currently relies on Russian engines. Lawmakers want those phased out. So, ULA is developing its own new rockets.</p><p>TORY BRUNO, UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: We`re going to fly Vulcan in the middle of 2020. We`re so excited about that. We`ll begin introducing reusability elements just a couple of two, three years later. And then full new technologies in an advance upper stage.</p><p>BRENNAN: Blue Origin is competing against Aerojet Rocketdyne to build the engine for the Vulcan. A contract its expected to win when the decision is announced, quote, soon.</p><p>Smith says it will mean a new revenue stream and fit into a broader strategy taken from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook.</p><p>SMITH: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) goes and builds capabilities, builds capabilities, gains some customer base and continues to build on that. We`re going to do the same kind of strategy of building capability after capability and making sure we get customer adoption as we go along.</p><p>BRENNAN: Blue Origin is already courting customers for its own rocket and its space terrorism ambitions plans to carry paying passengers past the edge of space could take flight as soon as this year. It all speaks to the unprecedented role the private sector`s playing in this new space race. As billionaire visions now become realities.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think we`ll have obviously flying space tourists. We`ll be flying several payloads as well. We`ll be I think the pre-eminent engine provider in the country. We`ll also have our new vehicle that we`ll be using not only for civil and commercial but financial security payloads as well. So, I think at that point, we will be in very much the position we want to be as we stand in today.</p><p>BRENNAN: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan in Colorado Springs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, here`s a look at the day and the week on Wall Street. The Dow fell 201 points. The Nasdaq was off 91. And the S&amp;P 500 lost 22. For the week, the major indices were all fractionally higher.</p><p>And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us. Have a great weekend, everybody.

The NASDAQ finally closes at a record, topping its dot-com era  high.  And tech earnings tonight, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could set the tone for tomorrow.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Message to the market.   What Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG),  three of the world's biggest global companies, are saying about the health  of the world economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GRIFFETH:  And why this earnings season is turning out to be a big one  for small caps.</p><p>  All of that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, April the 23rd.  </p><p>  Good evening, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Bill Griffeth, in tonight  for Tyler Mathisen.  </p><p>  HERERA:  And I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>  The NASDAQ closed at an all-time high.  We'll have more on that  momentarily.  </p><p>  But we begin tonight with three of the world's biggest companies and  what they are saying about the global economy.  </p><p>  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the maker of construction and mining  equipment, which reaches more than 180 countries, blew past earnings  estimates.  But it also issued a warning.  </p><p>  Procter and Gamble, the world's largest household product firms which  touched consumers across the global said revenues fell from last year, a  sign of weakening demand and perhaps something else.  </p><p>  And 3M (NYSE:MMM), a manufacturing conglomerate, cut its full year  outlook.  </p><p>  Together these three companies are sending a message to the markets  about the global economy.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA (voice-over):  Giant multinationals, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M  (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), all Dow components, are feeling  the effects of a stronger dollar, the freefall in oil prices, and  geopolitical uncertainties.  </p><p>  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) beat revenue and profit estimates, but says the  road ahead looks bumpy.  It's holding to 2016 sales projections of $50  billion, but lower oil prices have cut demand for Cats exploration  equipment.  Other sore spots include mining hardware, locomotives, and in  China, construction equipment.  </p><p>  DOUG OBERHLEMAN, CATERPILLAR CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  I'm going to be very  realistic with you.  We'll not repeat this quarter the rest of the year.  </p><p>  We've seen a real dichotomy here in the world.  A U.S. growing fairly  slowly but growing steadily and everywhere else, there is not much good  news.  </p><p>  HERERA:  In some locations it could get worse because Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) has yet to feel the full impact of oil's free fall, and now, the  Petrobras scandal in Brazil.  </p><p>  ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES:  Brazil has sort of been a basket  case.  One thing to remember is that they're sort of a manana economy.</p><p>  Our survey told us that North America will be better than expected.   And that is going to continue.  The next green shoot is going to come out  of Europe.  QE is going to make it happen.  </p><p>  HERERA:  Europe's economic stimulus is one reason the dollar has  strengthened though and 3M (NYSE:MMM) joins the chorus of companies blaming  a stronger dollar when it missed earning estimates.  3M (NYSE:MMM), which  makes post-its and coatings and ceramics, lowered its outlook for the rest  of year.</p><p>  Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) also said the dollar is hurting sales,  which dropped by more than 8 percent.  P&amp;G does about two-thirds of its  business outside of North America.  To cut cost, CFO Jon Moeller says it  can change its product mix, source materials locally and work on  efficiency.  </p><p>  JON MOELLER, PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CEO:  The good news these are things we  should do in the normal course of business and we just sharpen the focus  and keep it going.  It is part of everybody's job.  </p><p>  Obviously, markets like Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina are  very difficult right now.  We need to be selective where we are targeting  growth.</p><p>  HERERA:  P&amp;G's biggest markets, the U.S. and China, are a little  better off, and that's where they're hoping to find growth.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Now to another global brand which late today issued a big  earnings beat.  We're talking about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  They reported  a profit of 61 cents a share, 10 cents better than estimates and revenue  also topped expectations, coming in at almost $22 billion as sales of its  hardware and cloud computing products helped offset a decline in its  Windows business.  </p><p>  And investors liked what they saw, obviously, with shares rising  initially after that report.</p><p>  Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the one thing  shareholders should pay attention to.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's the revenue  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated in the commercial side of the business  where specifically the software it sells to companies, remember, that is  the real bread and butter for the software giant.  Wall Street expected  $12.4 billion, with many expecting a real miss.  So, that number was a  welcome relief from the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bulls.  </p><p>  And that commercial division isn't growing as strongly as in prior  quarters, thanks to certain headwinds, such as a rising dollar.  But  analysts say today's report was a step in the right direction for CEO Satya  Nadella.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  It was a different story for another big tech company, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).  The search giant reported earnings per share of $6.57,  expectations were for $6.60.  Revenue also missed, coming in at $17.3  billion, but up from a year ago, helped by a jump in the number of ads.   Investors initially brushed off that miss and sent shares higher.  </p><p>  Jon Fortt takes a look at the report's key takeaway.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The most  interesting thing out of Google's earnings report, YouTube.  It turns out  that property is performing better than a lot of people knew and the auto  play ads on YouTube, people are watching them.  That had been making  Google's results look actually worse than they are because it looked like  people were clicking on a bunch of ads that weren't paying out a lot of  money.  It turns out they were just enjoying watching the YouTube ads.   That and tight expense controls at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) sent the stock up  after hours.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  And a little later in the program, we'll look at one of  Google's big projects and how it's changing the game for some start-ups in  the Midwest.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Well, both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google's results  could, of course, impact how the NASDAQ trades tomorrow.  But after the  record close today, its first all-time high in 15 years.  By the end of the  trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 20 points to  18,058, and there's NASDAQ rising about 20 points.  That was enough to take  the index to where it hasn't been since March of 2,000.  We're at 5,056  now.  And the S&amp;P just about closed at an all-time high, we're five points  shy, up about five points today.  </p><p>  HERERA:  The nation's biggest automaker hilting a speed bump.  General  Motors' recall issues are mostly behind it and solid sales in parts of the  world, so expectations were pretty high.  But the automaker missed analyst  estimates for both earnings and revenue, and that weighed on the shares.   They were down more than 3 percent.  </p><p>  Phil LeBeau has more now on the road ahead for GM.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  General Motors (NYSE:GM), another quarter of solid profits that left  investors saying it's not good enough.  The automaker made over $2 billion  last quarter, but fell short of estimates.  Blame it on currency issues in  South America and higher than expected tax rate.  </p><p>  But the underlying business did well, with North America profits  surging thanks to truck and SUV sales, and GM says it's on track to hit all  of its financial targets this year.  But still GM shares have stalled.  On  the company's earnings call, CEO Mary Barra downplayed the possibility of  General Motors (NYSE:GM) merging with another automaker as some have  suggested.  </p><p>  MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO:  We have a well articulated plan.   We're in the middle of executing that, and we're not going to entertain  anything that distracts us from accomplishing that.  </p><p>  LEBEAU (on camera):  A big part of GM's game plan is returning more  cash to investors, which the company is doing through a higher dividend.   So far, that move has failed to have a big impact on GM shares.  </p><p>  Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And from cars to trains now.  Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the  largest U.S. rail, posted first quarter profits and sales below analyst  estimate.  The company cited congestion at West Coast ports and weak coal  demand and it sent shares lower by more than 2 percent as a result.  </p><p>  But while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rails come under  pressure, it's a different story for another transportation sector, trucks.  </p><p>  Morgan Brennan has more.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Trains versus trucks, are the tale of two emerging stories within  transports.  As the dollar strengthens and oil is stays weak, growth is  shifting from transportation of commodities which trains haul, to more  consumer related products to trucking's bread and butter.  Analysts this  dynamic is playing out in earnings.  </p><p>  DONALD BROUGHTON, AVONDALE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Rails are  struggling to put mid-single-digit earnings growth together.  On the other  hand, the truckers or consumer-oriented, less industrial oriented, and a  big beneficiary of cheap diesel fuel are posting phenomenal earnings  growth.  </p><p>  BRENNAN:  U.S. railroad earnings have been largely disappointing, due  to falling demand and rising service cost.  Take Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP),  which reported this morning.  Until now, the Western had rock solid  results, but the first quarter missed analyst estimates with volumes at 22  percent.  That after Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) reported  results that were even more disappointing than previously lowered guidance.  </p><p>  On the other hand, trucking demand is increasing as fuel costs fall.   Companies like Knight Transportation (NYSE:KNX), Werner Enterprises  (NASDAQ:WERN), J.B. Hunt and Marten Transport (NASDAQ:MRTN) have all beat  on earnings, posting big year over year growth.  </p><p>  BROUGHTON:  Of all of the companies that reported so far on the  trucking space, we've seen an average increase in earnings of 45 percent.   Of all the companies in the rail space that have already reported earnings,  we've seen 12 percent if you include the Canadian, 10 percent if you  include the Americans in earnings per rail.  So, you pick your poison.  </p><p>  BRENNAN (on camera):  For this Broughton and a number of others on  Wall Street are recommending investors consider buying stocks, and steer  clear of the rails.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  While much of the focus during earning season is on large  companies, it's small caps that are seeing big results.  According to  FactSet, small cap companies have seen their earnings grow nearly 3.5  percent so far this season, with revenues up 5 percent last year, while  large caps are seeing a drop of more than 3 percent.  The reason is likely  because of the strong dollar which small caps tend to be insolated from.  </p><p>  Joining us to talk about this is Stephen Wood, chief market strategist  with Russell Investments.  </p><p>  Good to see you again, Stephen.  Welcome.  </p><p>  STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Thank you.  </p><p>  HERERA:  Does it come down to something as simple as that, that small  cap companies tend to be domestically based and so, they don't have that  currency exposure?</p><p>  WOOD:  I think a large part is that.  By definition they can be  exposed to foreign markets but only U.S. markets.  So, currency for them  has really become a nonissue, at least in this current earnings season.   Whereas, for large caps, with national exposure, euro, that becomes much  more of an earnings consideration.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Where do you put small caps on the risk scale, Steve?  I  mean, are they riskier than if you want to invest in Europe?  Everybody is  investing in Europe right now because of this dollar currency exchange rate  situation.  Does that make the small caps riskier or not?  </p><p>  WOOD:  Well, as a general statement, historically, we've seen small  caps going to be volatile or riskier than many of the small large cap  names.  But I think the bigger issue in the U.S. one of valuation large or  small.  You know, markets are fully valued in the United States so  valuation is something of a head wind even though the economy is improving  and even though the Federal Reserve be very stimulative.  </p><p>  So, for our perspective, we do like Europe, we've upgraded Europe, and  we think there is more opportunities based predominantly upon valuations in  Europe. </p><p>  HERERA:  So, if we have pretty much full valuations, what does the  upcoming quarter bode for the small cap stocks?  </p><p>  WOOD:  I think small cap stock will probably continue in line with  what we've seen in the first quarter with a little bit of a pickup.  The  first quarter, again, very, very cold and the winter played in.  And we  have the dollar which you mentioned appreciate considerably, but also,  there was the oil story.</p><p>  So, I think the second quarter will not look dissimilar from the first  quarter, but by the backend of 2015, I think you're going to see a pick up  of earnings in small cap and in large cap space.  But I think the dollar is  not an issue for the small cap, but it will continue to be something of an  issue in large cap space.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Very quickly, if you were to invest in small cap, who are  the winners here?  Who would you go with?</p><p>  WOOD:  I think right now, we look at health care, which is insulated  from all these other factors.  We'd also look at financials, and I think  we'd also want to look at areas of the consumer which are going to benefit  from oil prices coming down, and with the dollar being a little bit more  powerful, they can add to their consumption.  </p><p>  HERERA:  Stephen, thanks so much.  </p><p>  WOOD:  Thank you.</p><p>  HERERA:  Stephen Wood with Russell Investments.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Coming up: California is drying up as the race to save the  state from this epic drought continues.  Some are looking to the Pacific  Ocean for help.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  HERERA:  There are reports this evening that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) plans to drop its $45 billion bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)  Cable and it could come as early as tomorrow.  The reports follow meetings  between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission, Justice  Department and executives from the cable companies.  Shares of Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), the parent company of CNBC which produces this  company, rose a fraction.  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell slightly.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And it was good for investors in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)  and Dunkin Brands.  After the bell, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported an  increase in sales at its coffee shops, calming concerns about cooling  growth there.  </p><p>  And it was a big earnings beat from Dunkin Brands.  That company also  raised its outlook for the whole year.  </p><p>  That CEO attributed the strong quarter to a few factors.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  NIGEL TRAVIS, DUNKIN BRANDS CEO:  We had great innovation.  We had new  products.  We had our products boost in loyalty, so we kicked it out to the  park in the market side of the business, but nothing works unless our  franchisees are open.  And despite all the snow, our franchisees got their  stores open.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares initially popped after the  close, while shares of Dunkin had their best day ever, up 8 percent today. </p><p>  We begin tonight's \"Market Focus\" now with quarterly results from tech  conglomerate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). </p><p>  That company reported a loss despite rising sales as they continue to  spend heavily on projects like drone delivery.  For the first time, it gave  financial details about its secretive cloud computing business which posted  revenue of about $1.5 billion.  Guidance from the online retailer, though,  was light for the futures.  Shares there were volatile after the close.   Stock ended the day up a fraction to $389.99.  </p><p>  And just one day after Coke reported strong results, Pepsi  disappointed the street.  The soda and snack giant says that it expects to  take a bigger hit from foreign exchange in 2015, and more than expected,  and that overshadowed the better than expected earnings and revenue results  overall.  Shares were, though, down 1.5 percent to $95.73.  </p><p>  Eli Lilly's profits beat by a margin.  They were boosted by a jump in  sales of its animal health products.  Lower spending on research and  marketing also help the drug maker's bottom line.  But revenue slipped as  the strong dollar hurt sales outside of the United States -- where have we  heard that before.  Shares were up a dime.  It closed at $72.40.  </p><p>  HERERA:  Dow Chemicals saw its earnings pop more than 40 percent as it  focused on its high margin business that caters to the packaging and  electronics industries.  The company CEO explains how Dow managed to  navigate around all of those headwinds.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  ANDREW LIVERIS, DOW CHEMICAL CEO:  We saw the same currency  volatility.  We saw the same oil price deflationary effects that are going  on in lots of markets around the world.  So, in terms of real-time growth - - you know, the bottom line matters, and we managed strong volume and good  margin management through productivity and launching new products.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HERERA:  Shares closed up almost 2 percent to $51 per share.  </p><p>  Lower fuel prices helped United Continental post a record quarterly  profit.  But the airline carrier saw its sales dip and it cut its capacity  forecast for 2015, as once again that strong dollar weaken demand from  abroad.  Shares slump almost 2 percent to $62.82.  </p><p>Pulte Group surprised the street, not in a good way, though.  The home  builder saw its profits drop more than 20 percent as home closings fell and  orders were soft.  Part of the problem was the Northeast because of  construction delays due to weather.  Shares tumbled almost 8 percent to  $19.97.  </p><p>  And Johnson and Johnson announced a dividend increase of about 7  percent to 75 cents a share.  The company CEO says that increase is due to  a strong financial position and confidence.  The yield on the payout is now  right about 3 percent.  The stock was up a fraction to $100.46.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Now to the drought out west.  California has for decades  neglected to build new water infrastructure, no new reservoirs, no new  dams.  But now, everything is on the water table, if you will, even  desalination, which removed salt from sea water.  </p><p>  Jane Wells reports from Carlsbad, California.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Bone  dry California sits next to the largest source of water in the world, the  Pacific Ocean.  Turning saltwater into fresh is expensive, requires a lot  of energy and isn't good for nearby fish, but California is running out of  choices.  </p><p>  JESSICA JONES, POSEIDON WATER COMMUNITY OUTREACH:  We are standing in  the middle of the reverse osmosis plant.  </p><p>  WELLS:  Jessica Jones is showing off the $1 billion desalination plant  being built by Poseidon, which will come on the line later this year and  provide 70 percent of the water to the San Diego County.  </p><p>  JONES:  We'll be producing 50 million gallons per day from this plant.   Behind me is a 72-inch sea water feed line.  </p><p>  WELLS:  Poseidon is financing the plant while San Diego has agreed to  buy the water at a fixed price for 30 years.  </p><p>  JONES:  Water from the desalination plant will be about the double the  cost of imported water.  </p><p>  WELLS:  That means water bills will go up an estimated 6 bucks a month  for customer, but the plants price will never change and it will never run  out of water.  The water coming through this pipe will be pushed through  fine filters to reduce the salt at 900 pounds per chance of pressure.  </p><p>  JONES:  If that pipe were to break, water would shoot one mile into  the air.</p><p>  WELLS:  It takes a tremendous amount of electricity to produce that  kind of pressure, but the plant hopes to recapture some of the energy  discharge in the process and use it as a sort of turbine to reduce costs.  </p><p>  JONES:  The Carlsbad project has been under development since 2000.   So, at that time, we were not in a drought in San Diego, or in California.   But that has changed and we're coming online at the perfect time.  </p><p>  WELLS (on camera):  Now, this process does kill fish, but Jones says  not as many as you may think, and it's often the case with new  developments, they are offsetting the damage they may do here by restoring  some wet lands further down the coast.  And while this may be the first  plant, it won't be the last.  A dozen such desalination projects are being  considered up and down the state.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Carlsbad, California.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  Back to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) now, which reported a big miss  on earnings this evening, the company has been working on the project  called Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, which provides super fast Internet to  small number of locations.  One of those locations is Kansas City.  </p><p>  And as Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reports, many start-ups have flocked to  the area because of it.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The  Internet connection may be blazing fast, but the rollout an entirely  different story.  </p><p>  As Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber gears up to expand its footprint around  the country, businesses have flocked to Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas  City, Missouri, to capitalize.  </p><p>  Google's high speed Fiber product has brought entrepreneurs to the  region from as far as Europe.  </p><p>  Jim Lysinger's cloud-based business Bime Analytics relocated to the  area from France in 2012.  Three years later, he's still waiting for Fiber  to deliver.  </p><p>  JIM LYSINGER, BIME ANALYTICS:  The business application hasn't come as  quickly as we had hoped.  But certainly, we're in the implementation  process and we expect to have it here in the next couple of weeks.  </p><p>  ROGERS:  But for those who have fiber, it has been a game-changer.  </p><p>  (on camera):  Buffering is something you're not going to see here in  Kansas City, where Internet connectivity speeds are up to 100 times faster  than what you see in homes across America, thanks to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Fiber.  </p><p>  (voice-over):  The hype around the high speed service is very real,  but some are still figuring how to leverage it.  It's brought innovation to  the region, with more than 100 start-ups launch in the past few years.  </p><p>  MATTHEW MARCUS, KC STARTUP VILLAGE CO-LEADER:  When Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) chose Kansas City to bring Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, it was  like it ignited passion and innovation just simply because they chose  Kansas City, and people rallied around it.  I mean, when Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to your town and brings a brand new service that's  nowhere else in the world, you're going to get excited about it.  </p><p>  ROGERS:  The energy reminds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of another game- changer from the past.  </p><p>  RACHEL MERLO, GOOGLE FIBER COMMUNITY IMPACT MANAGER:  What we're  seeing so far is looking a little bit like the early days of going from  dialup to broadband.  We didn't really know what to expect, but the  innovation followed.  </p><p>  ROGERS:  And while there's no set time line for Google's rollout into  five new cities, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh Durham,  and Salt Lake City, both customers and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) agree, speed is  what matters.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, in Kansas City, Kansas, I'm Kate Rogers  (NYSE:ROG).  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  Coming up, with medical marijuana now legal in 23 states, one  entrepreneur is hoping that she has found the next niche market.  The final  part of our \"Marijuana and Money\" series is next.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  HERERA:  Here is what to watch for tomorrow on the data front, we'll  have durable goods orders, an indicator of demand for big ticket  manufactured items, earnings from Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), American  Airlines, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are due out, and consumers will finally get  their hands on those Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches.  </p><p>  That's what's on the agenda for Friday, Bill.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Whoo-hoo.  Big day.  </p><p>  Meanwhile, Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras put a price  finally on that massive corruption scandal that we told you about last  night.  The company which trades on the New York Stock Exchange will write  off $17 billion due to losses from graft and overinflated assets.  The  disclosure came in Petrobras as first financial statement in more than  eight months.  </p><p>  In an interview today with our Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, the company's  chief financial officer said those charges could get even bigger as the  criminal investigation into the case expands.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  IVAN MONTEIRO, PETROBRAS CEO:  That's the best information that we  have at this moment.  But it's impossible to say that you -- that this  number will cover everything because information that we don't have access  or that -- or is available, all in the future, it's impossible to know  about that.  </p><p>  MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   So,  it's possible there could be more down the road?  </p><p>  MONTEIRO:  Or -- or more or less.  We really don't know.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Well, some apparently had estimated the cost of the  corruption would be greater it.  It actually helped shares of Petrobras  rising more than 5 percent today.  </p><p>  HERERA:  And finally tonight, we all know that people spend a lot on  their pets, to the tune of $58 billion last year.  And with the legalized  pot industry growing, some entrepreneurs have found a new niche market, pot  for pets.  </p><p>  Dina Gusovsky has more in the final part of our series, \"Marijuana and  Money.\" </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sprout, do you want a treat?  Do you want a  treatable?</p><p>  DINA GUSOVSKY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   This is Sprout.  She only has three legs and that's one of the reasons her  mom is feeding her marijuana.  </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are giving her treatables to help prevent  arthritis down the road.  A treatable is a dog treat or pet treat that is  baked with CBD compound, which is the non-psychoactive substance of the  cannabis plant.  </p><p>  GUSOVSKY:  Dory suffers from separation anxiety. She gets these CBD  treats daily.  </p><p>  As for the critics?  </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think they would be crazy to give their dogs  really strong pharmaceutical drugs that make them feel dopey and out of  touch rather than happy and calm.  </p><p>  GUSOVSKY:  Brother and sister Morgan and Emily Paxhia are investors  Auntie Dolores, the maker of treatables.  </p><p>  JULIANNA CARELLA, AUNTIE DOLORES:  They are actually delicious.  They  taste like Graham crackers.  We're not interested in getting our dogs high,  but interested in providing a wellness regimen that is safe and nontoxic.  </p><p>  The idea is if adults can enjoy cannabis, animals should too, but we  stick to the ones that are appropriate for them.  </p><p>  GUSOVSKY:  And the kitchen has plenty of edibles for humans as well.  </p><p>  CARELLA:  Last year, we sold about a quarter of a million units  altogether.  Our strawberry pretzels and this is our most popular products.   I think we sold about 50,000 of these last year.  </p><p>  GUSOVSKY:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dina Gusovsky in San  Francisco. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  And last night, we told about a story offering a rare glimpse  into the life of a marijuana farmer.  That piece is on our Web site,  NBR.com.  </p><p>  And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And I'm Bill Griffeth.  We'll see you tomorrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The NASDAQ finally closes at a record, topping its dot-com era  high.  And tech earnings tonight, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could set the tone for tomorrow.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Message to the market.   What Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG),  three of the world's biggest global companies, are saying about the health  of the world economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  And why this earnings season is turning out to be a big one  for small caps.</p><p>All of that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, April the 23rd.  </p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Bill Griffeth, in tonight  for Tyler Mathisen.  </p><p>HERERA:  And I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>The NASDAQ closed at an all-time high.  We'll have more on that  momentarily.  </p><p>But we begin tonight with three of the world's biggest companies and  what they are saying about the global economy.  </p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the maker of construction and mining  equipment, which reaches more than 180 countries, blew past earnings  estimates.  But it also issued a warning.  </p><p>Procter and Gamble, the world's largest household product firms which  touched consumers across the global said revenues fell from last year, a  sign of weakening demand and perhaps something else.  </p><p>And 3M (NYSE:MMM), a manufacturing conglomerate, cut its full year  outlook.  </p><p>Together these three companies are sending a message to the markets  about the global economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA (voice-over):  Giant multinationals, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M  (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), all Dow components, are feeling  the effects of a stronger dollar, the freefall in oil prices, and  geopolitical uncertainties.  </p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) beat revenue and profit estimates, but says the  road ahead looks bumpy.  It's holding to 2016 sales projections of $50  billion, but lower oil prices have cut demand for Cats exploration  equipment.  Other sore spots include mining hardware, locomotives, and in  China, construction equipment.  </p><p>DOUG OBERHLEMAN, CATERPILLAR CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  I'm going to be very  realistic with you.  We'll not repeat this quarter the rest of the year.  </p><p>We've seen a real dichotomy here in the world.  A U.S. growing fairly  slowly but growing steadily and everywhere else, there is not much good  news.  </p><p>HERERA:  In some locations it could get worse because Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) has yet to feel the full impact of oil's free fall, and now, the  Petrobras scandal in Brazil.  </p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES:  Brazil has sort of been a basket  case.  One thing to remember is that they're sort of a manana economy.</p><p>Our survey told us that North America will be better than expected.   And that is going to continue.  The next green shoot is going to come out  of Europe.  QE is going to make it happen.  </p><p>HERERA:  Europe's economic stimulus is one reason the dollar has  strengthened though and 3M (NYSE:MMM) joins the chorus of companies blaming  a stronger dollar when it missed earning estimates.  3M (NYSE:MMM), which  makes post-its and coatings and ceramics, lowered its outlook for the rest  of year.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) also said the dollar is hurting sales,  which dropped by more than 8 percent.  P&amp;G does about two-thirds of its  business outside of North America.  To cut cost, CFO Jon Moeller says it  can change its product mix, source materials locally and work on  efficiency.  </p><p>JON MOELLER, PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CEO:  The good news these are things we  should do in the normal course of business and we just sharpen the focus  and keep it going.  It is part of everybody's job.  </p><p>Obviously, markets like Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina are  very difficult right now.  We need to be selective where we are targeting  growth.</p><p>HERERA:  P&amp;G's biggest markets, the U.S. and China, are a little  better off, and that's where they're hoping to find growth.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now to another global brand which late today issued a big  earnings beat.  We're talking about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  They reported  a profit of 61 cents a share, 10 cents better than estimates and revenue  also topped expectations, coming in at almost $22 billion as sales of its  hardware and cloud computing products helped offset a decline in its  Windows business.  </p><p>And investors liked what they saw, obviously, with shares rising  initially after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the one thing  shareholders should pay attention to.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's the revenue  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated in the commercial side of the business  where specifically the software it sells to companies, remember, that is  the real bread and butter for the software giant.  Wall Street expected  $12.4 billion, with many expecting a real miss.  So, that number was a  welcome relief from the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bulls.  </p><p>And that commercial division isn't growing as strongly as in prior  quarters, thanks to certain headwinds, such as a rising dollar.  But  analysts say today's report was a step in the right direction for CEO Satya  Nadella.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It was a different story for another big tech company, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).  The search giant reported earnings per share of $6.57,  expectations were for $6.60.  Revenue also missed, coming in at $17.3  billion, but up from a year ago, helped by a jump in the number of ads.   Investors initially brushed off that miss and sent shares higher.  </p><p>Jon Fortt takes a look at the report's key takeaway.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The most  interesting thing out of Google's earnings report, YouTube.  It turns out  that property is performing better than a lot of people knew and the auto  play ads on YouTube, people are watching them.  That had been making  Google's results look actually worse than they are because it looked like  people were clicking on a bunch of ads that weren't paying out a lot of  money.  It turns out they were just enjoying watching the YouTube ads.   That and tight expense controls at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) sent the stock up  after hours.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And a little later in the program, we'll look at one of  Google's big projects and how it's changing the game for some start-ups in  the Midwest.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google's results  could, of course, impact how the NASDAQ trades tomorrow.  But after the  record close today, its first all-time high in 15 years.  By the end of the  trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 20 points to  18,058, and there's NASDAQ rising about 20 points.  That was enough to take  the index to where it hasn't been since March of 2,000.  We're at 5,056  now.  And the S&amp;P just about closed at an all-time high, we're five points  shy, up about five points today.  </p><p>HERERA:  The nation's biggest automaker hilting a speed bump.  General  Motors' recall issues are mostly behind it and solid sales in parts of the  world, so expectations were pretty high.  But the automaker missed analyst  estimates for both earnings and revenue, and that weighed on the shares.   They were down more than 3 percent.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau has more now on the road ahead for GM.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  General Motors (NYSE:GM), another quarter of solid profits that left  investors saying it's not good enough.  The automaker made over $2 billion  last quarter, but fell short of estimates.  Blame it on currency issues in  South America and higher than expected tax rate.  </p><p>But the underlying business did well, with North America profits  surging thanks to truck and SUV sales, and GM says it's on track to hit all  of its financial targets this year.  But still GM shares have stalled.  On  the company's earnings call, CEO Mary Barra downplayed the possibility of  General Motors (NYSE:GM) merging with another automaker as some have  suggested.  </p><p>MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO:  We have a well articulated plan.   We're in the middle of executing that, and we're not going to entertain  anything that distracts us from accomplishing that.  </p><p>LEBEAU (on camera):  A big part of GM's game plan is returning more  cash to investors, which the company is doing through a higher dividend.   So far, that move has failed to have a big impact on GM shares.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And from cars to trains now.  Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the  largest U.S. rail, posted first quarter profits and sales below analyst  estimate.  The company cited congestion at West Coast ports and weak coal  demand and it sent shares lower by more than 2 percent as a result.  </p><p>But while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rails come under  pressure, it's a different story for another transportation sector, trucks.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Trains versus trucks, are the tale of two emerging stories within  transports.  As the dollar strengthens and oil is stays weak, growth is  shifting from transportation of commodities which trains haul, to more  consumer related products to trucking's bread and butter.  Analysts this  dynamic is playing out in earnings.  </p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, AVONDALE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Rails are  struggling to put mid-single-digit earnings growth together.  On the other  hand, the truckers or consumer-oriented, less industrial oriented, and a  big beneficiary of cheap diesel fuel are posting phenomenal earnings  growth.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  U.S. railroad earnings have been largely disappointing, due  to falling demand and rising service cost.  Take Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP),  which reported this morning.  Until now, the Western had rock solid  results, but the first quarter missed analyst estimates with volumes at 22  percent.  That after Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) reported  results that were even more disappointing than previously lowered guidance.  </p><p>On the other hand, trucking demand is increasing as fuel costs fall.   Companies like Knight Transportation (NYSE:KNX), Werner Enterprises  (NASDAQ:WERN), J.B. Hunt and Marten Transport (NASDAQ:MRTN) have all beat  on earnings, posting big year over year growth.  </p><p>BROUGHTON:  Of all of the companies that reported so far on the  trucking space, we've seen an average increase in earnings of 45 percent.   Of all the companies in the rail space that have already reported earnings,  we've seen 12 percent if you include the Canadian, 10 percent if you  include the Americans in earnings per rail.  So, you pick your poison.  </p><p>BRENNAN (on camera):  For this Broughton and a number of others on  Wall Street are recommending investors consider buying stocks, and steer  clear of the rails.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  While much of the focus during earning season is on large  companies, it's small caps that are seeing big results.  According to  FactSet, small cap companies have seen their earnings grow nearly 3.5  percent so far this season, with revenues up 5 percent last year, while  large caps are seeing a drop of more than 3 percent.  The reason is likely  because of the strong dollar which small caps tend to be insolated from.  </p><p>Joining us to talk about this is Stephen Wood, chief market strategist  with Russell Investments.  </p><p>Good to see you again, Stephen.  Welcome.  </p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Does it come down to something as simple as that, that small  cap companies tend to be domestically based and so, they don't have that  currency exposure?</p><p>WOOD:  I think a large part is that.  By definition they can be  exposed to foreign markets but only U.S. markets.  So, currency for them  has really become a nonissue, at least in this current earnings season.   Whereas, for large caps, with national exposure, euro, that becomes much  more of an earnings consideration.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Where do you put small caps on the risk scale, Steve?  I  mean, are they riskier than if you want to invest in Europe?  Everybody is  investing in Europe right now because of this dollar currency exchange rate  situation.  Does that make the small caps riskier or not?  </p><p>WOOD:  Well, as a general statement, historically, we've seen small  caps going to be volatile or riskier than many of the small large cap  names.  But I think the bigger issue in the U.S. one of valuation large or  small.  You know, markets are fully valued in the United States so  valuation is something of a head wind even though the economy is improving  and even though the Federal Reserve be very stimulative.  </p><p>So, for our perspective, we do like Europe, we've upgraded Europe, and  we think there is more opportunities based predominantly upon valuations in  Europe. </p><p>HERERA:  So, if we have pretty much full valuations, what does the  upcoming quarter bode for the small cap stocks?  </p><p>WOOD:  I think small cap stock will probably continue in line with  what we've seen in the first quarter with a little bit of a pickup.  The  first quarter, again, very, very cold and the winter played in.  And we  have the dollar which you mentioned appreciate considerably, but also,  there was the oil story.</p><p>So, I think the second quarter will not look dissimilar from the first  quarter, but by the backend of 2015, I think you're going to see a pick up  of earnings in small cap and in large cap space.  But I think the dollar is  not an issue for the small cap, but it will continue to be something of an  issue in large cap space.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very quickly, if you were to invest in small cap, who are  the winners here?  Who would you go with?</p><p>WOOD:  I think right now, we look at health care, which is insulated  from all these other factors.  We'd also look at financials, and I think  we'd also want to look at areas of the consumer which are going to benefit  from oil prices coming down, and with the dollar being a little bit more  powerful, they can add to their consumption.  </p><p>HERERA:  Stephen, thanks so much.  </p><p>WOOD:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Stephen Wood with Russell Investments.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up: California is drying up as the race to save the  state from this epic drought continues.  Some are looking to the Pacific  Ocean for help.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  There are reports this evening that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) plans to drop its $45 billion bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)  Cable and it could come as early as tomorrow.  The reports follow meetings  between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission, Justice  Department and executives from the cable companies.  Shares of Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), the parent company of CNBC which produces this  company, rose a fraction.  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell slightly.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And it was good for investors in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)  and Dunkin Brands.  After the bell, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported an  increase in sales at its coffee shops, calming concerns about cooling  growth there.  </p><p>And it was a big earnings beat from Dunkin Brands.  That company also  raised its outlook for the whole year.  </p><p>That CEO attributed the strong quarter to a few factors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIGEL TRAVIS, DUNKIN BRANDS CEO:  We had great innovation.  We had new  products.  We had our products boost in loyalty, so we kicked it out to the  park in the market side of the business, but nothing works unless our  franchisees are open.  And despite all the snow, our franchisees got their  stores open.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares initially popped after the  close, while shares of Dunkin had their best day ever, up 8 percent today. </p><p>We begin tonight's \"Market Focus\" now with quarterly results from tech  conglomerate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). </p><p>That company reported a loss despite rising sales as they continue to  spend heavily on projects like drone delivery.  For the first time, it gave  financial details about its secretive cloud computing business which posted  revenue of about $1.5 billion.  Guidance from the online retailer, though,  was light for the futures.  Shares there were volatile after the close.   Stock ended the day up a fraction to $389.99.  </p><p>And just one day after Coke reported strong results, Pepsi  disappointed the street.  The soda and snack giant says that it expects to  take a bigger hit from foreign exchange in 2015, and more than expected,  and that overshadowed the better than expected earnings and revenue results  overall.  Shares were, though, down 1.5 percent to $95.73.  </p><p>Eli Lilly's profits beat by a margin.  They were boosted by a jump in  sales of its animal health products.  Lower spending on research and  marketing also help the drug maker's bottom line.  But revenue slipped as  the strong dollar hurt sales outside of the United States -- where have we  heard that before.  Shares were up a dime.  It closed at $72.40.  </p><p>HERERA:  Dow Chemicals saw its earnings pop more than 40 percent as it  focused on its high margin business that caters to the packaging and  electronics industries.  The company CEO explains how Dow managed to  navigate around all of those headwinds.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, DOW CHEMICAL CEO:  We saw the same currency  volatility.  We saw the same oil price deflationary effects that are going  on in lots of markets around the world.  So, in terms of real-time growth - - you know, the bottom line matters, and we managed strong volume and good  margin management through productivity and launching new products.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares closed up almost 2 percent to $51 per share.  </p><p>Lower fuel prices helped United Continental post a record quarterly  profit.  But the airline carrier saw its sales dip and it cut its capacity  forecast for 2015, as once again that strong dollar weaken demand from  abroad.  Shares slump almost 2 percent to $62.82.  </p><p>Pulte Group surprised the street, not in a good way, though.  The home  builder saw its profits drop more than 20 percent as home closings fell and  orders were soft.  Part of the problem was the Northeast because of  construction delays due to weather.  Shares tumbled almost 8 percent to  $19.97.  </p><p>And Johnson and Johnson announced a dividend increase of about 7  percent to 75 cents a share.  The company CEO says that increase is due to  a strong financial position and confidence.  The yield on the payout is now  right about 3 percent.  The stock was up a fraction to $100.46.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now to the drought out west.  California has for decades  neglected to build new water infrastructure, no new reservoirs, no new  dams.  But now, everything is on the water table, if you will, even  desalination, which removed salt from sea water.  </p><p>Jane Wells reports from Carlsbad, California.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Bone  dry California sits next to the largest source of water in the world, the  Pacific Ocean.  Turning saltwater into fresh is expensive, requires a lot  of energy and isn't good for nearby fish, but California is running out of  choices.  </p><p>JESSICA JONES, POSEIDON WATER COMMUNITY OUTREACH:  We are standing in  the middle of the reverse osmosis plant.  </p><p>WELLS:  Jessica Jones is showing off the $1 billion desalination plant  being built by Poseidon, which will come on the line later this year and  provide 70 percent of the water to the San Diego County.  </p><p>JONES:  We'll be producing 50 million gallons per day from this plant.   Behind me is a 72-inch sea water feed line.  </p><p>WELLS:  Poseidon is financing the plant while San Diego has agreed to  buy the water at a fixed price for 30 years.  </p><p>JONES:  Water from the desalination plant will be about the double the  cost of imported water.  </p><p>WELLS:  That means water bills will go up an estimated 6 bucks a month  for customer, but the plants price will never change and it will never run  out of water.  The water coming through this pipe will be pushed through  fine filters to reduce the salt at 900 pounds per chance of pressure.  </p><p>JONES:  If that pipe were to break, water would shoot one mile into  the air.</p><p>WELLS:  It takes a tremendous amount of electricity to produce that  kind of pressure, but the plant hopes to recapture some of the energy  discharge in the process and use it as a sort of turbine to reduce costs.  </p><p>JONES:  The Carlsbad project has been under development since 2000.   So, at that time, we were not in a drought in San Diego, or in California.   But that has changed and we're coming online at the perfect time.  </p><p>WELLS (on camera):  Now, this process does kill fish, but Jones says  not as many as you may think, and it's often the case with new  developments, they are offsetting the damage they may do here by restoring  some wet lands further down the coast.  And while this may be the first  plant, it won't be the last.  A dozen such desalination projects are being  considered up and down the state.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Carlsbad, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Back to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) now, which reported a big miss  on earnings this evening, the company has been working on the project  called Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, which provides super fast Internet to  small number of locations.  One of those locations is Kansas City.  </p><p>And as Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reports, many start-ups have flocked to  the area because of it.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The  Internet connection may be blazing fast, but the rollout an entirely  different story.  </p><p>As Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber gears up to expand its footprint around  the country, businesses have flocked to Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas  City, Missouri, to capitalize.  </p><p>Google's high speed Fiber product has brought entrepreneurs to the  region from as far as Europe.  </p><p>Jim Lysinger's cloud-based business Bime Analytics relocated to the  area from France in 2012.  Three years later, he's still waiting for Fiber  to deliver.  </p><p>JIM LYSINGER, BIME ANALYTICS:  The business application hasn't come as  quickly as we had hoped.  But certainly, we're in the implementation  process and we expect to have it here in the next couple of weeks.  </p><p>ROGERS:  But for those who have fiber, it has been a game-changer.  </p><p>(on camera):  Buffering is something you're not going to see here in  Kansas City, where Internet connectivity speeds are up to 100 times faster  than what you see in homes across America, thanks to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Fiber.  </p><p>(voice-over):  The hype around the high speed service is very real,  but some are still figuring how to leverage it.  It's brought innovation to  the region, with more than 100 start-ups launch in the past few years.  </p><p>MATTHEW MARCUS, KC STARTUP VILLAGE CO-LEADER:  When Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) chose Kansas City to bring Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, it was  like it ignited passion and innovation just simply because they chose  Kansas City, and people rallied around it.  I mean, when Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to your town and brings a brand new service that's  nowhere else in the world, you're going to get excited about it.  </p><p>ROGERS:  The energy reminds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of another game- changer from the past.  </p><p>RACHEL MERLO, GOOGLE FIBER COMMUNITY IMPACT MANAGER:  What we're  seeing so far is looking a little bit like the early days of going from  dialup to broadband.  We didn't really know what to expect, but the  innovation followed.  </p><p>ROGERS:  And while there's no set time line for Google's rollout into  five new cities, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh Durham,  and Salt Lake City, both customers and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) agree, speed is  what matters.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, in Kansas City, Kansas, I'm Kate Rogers  (NYSE:ROG).  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, with medical marijuana now legal in 23 states, one  entrepreneur is hoping that she has found the next niche market.  The final  part of our \"Marijuana and Money\" series is next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Here is what to watch for tomorrow on the data front, we'll  have durable goods orders, an indicator of demand for big ticket  manufactured items, earnings from Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), American  Airlines, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are due out, and consumers will finally get  their hands on those Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches.  </p><p>That's what's on the agenda for Friday, Bill.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Whoo-hoo.  Big day.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras put a price  finally on that massive corruption scandal that we told you about last  night.  The company which trades on the New York Stock Exchange will write  off $17 billion due to losses from graft and overinflated assets.  The  disclosure came in Petrobras as first financial statement in more than  eight months.  </p><p>In an interview today with our Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, the company's  chief financial officer said those charges could get even bigger as the  criminal investigation into the case expands.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVAN MONTEIRO, PETROBRAS CEO:  That's the best information that we  have at this moment.  But it's impossible to say that you -- that this  number will cover everything because information that we don't have access  or that -- or is available, all in the future, it's impossible to know  about that.  </p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   So,  it's possible there could be more down the road?  </p><p>MONTEIRO:  Or -- or more or less.  We really don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, some apparently had estimated the cost of the  corruption would be greater it.  It actually helped shares of Petrobras  rising more than 5 percent today.  </p><p>HERERA:  And finally tonight, we all know that people spend a lot on  their pets, to the tune of $58 billion last year.  And with the legalized  pot industry growing, some entrepreneurs have found a new niche market, pot  for pets.  </p><p>Dina Gusovsky has more in the final part of our series, \"Marijuana and  Money.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sprout, do you want a treat?  Do you want a  treatable?</p><p>DINA GUSOVSKY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   This is Sprout.  She only has three legs and that's one of the reasons her  mom is feeding her marijuana.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are giving her treatables to help prevent  arthritis down the road.  A treatable is a dog treat or pet treat that is  baked with CBD compound, which is the non-psychoactive substance of the  cannabis plant.  </p><p>GUSOVSKY:  Dory suffers from separation anxiety. She gets these CBD  treats daily.  </p><p>As for the critics?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think they would be crazy to give their dogs  really strong pharmaceutical drugs that make them feel dopey and out of  touch rather than happy and calm.  </p><p>GUSOVSKY:  Brother and sister Morgan and Emily Paxhia are investors  Auntie Dolores, the maker of treatables.  </p><p>JULIANNA CARELLA, AUNTIE DOLORES:  They are actually delicious.  They  taste like Graham crackers.  We're not interested in getting our dogs high,  but interested in providing a wellness regimen that is safe and nontoxic.  </p><p>The idea is if adults can enjoy cannabis, animals should too, but we  stick to the ones that are appropriate for them.  </p><p>GUSOVSKY:  And the kitchen has plenty of edibles for humans as well.  </p><p>CARELLA:  Last year, we sold about a quarter of a million units  altogether.  Our strawberry pretzels and this is our most popular products.   I think we sold about 50,000 of these last year.  </p><p>GUSOVSKY:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dina Gusovsky in San  Francisco. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And last night, we told about a story offering a rare glimpse  into the life of a marijuana farmer.  That piece is on our Web site,  NBR.com.  </p><p>And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And I'm Bill Griffeth.  We'll see you tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The NASDAQ finally closes at a record, topping its dot-com era high. And tech earnings tonight, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could set the tone for tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Message to the market. What Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), three of the world`s biggest global companies, are saying about the health of the world economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: And why this earnings season is turning out to be a big one for small caps.</p><p>All of that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, April the 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. I`m Bill Griffeth, in tonight for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>HERERA: And I`m Sue Herera.</p><p>The NASDAQ closed at an all-time high. We`ll have more on that momentarily.</p><p>But we begin tonight with three of the world`s biggest companies and what they are saying about the global economy.</p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the maker of construction and mining equipment, which reaches more than 180 countries, blew past earnings estimates. But it also issued a warning.</p><p>Procter and Gamble, the world`s largest household product firms which touched consumers across the global said revenues fell from last year, a sign of weakening demand and perhaps something else.</p><p>And 3M (NYSE:MMM), a manufacturing conglomerate, cut its full year outlook.</p><p>Together these three companies are sending a message to the markets about the global economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA (voice-over): Giant multinationals, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), all Dow components, are feeling the effects of a stronger dollar, the freefall in oil prices, and geopolitical uncertainties.</p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) beat revenue and profit estimates, but says the road ahead looks bumpy. It`s holding to 2016 sales projections of $50 billion, but lower oil prices have cut demand for Cats exploration equipment. Other sore spots include mining hardware, locomotives, and in China, construction equipment.</p><p>DOUG OBERHLEMAN, CATERPILLAR CHAIRMAN AND CEO: I`m going to be very realistic with you. We`ll not repeat this quarter the rest of the year.</p><p>We`ve seen a real dichotomy here in the world. A U.S. growing fairly slowly but growing steadily and everywhere else, there is not much good news.</p><p>HERERA: In some locations it could get worse because Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has yet to feel the full impact of oil`s free fall, and now, the Petrobras scandal in Brazil.</p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES: Brazil has sort of been a basket case. One thing to remember is that they`re sort of a manana economy.</p><p>Our survey told us that North America will be better than expected. And that is going to continue. The next green shoot is going to come out of Europe. QE is going to make it happen.</p><p>HERERA: Europe`s economic stimulus is one reason the dollar has strengthened though and 3M (NYSE:MMM) joins the chorus of companies blaming a stronger dollar when it missed earning estimates. 3M (NYSE:MMM), which makes post-its and coatings and ceramics, lowered its outlook for the rest of year.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) also said the dollar is hurting sales, which dropped by more than 8 percent. P&amp;G does about two-thirds of its business outside of North America. To cut cost, CFO Jon Moeller says it can change its product mix, source materials locally and work on efficiency.</p><p>JON MOELLER, PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CEO: The good news these are things we should do in the normal course of business and we just sharpen the focus and keep it going. It is part of everybody`s job.</p><p>Obviously, markets like Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina are very difficult right now. We need to be selective where we are targeting growth.</p><p>HERERA: P&amp;G`s biggest markets, the U.S. and China, are a little better off, and that`s where they`re hoping to find growth.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to another global brand which late today issued a big earnings beat. We`re talking about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They reported a profit of 61 cents a share, 10 cents better than estimates and revenue also topped expectations, coming in at almost $22 billion as sales of its hardware and cloud computing products helped offset a decline in its Windows business.</p><p>And investors liked what they saw, obviously, with shares rising initially after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the one thing shareholders should pay attention to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s the revenue Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated in the commercial side of the business where specifically the software it sells to companies, remember, that is the real bread and butter for the software giant. Wall Street expected $12.4 billion, with many expecting a real miss. So, that number was a welcome relief from the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bulls.</p><p>And that commercial division isn`t growing as strongly as in prior quarters, thanks to certain headwinds, such as a rising dollar. But analysts say today`s report was a step in the right direction for CEO Satya Nadella.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It was a different story for another big tech company, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The search giant reported earnings per share of $6.57, expectations were for $6.60. Revenue also missed, coming in at $17.3 billion, but up from a year ago, helped by a jump in the number of ads. Investors initially brushed off that miss and sent shares higher.</p><p>Jon Fortt takes a look at the report`s key takeaway.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The most interesting thing out of Google`s earnings report, YouTube. It turns out that property is performing better than a lot of people knew and the auto play ads on YouTube, people are watching them. That had been making Google`s results look actually worse than they are because it looked like people were clicking on a bunch of ads that weren`t paying out a lot of money. It turns out they were just enjoying watching the YouTube ads. That and tight expense controls at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) sent the stock up after hours.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And a little later in the program, we`ll look at one of Google`s big projects and how it`s changing the game for some start-ups in the Midwest.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google`s results could, of course, impact how the NASDAQ trades tomorrow. But after the record close today, its first all-time high in 15 years. By the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 20 points to 18,058, and there`s NASDAQ rising about 20 points. That was enough to take the index to where it hasn`t been since March of 2,000. We`re at 5,056 now. And the S&amp;P just about closed at an all-time high, we`re five points shy, up about five points today.</p><p>HERERA: The nation`s biggest automaker hilting a speed bump. General Motors` recall issues are mostly behind it and solid sales in parts of the world, so expectations were pretty high. But the automaker missed analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, and that weighed on the shares. They were down more than 3 percent.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more now on the road ahead for GM.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For General Motors (NYSE:GM), another quarter of solid profits that left investors saying it`s not good enough. The automaker made over $2 billion last quarter, but fell short of estimates. Blame it on currency issues in South America and higher than expected tax rate.</p><p>But the underlying business did well, with North America profits surging thanks to truck and SUV sales, and GM says it`s on track to hit all of its financial targets this year. But still GM shares have stalled. On the company`s earnings call, CEO Mary Barra downplayed the possibility of General Motors (NYSE:GM) merging with another automaker as some have suggested.</p><p>MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO: We have a well articulated plan. We`re in the middle of executing that, and we`re not going to entertain anything that distracts us from accomplishing that.</p><p>LEBEAU (on camera): A big part of GM`s game plan is returning more cash to investors, which the company is doing through a higher dividend. So far, that move has failed to have a big impact on GM shares.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And from cars to trains now. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the largest U.S. rail, posted first quarter profits and sales below analyst estimate. The company cited congestion at West Coast ports and weak coal demand and it sent shares lower by more than 2 percent as a result.</p><p>But while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rails come under pressure, it`s a different story for another transportation sector, trucks.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Trains versus trucks, are the tale of two emerging stories within transports. As the dollar strengthens and oil is stays weak, growth is shifting from transportation of commodities which trains haul, to more consumer related products to trucking`s bread and butter. Analysts this dynamic is playing out in earnings.</p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, AVONDALE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: Rails are struggling to put mid-single-digit earnings growth together. On the other hand, the truckers or consumer-oriented, less industrial oriented, and a big beneficiary of cheap diesel fuel are posting phenomenal earnings growth.</p><p>BRENNAN: U.S. railroad earnings have been largely disappointing, due to falling demand and rising service cost. Take Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), which reported this morning. Until now, the Western had rock solid results, but the first quarter missed analyst estimates with volumes at 22 percent. That after Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) reported results that were even more disappointing than previously lowered guidance.</p><p>On the other hand, trucking demand is increasing as fuel costs fall. Companies like Knight Transportation (NYSE:KNX), Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ:WERN), J.B. Hunt and Marten Transport (NASDAQ:MRTN) have all beat on earnings, posting big year over year growth.</p><p>BROUGHTON: Of all of the companies that reported so far on the trucking space, we`ve seen an average increase in earnings of 45 percent. Of all the companies in the rail space that have already reported earnings, we`ve seen 12 percent if you include the Canadian, 10 percent if you include the Americans in earnings per rail. So, you pick your poison.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): For this Broughton and a number of others on Wall Street are recommending investors consider buying stocks, and steer clear of the rails.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: While much of the focus during earning season is on large companies, it`s small caps that are seeing big results. According to FactSet, small cap companies have seen their earnings grow nearly 3.5 percent so far this season, with revenues up 5 percent last year, while large caps are seeing a drop of more than 3 percent. The reason is likely because of the strong dollar which small caps tend to be insolated from.</p><p>Joining us to talk about this is Stephen Wood, chief market strategist with Russell Investments.</p><p>Good to see you again, Stephen. Welcome.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Does it come down to something as simple as that, that small cap companies tend to be domestically based and so, they don`t have that currency exposure?</p><p>WOOD: I think a large part is that. By definition they can be exposed to foreign markets but only U.S. markets. So, currency for them has really become a nonissue, at least in this current earnings season. Whereas, for large caps, with national exposure, euro, that becomes much more of an earnings consideration.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Where do you put small caps on the risk scale, Steve? I mean, are they riskier than if you want to invest in Europe? Everybody is investing in Europe right now because of this dollar currency exchange rate situation. Does that make the small caps riskier or not?</p><p>WOOD: Well, as a general statement, historically, we`ve seen small caps going to be volatile or riskier than many of the small large cap names. But I think the bigger issue in the U.S. one of valuation large or small. You know, markets are fully valued in the United States so valuation is something of a head wind even though the economy is improving and even though the Federal Reserve be very stimulative.</p><p>So, for our perspective, we do like Europe, we`ve upgraded Europe, and we think there is more opportunities based predominantly upon valuations in Europe.</p><p>HERERA: So, if we have pretty much full valuations, what does the upcoming quarter bode for the small cap stocks?</p><p>WOOD: I think small cap stock will probably continue in line with what we`ve seen in the first quarter with a little bit of a pickup. The first quarter, again, very, very cold and the winter played in. And we have the dollar which you mentioned appreciate considerably, but also, there was the oil story.</p><p>So, I think the second quarter will not look dissimilar from the first quarter, but by the backend of 2015, I think you`re going to see a pick up of earnings in small cap and in large cap space. But I think the dollar is not an issue for the small cap, but it will continue to be something of an issue in large cap space.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly, if you were to invest in small cap, who are the winners here? Who would you go with?</p><p>WOOD: I think right now, we look at health care, which is insulated from all these other factors. We`d also look at financials, and I think we`d also want to look at areas of the consumer which are going to benefit from oil prices coming down, and with the dollar being a little bit more powerful, they can add to their consumption.</p><p>HERERA: Stephen, thanks so much.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Stephen Wood with Russell Investments.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up: California is drying up as the race to save the state from this epic drought continues. Some are looking to the Pacific Ocean for help.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: There are reports this evening that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) plans to drop its $45 billion bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable and it could come as early as tomorrow. The reports follow meetings between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission, Justice Department and executives from the cable companies. Shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), the parent company of CNBC which produces this company, rose a fraction. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell slightly.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it was good for investors in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin Brands. After the bell, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported an increase in sales at its coffee shops, calming concerns about cooling growth there.</p><p>And it was a big earnings beat from Dunkin Brands. That company also raised its outlook for the whole year.</p><p>That CEO attributed the strong quarter to a few factors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIGEL TRAVIS, DUNKIN BRANDS CEO: We had great innovation. We had new products. We had our products boost in loyalty, so we kicked it out to the park in the market side of the business, but nothing works unless our franchisees are open. And despite all the snow, our franchisees got their stores open.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares initially popped after the close, while shares of Dunkin had their best day ever, up 8 percent today.</p><p>We begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\" now with quarterly results from tech conglomerate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>That company reported a loss despite rising sales as they continue to spend heavily on projects like drone delivery. For the first time, it gave financial details about its secretive cloud computing business which posted revenue of about $1.5 billion. Guidance from the online retailer, though, was light for the futures. Shares there were volatile after the close. Stock ended the day up a fraction to $389.99.</p><p>And just one day after Coke reported strong results, Pepsi disappointed the street. The soda and snack giant says that it expects to take a bigger hit from foreign exchange in 2015, and more than expected, and that overshadowed the better than expected earnings and revenue results overall. Shares were, though, down 1.5 percent to $95.73.</p><p>Eli Lilly`s profits beat by a margin. They were boosted by a jump in sales of its animal health products. Lower spending on research and marketing also help the drug maker`s bottom line. But revenue slipped as the strong dollar hurt sales outside of the United States -- where have we heard that before. Shares were up a dime. It closed at $72.40.</p><p>HERERA: Dow Chemicals saw its earnings pop more than 40 percent as it focused on its high margin business that caters to the packaging and electronics industries. The company CEO explains how Dow managed to navigate around all of those headwinds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, DOW CHEMICAL CEO: We saw the same currency volatility. We saw the same oil price deflationary effects that are going on in lots of markets around the world. So, in terms of real-time growth - - you know, the bottom line matters, and we managed strong volume and good margin management through productivity and launching new products.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares closed up almost 2 percent to $51 per share.</p><p>Lower fuel prices helped United Continental post a record quarterly profit. But the airline carrier saw its sales dip and it cut its capacity forecast for 2015, as once again that strong dollar weaken demand from abroad. Shares slump almost 2 percent to $62.82.</p><p>Pulte Group surprised the street, not in a good way, though. The home builder saw its profits drop more than 20 percent as home closings fell and orders were soft. Part of the problem was the Northeast because of construction delays due to weather. Shares tumbled almost 8 percent to $19.97.</p><p>And Johnson and Johnson announced a dividend increase of about 7 percent to 75 cents a share. The company CEO says that increase is due to a strong financial position and confidence. The yield on the payout is now right about 3 percent. The stock was up a fraction to $100.46.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to the drought out west. California has for decades neglected to build new water infrastructure, no new reservoirs, no new dams. But now, everything is on the water table, if you will, even desalination, which removed salt from sea water.</p><p>Jane Wells reports from Carlsbad, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bone dry California sits next to the largest source of water in the world, the Pacific Ocean. Turning saltwater into fresh is expensive, requires a lot of energy and isn`t good for nearby fish, but California is running out of choices.</p><p>JESSICA JONES, POSEIDON WATER COMMUNITY OUTREACH: We are standing in the middle of the reverse osmosis plant.</p><p>WELLS: Jessica Jones is showing off the $1 billion desalination plant being built by Poseidon, which will come on the line later this year and provide 70 percent of the water to the San Diego County.</p><p>JONES: We`ll be producing 50 million gallons per day from this plant. Behind me is a 72-inch sea water feed line.</p><p>WELLS: Poseidon is financing the plant while San Diego has agreed to buy the water at a fixed price for 30 years.</p><p>JONES: Water from the desalination plant will be about the double the cost of imported water.</p><p>WELLS: That means water bills will go up an estimated 6 bucks a month for customer, but the plants price will never change and it will never run out of water. The water coming through this pipe will be pushed through fine filters to reduce the salt at 900 pounds per chance of pressure.</p><p>JONES: If that pipe were to break, water would shoot one mile into the air.</p><p>WELLS: It takes a tremendous amount of electricity to produce that kind of pressure, but the plant hopes to recapture some of the energy discharge in the process and use it as a sort of turbine to reduce costs.</p><p>JONES: The Carlsbad project has been under development since 2000. So, at that time, we were not in a drought in San Diego, or in California. But that has changed and we`re coming online at the perfect time.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): Now, this process does kill fish, but Jones says not as many as you may think, and it`s often the case with new developments, they are offsetting the damage they may do here by restoring some wet lands further down the coast. And while this may be the first plant, it won`t be the last. A dozen such desalination projects are being considered up and down the state.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Carlsbad, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Back to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) now, which reported a big miss on earnings this evening, the company has been working on the project called Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, which provides super fast Internet to small number of locations. One of those locations is Kansas City.</p><p>And as Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reports, many start-ups have flocked to the area because of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Internet connection may be blazing fast, but the rollout an entirely different story.</p><p>As Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber gears up to expand its footprint around the country, businesses have flocked to Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, to capitalize.</p><p>Google`s high speed Fiber product has brought entrepreneurs to the region from as far as Europe.</p><p>Jim Lysinger`s cloud-based business Bime Analytics relocated to the area from France in 2012. Three years later, he`s still waiting for Fiber to deliver.</p><p>JIM LYSINGER, BIME ANALYTICS: The business application hasn`t come as quickly as we had hoped. But certainly, we`re in the implementation process and we expect to have it here in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>ROGERS: But for those who have fiber, it has been a game-changer.</p><p>(on camera): Buffering is something you`re not going to see here in Kansas City, where Internet connectivity speeds are up to 100 times faster than what you see in homes across America, thanks to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber.</p><p>(voice-over): The hype around the high speed service is very real, but some are still figuring how to leverage it. It`s brought innovation to the region, with more than 100 start-ups launch in the past few years.</p><p>MATTHEW MARCUS, KC STARTUP VILLAGE CO-LEADER: When Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) chose Kansas City to bring Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, it was like it ignited passion and innovation just simply because they chose Kansas City, and people rallied around it. I mean, when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to your town and brings a brand new service that`s nowhere else in the world, you`re going to get excited about it.</p><p>ROGERS: The energy reminds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of another game- changer from the past.</p><p>RACHEL MERLO, GOOGLE FIBER COMMUNITY IMPACT MANAGER: What we`re seeing so far is looking a little bit like the early days of going from dialup to broadband. We didn`t really know what to expect, but the innovation followed.</p><p>ROGERS: And while there`s no set time line for Google`s rollout into five new cities, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh Durham, and Salt Lake City, both customers and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) agree, speed is what matters.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, in Kansas City, Kansas, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, with medical marijuana now legal in 23 states, one entrepreneur is hoping that she has found the next niche market. The final part of our \"Marijuana and Money\" series is next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Here is what to watch for tomorrow on the data front, we`ll have durable goods orders, an indicator of demand for big ticket manufactured items, earnings from Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), American Airlines, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are due out, and consumers will finally get their hands on those Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches.</p><p>That`s what`s on the agenda for Friday, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Whoo-hoo. Big day.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brazil`s state-run oil company Petrobras put a price finally on that massive corruption scandal that we told you about last night. The company which trades on the New York Stock Exchange will write off $17 billion due to losses from graft and overinflated assets. The disclosure came in Petrobras as first financial statement in more than eight months.</p><p>In an interview today with our Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, the company`s chief financial officer said those charges could get even bigger as the criminal investigation into the case expands.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVAN MONTEIRO, PETROBRAS CEO: That`s the best information that we have at this moment. But it`s impossible to say that you -- that this number will cover everything because information that we don`t have access or that -- or is available, all in the future, it`s impossible to know about that.</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: So, it`s possible there could be more down the road?</p><p>MONTEIRO: Or -- or more or less. We really don`t know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, some apparently had estimated the cost of the corruption would be greater it. It actually helped shares of Petrobras rising more than 5 percent today.</p><p>HERERA: And finally tonight, we all know that people spend a lot on their pets, to the tune of $58 billion last year. And with the legalized pot industry growing, some entrepreneurs have found a new niche market, pot for pets.</p><p>Dina Gusovsky has more in the final part of our series, \"Marijuana and Money.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sprout, do you want a treat? Do you want a treatable?</p><p>DINA GUSOVSKY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Sprout. She only has three legs and that`s one of the reasons her mom is feeding her marijuana.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are giving her treatables to help prevent arthritis down the road. A treatable is a dog treat or pet treat that is baked with CBD compound, which is the non-psychoactive substance of the cannabis plant.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: Dory suffers from separation anxiety. She gets these CBD treats daily.</p><p>As for the critics?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they would be crazy to give their dogs really strong pharmaceutical drugs that make them feel dopey and out of touch rather than happy and calm.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: Brother and sister Morgan and Emily Paxhia are investors Auntie Dolores, the maker of treatables.</p><p>JULIANNA CARELLA, AUNTIE DOLORES: They are actually delicious. They taste like Graham crackers. We`re not interested in getting our dogs high, but interested in providing a wellness regimen that is safe and nontoxic.</p><p>The idea is if adults can enjoy cannabis, animals should too, but we stick to the ones that are appropriate for them.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: And the kitchen has plenty of edibles for humans as well.</p><p>CARELLA: Last year, we sold about a quarter of a million units altogether.

The NASDAQ finally closes at a record, topping its dot-com era high. And tech earnings tonight, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could set the tone for tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Message to the market. What Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), three of the world's biggest global companies, are saying about the health of the world economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: And why this earnings season is turning out to be a big one for small caps.</p><p>All of that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, April the 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. I'm Bill Griffeth, in tonight for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>HERERA: And I'm Sue Herera.</p><p>The NASDAQ closed at an all-time high. We'll have more on that momentarily.</p><p>But we begin tonight with three of the world's biggest companies and what they are saying about the global economy.</p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the maker of construction and mining equipment, which reaches more than 180 countries, blew past earnings estimates. But it also issued a warning.</p><p>Procter and Gamble, the world's largest household product firms which touched consumers across the global said revenues fell from last year, a sign of weakening demand and perhaps something else.</p><p>And 3M (NYSE:MMM), a manufacturing conglomerate, cut its full year outlook.</p><p>Together these three companies are sending a message to the markets about the global economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA (voice-over): Giant multinationals, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), all Dow components, are feeling the effects of a stronger dollar, the freefall in oil prices, and geopolitical uncertainties.</p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) beat revenue and profit estimates, but says the road ahead looks bumpy. It's holding to 2016 sales projections of $50 billion, but lower oil prices have cut demand for Cats exploration equipment. Other sore spots include mining hardware, locomotives, and in China, construction equipment.</p><p>DOUG OBERHLEMAN, CATERPILLAR CHAIRMAN AND CEO: I'm going to be very realistic with you. We'll not repeat this quarter the rest of the year.</p><p>We've seen a real dichotomy here in the world. A U.S. growing fairly slowly but growing steadily and everywhere else, there is not much good news.</p><p>HERERA: In some locations it could get worse because Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has yet to feel the full impact of oil's free fall, and now, the Petrobras scandal in Brazil.</p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES: Brazil has sort of been a basket case. One thing to remember is that they're sort of a manana economy.</p><p>Our survey told us that North America will be better than expected. And that is going to continue. The next green shoot is going to come out of Europe. QE is going to make it happen.</p><p>HERERA: Europe's economic stimulus is one reason the dollar has strengthened though and 3M (NYSE:MMM) joins the chorus of companies blaming a stronger dollar when it missed earning estimates. 3M (NYSE:MMM), which makes post-its and coatings and ceramics, lowered its outlook for the rest of year.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) also said the dollar is hurting sales, which dropped by more than 8 percent. P&amp;G does about two-thirds of its business outside of North America. To cut cost, CFO Jon Moeller says it can change its product mix, source materials locally and work on efficiency.</p><p>JON MOELLER, PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CEO: The good news these are things we should do in the normal course of business and we just sharpen the focus and keep it going. It is part of everybody's job.</p><p>Obviously, markets like Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina are very difficult right now. We need to be selective where we are targeting growth.</p><p>HERERA: P&amp;G's biggest markets, the U.S. and China, are a little better off, and that's where they're hoping to find growth.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to another global brand which late today issued a big earnings beat. We're talking about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They reported a profit of 61 cents a share, 10 cents better than estimates and revenue also topped expectations, coming in at almost $22 billion as sales of its hardware and cloud computing products helped offset a decline in its Windows business.</p><p>And investors liked what they saw, obviously, with shares rising initially after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the one thing shareholders should pay attention to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It's the revenue Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated in the commercial side of the business where specifically the software it sells to companies, remember, that is the real bread and butter for the software giant. Wall Street expected $12.4 billion, with many expecting a real miss. So, that number was a welcome relief from the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bulls.</p><p>And that commercial division isn't growing as strongly as in prior quarters, thanks to certain headwinds, such as a rising dollar. But analysts say today's report was a step in the right direction for CEO Satya Nadella.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It was a different story for another big tech company, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The search giant reported earnings per share of $6.57, expectations were for $6.60. Revenue also missed, coming in at $17.3 billion, but up from a year ago, helped by a jump in the number of ads. Investors initially brushed off that miss and sent shares higher.</p><p>Jon Fortt takes a look at the report's key takeaway.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The most interesting thing out of Google's earnings report, YouTube. It turns out that property is performing better than a lot of people knew and the auto play ads on YouTube, people are watching them. That had been making Google's results look actually worse than they are because it looked like people were clicking on a bunch of ads that weren't paying out a lot of money. It turns out they were just enjoying watching the YouTube ads. That and tight expense controls at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) sent the stock up after hours.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And a little later in the program, we'll look at one of Google's big projects and how it's changing the game for some start-ups in the Midwest.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google's results could, of course, impact how the NASDAQ trades tomorrow. But after the record close today, its first all-time high in 15 years. By the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 20 points to 18,058, and there's NASDAQ rising about 20 points. That was enough to take the index to where it hasn't been since March of 2,000. We're at 5,056 now. And the S&amp;P just about closed at an all-time high, we're five points shy, up about five points today.</p><p>HERERA: The nation's biggest automaker hilting a speed bump. General Motors' recall issues are mostly behind it and solid sales in parts of the world, so expectations were pretty high. But the automaker missed analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, and that weighed on the shares. They were down more than 3 percent.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more now on the road ahead for GM.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For General Motors (NYSE:GM), another quarter of solid profits that left investors saying it's not good enough. The automaker made over $2 billion last quarter, but fell short of estimates. Blame it on currency issues in South America and higher than expected tax rate.</p><p>But the underlying business did well, with North America profits surging thanks to truck and SUV sales, and GM says it's on track to hit all of its financial targets this year. But still GM shares have stalled. On the company's earnings call, CEO Mary Barra downplayed the possibility of General Motors (NYSE:GM) merging with another automaker as some have suggested.</p><p>MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO: We have a well articulated plan. We're in the middle of executing that, and we're not going to entertain anything that distracts us from accomplishing that.</p><p>LEBEAU (on camera): A big part of GM's game plan is returning more cash to investors, which the company is doing through a higher dividend. So far, that move has failed to have a big impact on GM shares.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And from cars to trains now. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the largest U.S. rail, posted first quarter profits and sales below analyst estimate. The company cited congestion at West Coast ports and weak coal demand and it sent shares lower by more than 2 percent as a result.</p><p>But while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rails come under pressure, it's a different story for another transportation sector, trucks.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Trains versus trucks, are the tale of two emerging stories within transports. As the dollar strengthens and oil is stays weak, growth is shifting from transportation of commodities which trains haul, to more consumer related products to trucking's bread and butter. Analysts this dynamic is playing out in earnings.</p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, AVONDALE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: Rails are struggling to put mid-single-digit earnings growth together. On the other hand, the truckers or consumer-oriented, less industrial oriented, and a big beneficiary of cheap diesel fuel are posting phenomenal earnings growth.</p><p>BRENNAN: U.S. railroad earnings have been largely disappointing, due to falling demand and rising service cost. Take Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), which reported this morning. Until now, the Western had rock solid results, but the first quarter missed analyst estimates with volumes at 22 percent. That after Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) reported results that were even more disappointing than previously lowered guidance.</p><p>On the other hand, trucking demand is increasing as fuel costs fall. Companies like Knight Transportation (NYSE:KNX), Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ:WERN), J.B. Hunt and Marten Transport (NASDAQ:MRTN) have all beat on earnings, posting big year over year growth.</p><p>BROUGHTON: Of all of the companies that reported so far on the trucking space, we've seen an average increase in earnings of 45 percent. Of all the companies in the rail space that have already reported earnings, we've seen 12 percent if you include the Canadian, 10 percent if you include the Americans in earnings per rail. So, you pick your poison.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): For this Broughton and a number of others on Wall Street are recommending investors consider buying stocks, and steer clear of the rails.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: While much of the focus during earning season is on large companies, it's small caps that are seeing big results. According to FactSet, small cap companies have seen their earnings grow nearly 3.5 percent so far this season, with revenues up 5 percent last year, while large caps are seeing a drop of more than 3 percent. The reason is likely because of the strong dollar which small caps tend to be insolated from.</p><p>Joining us to talk about this is Stephen Wood, chief market strategist with Russell Investments.</p><p>Good to see you again, Stephen. Welcome.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Does it come down to something as simple as that, that small cap companies tend to be domestically based and so, they don't have that currency exposure?</p><p>WOOD: I think a large part is that. By definition they can be exposed to foreign markets but only U.S. markets. So, currency for them has really become a nonissue, at least in this current earnings season. Whereas, for large caps, with national exposure, euro, that becomes much more of an earnings consideration.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Where do you put small caps on the risk scale, Steve? I mean, are they riskier than if you want to invest in Europe? Everybody is investing in Europe right now because of this dollar currency exchange rate situation. Does that make the small caps riskier or not?</p><p>WOOD: Well, as a general statement, historically, we've seen small caps going to be volatile or riskier than many of the small large cap names. But I think the bigger issue in the U.S. one of valuation large or small. You know, markets are fully valued in the United States so valuation is something of a head wind even though the economy is improving and even though the Federal Reserve be very stimulative.</p><p>So, for our perspective, we do like Europe, we've upgraded Europe, and we think there is more opportunities based predominantly upon valuations in Europe.</p><p>HERERA: So, if we have pretty much full valuations, what does the upcoming quarter bode for the small cap stocks?</p><p>WOOD: I think small cap stock will probably continue in line with what we've seen in the first quarter with a little bit of a pickup. The first quarter, again, very, very cold and the winter played in. And we have the dollar which you mentioned appreciate considerably, but also, there was the oil story.</p><p>So, I think the second quarter will not look dissimilar from the first quarter, but by the backend of 2015, I think you're going to see a pick up of earnings in small cap and in large cap space. But I think the dollar is not an issue for the small cap, but it will continue to be something of an issue in large cap space.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly, if you were to invest in small cap, who are the winners here? Who would you go with?</p><p>WOOD: I think right now, we look at health care, which is insulated from all these other factors. We'd also look at financials, and I think we'd also want to look at areas of the consumer which are going to benefit from oil prices coming down, and with the dollar being a little bit more powerful, they can add to their consumption.</p><p>HERERA: Stephen, thanks so much.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Stephen Wood with Russell Investments.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up: California is drying up as the race to save the state from this epic drought continues. Some are looking to the Pacific Ocean for help.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: There are reports this evening that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) plans to drop its $45 billion bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable and it could come as early as tomorrow. The reports follow meetings between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission, Justice Department and executives from the cable companies. Shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), the parent company of CNBC which produces this company, rose a fraction. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell slightly.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it was good for investors in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin Brands. After the bell, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported an increase in sales at its coffee shops, calming concerns about cooling growth there.</p><p>And it was a big earnings beat from Dunkin Brands. That company also raised its outlook for the whole year.</p><p>That CEO attributed the strong quarter to a few factors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIGEL TRAVIS, DUNKIN BRANDS CEO: We had great innovation. We had new products. We had our products boost in loyalty, so we kicked it out to the park in the market side of the business, but nothing works unless our franchisees are open. And despite all the snow, our franchisees got their stores open.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares initially popped after the close, while shares of Dunkin had their best day ever, up 8 percent today.</p><p>We begin tonight's \"Market Focus\" now with quarterly results from tech conglomerate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>That company reported a loss despite rising sales as they continue to spend heavily on projects like drone delivery. For the first time, it gave financial details about its secretive cloud computing business which posted revenue of about $1.5 billion. Guidance from the online retailer, though, was light for the futures. Shares there were volatile after the close. Stock ended the day up a fraction to $389.99.</p><p>And just one day after Coke reported strong results, Pepsi disappointed the street. The soda and snack giant says that it expects to take a bigger hit from foreign exchange in 2015, and more than expected, and that overshadowed the better than expected earnings and revenue results overall. Shares were, though, down 1.5 percent to $95.73.</p><p>Eli Lilly's profits beat by a margin. They were boosted by a jump in sales of its animal health products. Lower spending on research and marketing also help the drug maker's bottom line. But revenue slipped as the strong dollar hurt sales outside of the United States -- where have we heard that before. Shares were up a dime. It closed at $72.40.</p><p>HERERA: Dow Chemicals saw its earnings pop more than 40 percent as it focused on its high margin business that caters to the packaging and electronics industries. The company CEO explains how Dow managed to navigate around all of those headwinds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, DOW CHEMICAL CEO: We saw the same currency volatility. We saw the same oil price deflationary effects that are going on in lots of markets around the world. So, in terms of real-time growth - - you know, the bottom line matters, and we managed strong volume and good margin management through productivity and launching new products.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares closed up almost 2 percent to $51 per share.</p><p>Lower fuel prices helped United Continental post a record quarterly profit. But the airline carrier saw its sales dip and it cut its capacity forecast for 2015, as once again that strong dollar weaken demand from abroad. Shares slump almost 2 percent to $62.82.</p><p>Pulte Group surprised the street, not in a good way, though. The home builder saw its profits drop more than 20 percent as home closings fell and orders were soft. Part of the problem was the Northeast because of construction delays due to weather. Shares tumbled almost 8 percent to $19.97.</p><p>And Johnson and Johnson announced a dividend increase of about 7 percent to 75 cents a share. The company CEO says that increase is due to a strong financial position and confidence. The yield on the payout is now right about 3 percent. The stock was up a fraction to $100.46.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to the drought out west. California has for decades neglected to build new water infrastructure, no new reservoirs, no new dams. But now, everything is on the water table, if you will, even desalination, which removed salt from sea water.</p><p>Jane Wells reports from Carlsbad, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bone dry California sits next to the largest source of water in the world, the Pacific Ocean. Turning saltwater into fresh is expensive, requires a lot of energy and isn't good for nearby fish, but California is running out of choices.</p><p>JESSICA JONES, POSEIDON WATER COMMUNITY OUTREACH: We are standing in the middle of the reverse osmosis plant.</p><p>WELLS: Jessica Jones is showing off the $1 billion desalination plant being built by Poseidon, which will come on the line later this year and provide 70 percent of the water to the San Diego County.</p><p>JONES: We'll be producing 50 million gallons per day from this plant. Behind me is a 72-inch sea water feed line.</p><p>WELLS: Poseidon is financing the plant while San Diego has agreed to buy the water at a fixed price for 30 years.</p><p>JONES: Water from the desalination plant will be about the double the cost of imported water.</p><p>WELLS: That means water bills will go up an estimated 6 bucks a month for customer, but the plants price will never change and it will never run out of water. The water coming through this pipe will be pushed through fine filters to reduce the salt at 900 pounds per chance of pressure.</p><p>JONES: If that pipe were to break, water would shoot one mile into the air.</p><p>WELLS: It takes a tremendous amount of electricity to produce that kind of pressure, but the plant hopes to recapture some of the energy discharge in the process and use it as a sort of turbine to reduce costs.</p><p>JONES: The Carlsbad project has been under development since 2000. So, at that time, we were not in a drought in San Diego, or in California. But that has changed and we're coming online at the perfect time.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): Now, this process does kill fish, but Jones says not as many as you may think, and it's often the case with new developments, they are offsetting the damage they may do here by restoring some wet lands further down the coast. And while this may be the first plant, it won't be the last. A dozen such desalination projects are being considered up and down the state.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Carlsbad, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Back to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) now, which reported a big miss on earnings this evening, the company has been working on the project called Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, which provides super fast Internet to small number of locations. One of those locations is Kansas City.</p><p>And as Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reports, many start-ups have flocked to the area because of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Internet connection may be blazing fast, but the rollout an entirely different story.</p><p>As Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber gears up to expand its footprint around the country, businesses have flocked to Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, to capitalize.</p><p>Google's high speed Fiber product has brought entrepreneurs to the region from as far as Europe.</p><p>Jim Lysinger's cloud-based business Bime Analytics relocated to the area from France in 2012. Three years later, he's still waiting for Fiber to deliver.</p><p>JIM LYSINGER, BIME ANALYTICS: The business application hasn't come as quickly as we had hoped. But certainly, we're in the implementation process and we expect to have it here in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>ROGERS: But for those who have fiber, it has been a game-changer.</p><p>(on camera): Buffering is something you're not going to see here in Kansas City, where Internet connectivity speeds are up to 100 times faster than what you see in homes across America, thanks to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber.</p><p>(voice-over): The hype around the high speed service is very real, but some are still figuring how to leverage it. It's brought innovation to the region, with more than 100 start-ups launch in the past few years.</p><p>MATTHEW MARCUS, KC STARTUP VILLAGE CO-LEADER: When Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) chose Kansas City to bring Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, it was like it ignited passion and innovation just simply because they chose Kansas City, and people rallied around it. I mean, when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to your town and brings a brand new service that's nowhere else in the world, you're going to get excited about it.</p><p>ROGERS: The energy reminds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of another game- changer from the past.</p><p>RACHEL MERLO, GOOGLE FIBER COMMUNITY IMPACT MANAGER: What we're seeing so far is looking a little bit like the early days of going from dialup to broadband. We didn't really know what to expect, but the innovation followed.</p><p>ROGERS: And while there's no set time line for Google's rollout into five new cities, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh Durham, and Salt Lake City, both customers and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) agree, speed is what matters.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, in Kansas City, Kansas, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, with medical marijuana now legal in 23 states, one entrepreneur is hoping that she has found the next niche market. The final part of our \"Marijuana and Money\" series is next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Here is what to watch for tomorrow on the data front, we'll have durable goods orders, an indicator of demand for big ticket manufactured items, earnings from Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), American Airlines, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are due out, and consumers will finally get their hands on those Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches.</p><p>That's what's on the agenda for Friday, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Whoo-hoo. Big day.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras put a price finally on that massive corruption scandal that we told you about last night. The company which trades on the New York Stock Exchange will write off $17 billion due to losses from graft and overinflated assets. The disclosure came in Petrobras as first financial statement in more than eight months.</p><p>In an interview today with our Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, the company's chief financial officer said those charges could get even bigger as the criminal investigation into the case expands.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVAN MONTEIRO, PETROBRAS CEO: That's the best information that we have at this moment. But it's impossible to say that you -- that this number will cover everything because information that we don't have access or that -- or is available, all in the future, it's impossible to know about that.</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: So, it's possible there could be more down the road?</p><p>MONTEIRO: Or -- or more or less. We really don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, some apparently had estimated the cost of the corruption would be greater it. It actually helped shares of Petrobras rising more than 5 percent today.</p><p>HERERA: And finally tonight, we all know that people spend a lot on their pets, to the tune of $58 billion last year. And with the legalized pot industry growing, some entrepreneurs have found a new niche market, pot for pets.</p><p>Dina Gusovsky has more in the final part of our series, \"Marijuana and Money.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sprout, do you want a treat? Do you want a treatable?</p><p>DINA GUSOVSKY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Sprout. She only has three legs and that's one of the reasons her mom is feeding her marijuana.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are giving her treatables to help prevent arthritis down the road. A treatable is a dog treat or pet treat that is baked with CBD compound, which is the non-psychoactive substance of the cannabis plant.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: Dory suffers from separation anxiety. She gets these CBD treats daily.</p><p>As for the critics?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they would be crazy to give their dogs really strong pharmaceutical drugs that make them feel dopey and out of touch rather than happy and calm.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: Brother and sister Morgan and Emily Paxhia are investors Auntie Dolores, the maker of treatables.</p><p>JULIANNA CARELLA, AUNTIE DOLORES: They are actually delicious. They taste like Graham crackers. We're not interested in getting our dogs high, but interested in providing a wellness regimen that is safe and nontoxic.</p><p>The idea is if adults can enjoy cannabis, animals should too, but we stick to the ones that are appropriate for them.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: And the kitchen has plenty of edibles for humans as well.</p><p>CARELLA: Last year, we sold about a quarter of a million units altogether. Our strawberry pretzels and this is our most popular products. I think we sold about 50,000 of these last year.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dina Gusovsky in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And last night, we told about a story offering a rare glimpse into the life of a marijuana farmer. That piece is on our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And I'm Bill Griffeth.

The NASDAQ finally closes at a record, topping its dot-com era high. And tech earnings tonight, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could set the tone for tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Message to the market. What Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), three of the world's biggest global companies, are saying about the health of the world economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: And why this earnings season is turning out to be a big one for small caps.</p><p>All of that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, April the 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. I'm Bill Griffeth, in tonight for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>HERERA: And I'm Sue Herera.</p><p>The NASDAQ closed at an all-time high. We'll have more on that momentarily.</p><p>But we begin tonight with three of the world's biggest companies and what they are saying about the global economy.</p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the maker of construction and mining equipment, which reaches more than 180 countries, blew past earnings estimates. But it also issued a warning.</p><p>Procter and Gamble, the world's largest household product firms which touched consumers across the global said revenues fell from last year, a sign of weakening demand and perhaps something else.</p><p>And 3M (NYSE:MMM), a manufacturing conglomerate, cut its full year outlook.</p><p>Together these three companies are sending a message to the markets about the global economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA (voice-over): Giant multinationals, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), all Dow components, are feeling the effects of a stronger dollar, the freefall in oil prices, and geopolitical uncertainties.</p><p>Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) beat revenue and profit estimates, but says the road ahead looks bumpy. It's holding to 2016 sales projections of $50 billion, but lower oil prices have cut demand for Cats exploration equipment. Other sore spots include mining hardware, locomotives, and in China, construction equipment.</p><p>DOUG OBERHLEMAN, CATERPILLAR CHAIRMAN AND CEO: I'm going to be very realistic with you. We'll not repeat this quarter the rest of the year.</p><p>We've seen a real dichotomy here in the world. A U.S. growing fairly slowly but growing steadily and everywhere else, there is not much good news.</p><p>HERERA: In some locations it could get worse because Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has yet to feel the full impact of oil's free fall, and now, the Petrobras scandal in Brazil.</p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES: Brazil has sort of been a basket case. One thing to remember is that they're sort of a manana economy.</p><p>Our survey told us that North America will be better than expected. And that is going to continue. The next green shoot is going to come out of Europe. QE is going to make it happen.</p><p>HERERA: Europe's economic stimulus is one reason the dollar has strengthened though and 3M (NYSE:MMM) joins the chorus of companies blaming a stronger dollar when it missed earning estimates. 3M (NYSE:MMM), which makes post-its and coatings and ceramics, lowered its outlook for the rest of year.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) also said the dollar is hurting sales, which dropped by more than 8 percent. P&amp;G does about two-thirds of its business outside of North America. To cut cost, CFO Jon Moeller says it can change its product mix, source materials locally and work on efficiency.</p><p>JON MOELLER, PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CEO: The good news these are things we should do in the normal course of business and we just sharpen the focus and keep it going. It is part of everybody's job.</p><p>Obviously, markets like Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina are very difficult right now. We need to be selective where we are targeting growth.</p><p>HERERA: P&amp;G's biggest markets, the U.S. and China, are a little better off, and that's where they're hoping to find growth.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to another global brand which late today issued a big earnings beat. We're talking about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They reported a profit of 61 cents a share, 10 cents better than estimates and revenue also topped expectations, coming in at almost $22 billion as sales of its hardware and cloud computing products helped offset a decline in its Windows business.</p><p>And investors liked what they saw, obviously, with shares rising initially after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the one thing shareholders should pay attention to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It's the revenue Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated in the commercial side of the business where specifically the software it sells to companies, remember, that is the real bread and butter for the software giant. Wall Street expected $12.4 billion, with many expecting a real miss. So, that number was a welcome relief from the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bulls.</p><p>And that commercial division isn't growing as strongly as in prior quarters, thanks to certain headwinds, such as a rising dollar. But analysts say today's report was a step in the right direction for CEO Satya Nadella.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It was a different story for another big tech company, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The search giant reported earnings per share of $6.57, expectations were for $6.60. Revenue also missed, coming in at $17.3 billion, but up from a year ago, helped by a jump in the number of ads. Investors initially brushed off that miss and sent shares higher.</p><p>Jon Fortt takes a look at the report's key takeaway.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The most interesting thing out of Google's earnings report, YouTube. It turns out that property is performing better than a lot of people knew and the auto play ads on YouTube, people are watching them. That had been making Google's results look actually worse than they are because it looked like people were clicking on a bunch of ads that weren't paying out a lot of money. It turns out they were just enjoying watching the YouTube ads. That and tight expense controls at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) sent the stock up after hours.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And a little later in the program, we'll look at one of Google's big projects and how it's changing the game for some start-ups in the Midwest.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google's results could, of course, impact how the NASDAQ trades tomorrow. But after the record close today, its first all-time high in 15 years. By the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 20 points to 18,058, and there's NASDAQ rising about 20 points. That was enough to take the index to where it hasn't been since March of 2,000. We're at 5,056 now. And the S&amp;P just about closed at an all-time high, we're five points shy, up about five points today.</p><p>HERERA: The nation's biggest automaker hilting a speed bump. General Motors' recall issues are mostly behind it and solid sales in parts of the world, so expectations were pretty high. But the automaker missed analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, and that weighed on the shares. They were down more than 3 percent.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more now on the road ahead for GM.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For General Motors (NYSE:GM), another quarter of solid profits that left investors saying it's not good enough. The automaker made over $2 billion last quarter, but fell short of estimates. Blame it on currency issues in South America and higher than expected tax rate.</p><p>But the underlying business did well, with North America profits surging thanks to truck and SUV sales, and GM says it's on track to hit all of its financial targets this year. But still GM shares have stalled. On the company's earnings call, CEO Mary Barra downplayed the possibility of General Motors (NYSE:GM) merging with another automaker as some have suggested.</p><p>MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO: We have a well articulated plan. We're in the middle of executing that, and we're not going to entertain anything that distracts us from accomplishing that.</p><p>LEBEAU (on camera): A big part of GM's game plan is returning more cash to investors, which the company is doing through a higher dividend. So far, that move has failed to have a big impact on GM shares.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And from cars to trains now. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the largest U.S. rail, posted first quarter profits and sales below analyst estimate. The company cited congestion at West Coast ports and weak coal demand and it sent shares lower by more than 2 percent as a result.</p><p>But while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rails come under pressure, it's a different story for another transportation sector, trucks.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Trains versus trucks, are the tale of two emerging stories within transports. As the dollar strengthens and oil is stays weak, growth is shifting from transportation of commodities which trains haul, to more consumer related products to trucking's bread and butter. Analysts this dynamic is playing out in earnings.</p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, AVONDALE PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: Rails are struggling to put mid-single-digit earnings growth together. On the other hand, the truckers or consumer-oriented, less industrial oriented, and a big beneficiary of cheap diesel fuel are posting phenomenal earnings growth.</p><p>BRENNAN: U.S. railroad earnings have been largely disappointing, due to falling demand and rising service cost. Take Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), which reported this morning. Until now, the Western had rock solid results, but the first quarter missed analyst estimates with volumes at 22 percent. That after Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) reported results that were even more disappointing than previously lowered guidance.</p><p>On the other hand, trucking demand is increasing as fuel costs fall. Companies like Knight Transportation (NYSE:KNX), Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ:WERN), J.B. Hunt and Marten Transport (NASDAQ:MRTN) have all beat on earnings, posting big year over year growth.</p><p>BROUGHTON: Of all of the companies that reported so far on the trucking space, we've seen an average increase in earnings of 45 percent. Of all the companies in the rail space that have already reported earnings, we've seen 12 percent if you include the Canadian, 10 percent if you include the Americans in earnings per rail. So, you pick your poison.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): For this Broughton and a number of others on Wall Street are recommending investors consider buying stocks, and steer clear of the rails.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: While much of the focus during earning season is on large companies, it's small caps that are seeing big results. According to FactSet, small cap companies have seen their earnings grow nearly 3.5 percent so far this season, with revenues up 5 percent last year, while large caps are seeing a drop of more than 3 percent. The reason is likely because of the strong dollar which small caps tend to be insolated from.</p><p>Joining us to talk about this is Stephen Wood, chief market strategist with Russell Investments.</p><p>Good to see you again, Stephen. Welcome.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Does it come down to something as simple as that, that small cap companies tend to be domestically based and so, they don't have that currency exposure?</p><p>WOOD: I think a large part is that. By definition they can be exposed to foreign markets but only U.S. markets. So, currency for them has really become a nonissue, at least in this current earnings season. Whereas, for large caps, with national exposure, euro, that becomes much more of an earnings consideration.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Where do you put small caps on the risk scale, Steve? I mean, are they riskier than if you want to invest in Europe? Everybody is investing in Europe right now because of this dollar currency exchange rate situation. Does that make the small caps riskier or not?</p><p>WOOD: Well, as a general statement, historically, we've seen small caps going to be volatile or riskier than many of the small large cap names. But I think the bigger issue in the U.S. one of valuation large or small. You know, markets are fully valued in the United States so valuation is something of a head wind even though the economy is improving and even though the Federal Reserve be very stimulative.</p><p>So, for our perspective, we do like Europe, we've upgraded Europe, and we think there is more opportunities based predominantly upon valuations in Europe.</p><p>HERERA: So, if we have pretty much full valuations, what does the upcoming quarter bode for the small cap stocks?</p><p>WOOD: I think small cap stock will probably continue in line with what we've seen in the first quarter with a little bit of a pickup. The first quarter, again, very, very cold and the winter played in. And we have the dollar which you mentioned appreciate considerably, but also, there was the oil story.</p><p>So, I think the second quarter will not look dissimilar from the first quarter, but by the backend of 2015, I think you're going to see a pick up of earnings in small cap and in large cap space. But I think the dollar is not an issue for the small cap, but it will continue to be something of an issue in large cap space.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly, if you were to invest in small cap, who are the winners here? Who would you go with?</p><p>WOOD: I think right now, we look at health care, which is insulated from all these other factors. We'd also look at financials, and I think we'd also want to look at areas of the consumer which are going to benefit from oil prices coming down, and with the dollar being a little bit more powerful, they can add to their consumption.</p><p>HERERA: Stephen, thanks so much.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Stephen Wood with Russell Investments.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up: California is drying up as the race to save the state from this epic drought continues. Some are looking to the Pacific Ocean for help.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: There are reports this evening that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) plans to drop its $45 billion bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable and it could come as early as tomorrow. The reports follow meetings between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission, Justice Department and executives from the cable companies. Shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), the parent company of CNBC which produces this company, rose a fraction. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell slightly.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it was good for investors in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin Brands. After the bell, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported an increase in sales at its coffee shops, calming concerns about cooling growth there.</p><p>And it was a big earnings beat from Dunkin Brands. That company also raised its outlook for the whole year.</p><p>That CEO attributed the strong quarter to a few factors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIGEL TRAVIS, DUNKIN BRANDS CEO: We had great innovation. We had new products. We had our products boost in loyalty, so we kicked it out to the park in the market side of the business, but nothing works unless our franchisees are open. And despite all the snow, our franchisees got their stores open.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares initially popped after the close, while shares of Dunkin had their best day ever, up 8 percent today.</p><p>We begin tonight's \"Market Focus\" now with quarterly results from tech conglomerate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>That company reported a loss despite rising sales as they continue to spend heavily on projects like drone delivery. For the first time, it gave financial details about its secretive cloud computing business which posted revenue of about $1.5 billion. Guidance from the online retailer, though, was light for the futures. Shares there were volatile after the close. Stock ended the day up a fraction to $389.99.</p><p>And just one day after Coke reported strong results, Pepsi disappointed the street. The soda and snack giant says that it expects to take a bigger hit from foreign exchange in 2015, and more than expected, and that overshadowed the better than expected earnings and revenue results overall. Shares were, though, down 1.5 percent to $95.73.</p><p>Eli Lilly's profits beat by a margin. They were boosted by a jump in sales of its animal health products. Lower spending on research and marketing also help the drug maker's bottom line. But revenue slipped as the strong dollar hurt sales outside of the United States -- where have we heard that before. Shares were up a dime. It closed at $72.40.</p><p>HERERA: Dow Chemicals saw its earnings pop more than 40 percent as it focused on its high margin business that caters to the packaging and electronics industries. The company CEO explains how Dow managed to navigate around all of those headwinds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, DOW CHEMICAL CEO: We saw the same currency volatility. We saw the same oil price deflationary effects that are going on in lots of markets around the world. So, in terms of real-time growth - - you know, the bottom line matters, and we managed strong volume and good margin management through productivity and launching new products.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares closed up almost 2 percent to $51 per share.</p><p>Lower fuel prices helped United Continental post a record quarterly profit. But the airline carrier saw its sales dip and it cut its capacity forecast for 2015, as once again that strong dollar weaken demand from abroad. Shares slump almost 2 percent to $62.82.</p><p>Pulte Group surprised the street, not in a good way, though. The home builder saw its profits drop more than 20 percent as home closings fell and orders were soft. Part of the problem was the Northeast because of construction delays due to weather. Shares tumbled almost 8 percent to $19.97.</p><p>And Johnson and Johnson announced a dividend increase of about 7 percent to 75 cents a share. The company CEO says that increase is due to a strong financial position and confidence. The yield on the payout is now right about 3 percent. The stock was up a fraction to $100.46.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to the drought out west. California has for decades neglected to build new water infrastructure, no new reservoirs, no new dams. But now, everything is on the water table, if you will, even desalination, which removed salt from sea water.</p><p>Jane Wells reports from Carlsbad, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bone dry California sits next to the largest source of water in the world, the Pacific Ocean. Turning saltwater into fresh is expensive, requires a lot of energy and isn't good for nearby fish, but California is running out of choices.</p><p>JESSICA JONES, POSEIDON WATER COMMUNITY OUTREACH: We are standing in the middle of the reverse osmosis plant.</p><p>WELLS: Jessica Jones is showing off the $1 billion desalination plant being built by Poseidon, which will come on the line later this year and provide 70 percent of the water to the San Diego County.</p><p>JONES: We'll be producing 50 million gallons per day from this plant. Behind me is a 72-inch sea water feed line.</p><p>WELLS: Poseidon is financing the plant while San Diego has agreed to buy the water at a fixed price for 30 years.</p><p>JONES: Water from the desalination plant will be about the double the cost of imported water.</p><p>WELLS: That means water bills will go up an estimated 6 bucks a month for customer, but the plants price will never change and it will never run out of water. The water coming through this pipe will be pushed through fine filters to reduce the salt at 900 pounds per chance of pressure.</p><p>JONES: If that pipe were to break, water would shoot one mile into the air.</p><p>WELLS: It takes a tremendous amount of electricity to produce that kind of pressure, but the plant hopes to recapture some of the energy discharge in the process and use it as a sort of turbine to reduce costs.</p><p>JONES: The Carlsbad project has been under development since 2000. So, at that time, we were not in a drought in San Diego, or in California. But that has changed and we're coming online at the perfect time.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): Now, this process does kill fish, but Jones says not as many as you may think, and it's often the case with new developments, they are offsetting the damage they may do here by restoring some wet lands further down the coast. And while this may be the first plant, it won't be the last. A dozen such desalination projects are being considered up and down the state.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Carlsbad, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Back to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) now, which reported a big miss on earnings this evening, the company has been working on the project called Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, which provides super fast Internet to small number of locations. One of those locations is Kansas City.</p><p>And as Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reports, many start-ups have flocked to the area because of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Internet connection may be blazing fast, but the rollout an entirely different story.</p><p>As Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber gears up to expand its footprint around the country, businesses have flocked to Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, to capitalize.</p><p>Google's high speed Fiber product has brought entrepreneurs to the region from as far as Europe.</p><p>Jim Lysinger's cloud-based business Bime Analytics relocated to the area from France in 2012. Three years later, he's still waiting for Fiber to deliver.</p><p>JIM LYSINGER, BIME ANALYTICS: The business application hasn't come as quickly as we had hoped. But certainly, we're in the implementation process and we expect to have it here in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>ROGERS: But for those who have fiber, it has been a game-changer.</p><p>(on camera): Buffering is something you're not going to see here in Kansas City, where Internet connectivity speeds are up to 100 times faster than what you see in homes across America, thanks to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber.</p><p>(voice-over): The hype around the high speed service is very real, but some are still figuring how to leverage it. It's brought innovation to the region, with more than 100 start-ups launch in the past few years.</p><p>MATTHEW MARCUS, KC STARTUP VILLAGE CO-LEADER: When Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) chose Kansas City to bring Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Fiber, it was like it ignited passion and innovation just simply because they chose Kansas City, and people rallied around it. I mean, when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to your town and brings a brand new service that's nowhere else in the world, you're going to get excited about it.</p><p>ROGERS: The energy reminds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of another game- changer from the past.</p><p>RACHEL MERLO, GOOGLE FIBER COMMUNITY IMPACT MANAGER: What we're seeing so far is looking a little bit like the early days of going from dialup to broadband. We didn't really know what to expect, but the innovation followed.</p><p>ROGERS: And while there's no set time line for Google's rollout into five new cities, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh Durham, and Salt Lake City, both customers and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) agree, speed is what matters.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, in Kansas City, Kansas, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, with medical marijuana now legal in 23 states, one entrepreneur is hoping that she has found the next niche market. The final part of our \"Marijuana and Money\" series is next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Here is what to watch for tomorrow on the data front, we'll have durable goods orders, an indicator of demand for big ticket manufactured items, earnings from Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), American Airlines, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are due out, and consumers will finally get their hands on those Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches.</p><p>That's what's on the agenda for Friday, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Whoo-hoo. Big day.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras put a price finally on that massive corruption scandal that we told you about last night. The company which trades on the New York Stock Exchange will write off $17 billion due to losses from graft and overinflated assets. The disclosure came in Petrobras as first financial statement in more than eight months.</p><p>In an interview today with our Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, the company's chief financial officer said those charges could get even bigger as the criminal investigation into the case expands.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVAN MONTEIRO, PETROBRAS CEO: That's the best information that we have at this moment. But it's impossible to say that you -- that this number will cover everything because information that we don't have access or that -- or is available, all in the future, it's impossible to know about that.</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: So, it's possible there could be more down the road?</p><p>MONTEIRO: Or -- or more or less. We really don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, some apparently had estimated the cost of the corruption would be greater it. It actually helped shares of Petrobras rising more than 5 percent today.</p><p>HERERA: And finally tonight, we all know that people spend a lot on their pets, to the tune of $58 billion last year. And with the legalized pot industry growing, some entrepreneurs have found a new niche market, pot for pets.</p><p>Dina Gusovsky has more in the final part of our series, \"Marijuana and Money.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sprout, do you want a treat? Do you want a treatable?</p><p>DINA GUSOVSKY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Sprout. She only has three legs and that's one of the reasons her mom is feeding her marijuana.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are giving her treatables to help prevent arthritis down the road. A treatable is a dog treat or pet treat that is baked with CBD compound, which is the non-psychoactive substance of the cannabis plant.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: Dory suffers from separation anxiety. She gets these CBD treats daily.</p><p>As for the critics?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they would be crazy to give their dogs really strong pharmaceutical drugs that make them feel dopey and out of touch rather than happy and calm.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: Brother and sister Morgan and Emily Paxhia are investors Auntie Dolores, the maker of treatables.</p><p>JULIANNA CARELLA, AUNTIE DOLORES: They are actually delicious. They taste like Graham crackers. We're not interested in getting our dogs high, but interested in providing a wellness regimen that is safe and nontoxic.</p><p>The idea is if adults can enjoy cannabis, animals should too, but we stick to the ones that are appropriate for them.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: And the kitchen has plenty of edibles for humans as well.</p><p>CARELLA: Last year, we sold about a quarter of a million units altogether. Our strawberry pretzels and this is our most popular products. I think we sold about 50,000 of these last year.</p><p>GUSOVSKY: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dina Gusovsky in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And last night, we told about a story offering a rare glimpse into the life of a marijuana farmer.

Disney`s earnings and revenue come in below expectations even though strong growth in several key areas were shown. What now for the widely held Dow component?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: U-turn. Tesla`s Elon Musk says he`s thinking of taking the automaker private and that sends investors on a wild ride.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: And bad breadth? The major indices are closing in on all-time highs again, but is the rally broad enough to keep the bull running?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and much more tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Tuesday, August the 7th.</p><p>HERERA: Already.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Stocks rise and inch closer to all-time highs. We`ll have more on that in just a bit.</p><p>But there was big news from a pair of big names today. We`ll start with Disney (NYSE:DIS). Earnings that were off the mark. The company did come in below earnings and revenue estimates, but it also had strong growth in studio, parks and broadcast units.</p><p>Here are the numbers. Disney (NYSE:DIS) earned $1.87 cents a share. That is an 8-cent miss and revenue was a little light and still $18 billion for the quarter. Shares initially fell sharply and then rebounded.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has the key takeaway for investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Disney (NYSE:DIS) fell short of analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, despite seeing revenue growth at every division, but consumer products with its studio division growing revenue by 20 percent on the strength of \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Incredibles 2\", two examples of the success of Disney`s acquisition, Marvel and Pixar.</p><p>In the earnings release, CEO Bob Iger focusing on his confidence for Disney`s acquisition, Fox, saying, we`re more enthusiastic about the Fox acquisition than ever and confident in our ability to fully leverage these assets.</p><p>The cable networks are still a weak spot. The segment operating income dropping by 5 percent which is a bit worse than expected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s turn to Bill Smead for more on all of this. He is the CEO of Smead Capital and a longtime shareholder of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and a big proponent of a company even though there have been questions for the last few years, Bill, about ESPN and the cable components which again showed some weakness this time around.</p><p>You sort of dismiss that as noise. Why?</p><p>BILL SMEAD, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO: Well, first of all, they`re a manager of a variety of brands and so what happens, just like when you run a good stock portfolio, there are certain stocks you own that are doing well temporarily and there are some that aren`t doing as well, and you just want to have a great majority doing well all the time and they`ve done that, and remember, these -- this stock was under tremendous pressure during this battle for these Fox assets and people were wondering if Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other futuristic competitors were going to put them out of business or something.</p><p>So it`s, you know, they made 18 percent more than last year in a year that`s been one of trial and tribulation.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>HERERA: So, is Wall Street`s reaction in the after hours when we said it dipped and then came back after Bob Iger did the conference call -- was that an overreaction?</p><p>SMEAD: Well, we would -- possibly, but here`s how we look at it. Disney (NYSE:DIS), you know, is a company that Warren Buffett said the biggest regret in his career was he owned it a long time ago and he sold it. So, there`s maybe 20 companies that literally are part of Americana and literally own the hearts and minds of a vast majority of people in the United States and around the world and this stock trades at a significant discount to the other companies, the Nikes and the Starbuckses and those kind of companies. The Microsofts, right?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>SMEAD: So, it trades at, say, a 25 percent discount to those all because of the fears of streaming, over the top and the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) world putting them out of business.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, I don`t think they`re going to put them out of business, but clearly, Bob Iger has made it clear that over the top video streaming is very important to the future of this company. They are setting it up. They`re pricing it. They`re getting it ready to take on the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>What do you think it will do for Disney (NYSE:DIS)?</p><p>SMEAD: Well, history tells us a little bit about this. People thought the VCR was going to mess them up. People thought cable was going to mess them up.</p><p>Content is always king, and they have the best manufacturing process for creating brands and content and then they`re also very astute bargain hunters for underperforming brands in content and that shouldn`t change much regardless of what the technology delivery system is.</p><p>HERERA: Are you -- are you, very quickly, Bill, are you happy with the way they`ve tried to turn ESPN around? I mean, Mr. Iger says there`s more to be done.</p><p>SMEAD: There is, but demographics play a big part in the slowdown in ESPN, and that is I`m 60. There are more 60-year-olds than there are 45-year- olds. Forty-five-year-old men are the bread and butter, there are just as many of them as there was 10 years ago.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>SMEAD: That will pick up in another 10 years and no one will be worrying about ESPN.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Sleep well, Bill Smead with Smead Capital Management. Thanks for joining us again tonight.</p><p>SMEAD: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: The other big name making news today is Tesla. CEO Elon Musk created quite a stir with a series of tweets saying he`s, quote, considering taking Tesla private at $420. Musk said no decision has been made yet, but added the current investors could hold on to their positions through a special fund or sell their shares at the $420 mark.</p><p>By the way, this would be the biggest buyout in history. Shares of Tesla were already on the rise on the report that Saudi Arabia took a $2 billion stake in the company, but then were halted following Musk`s tweet. They eventually reopened, finishing up 11 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Got that?</p><p>And that better than 10 percent move in Tesla helped spur the Nasdaq to its sixth straight day of gains. Overall, stocks rose as investors stayed focused on corporate earnings and the major indices just continue to inch closer to all time highs. The Dow today up 126 points to 25,628, the Nasdaq added 24, the S&amp;P tacked on eight points today.</p><p>HERERA: As of the close today, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P are within 1 percent of historic highs. The Dow stands about 3.5 percent away, all capable of breaking through on any given day.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes us on a ride to the top.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The markets are knocking on the door of historic highs once again. The S&amp;P 500 is less than 1 percent from the record high. How does he get here?</p><p>The market has been moving on a powerful combination of factors. First, the earnings story is still going strong for the second half of the year and for the third and fourth quarter, the guidance is not dropped at all. We`re still looking at gains of more than 20 percent for the third and fourth quarter. Those are big numbers.</p><p>Second, while a small group of companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) have fallen victim to these tariff issues, the vast majority of companies continue to see very little impact from the trade wars.</p><p>Third, there`s been a tidal wave of buybacks announced this year. The companies are flushed with cash and it`s a record $750 billion of buyback that`s been announced so far. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is expecting $1 trillion by the end of the year. That`s a jump of about 50 percent from last year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone has already bought back more than $40 billion in stock this year.</p><p>There`s also a market rotation under way. Despite the narrow rally, the market`s not been entirely dominated by technology. When tech falters, traders buy other sectors. So, recently, we`ve also seen defensive value- oriented sectors like healthcare and banks and especially consumer staples that have been strong in the last month.</p><p>Finally, the U.S. continues to show signs of strength in its economy. The GDP growth is looking to be well over 3 percent for the rest of 2018. So, the big question now is, what will it take to get the S&amp;P 500 over the finish line? We`re really close.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the question surrounding the market any time new highs are that close: is there enough support to keep the rally going?</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The major stock indexes are poised to return to record highs lasting more than six months ago, but one criticism of this rally remains popular, that the market is too reliant on a small group of big tech stocks for its recent gain? Is this true? Or is the climb broad enough to support further upside to new record highs?</p><p>There is some truth to the argument that the largest tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have driven much of the market`s gain. Roughly half of the increase of the S&amp;P 500 index has valued this year has come from those four stocks alone, and the technology sector as a whole is up more than 16 percent compared to the S&amp;P 500`s 7 percent rise, but it`s not true that those winners have obscured pervasive weakness below the surface.</p><p>The majority of all stocks are up for the year, the equal weighted version of the S&amp;P 500 in which each of the 500 stock has the same influence is up nearly 5 percent for 2018. More than twice as many large stocks are up 10 percent than have fallen that much. And a Russell 2000 small companies stock index has advanced some 10 percent.</p><p>So, while investors have become somewhat more selective than in last year`s inclusive surge, with the strong preference for fast-growing technology giant this year, it`s not clear that the market is skewed toward a small handful of winners at the expense of the majority of stocks. The reason investors do focus closely on the breakdown of market breadth is that major market peaks are often preceded by an extreme narrowing of the market with select big stocks holding up the indexes as the average stock suffers.</p><p>With the bull market that began in 2009 set to become the longest on record in the next few weeks, it makes sense to focus on these patterns. So far, at least, the rally seems just broad enough to fend off the bears.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So what will it take to get this market to the next level?</p><p>Scott Kubie, chief investment officer at the Carson Group joins us now to talk about that.</p><p>And I want to pick up on what mike kind of mentioned right at the end, and that`s the broadening out of the market because you also think that that`s important.</p><p>SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CIO: Yes. We`ve seen really great leadership in a small number of stocks, but I don`t think that`s going to get us to -- it may get us to new highs, but it`s not going to get us a really strong return over the rest of the year and we think that we need a broader participation especially from value stocks, which have really lagged growth stocks by a wide margin this year.</p><p>I think one of the nice things is we saw that in July where value stocks outperformed growth stocks by about a percent depending on the index you use, and that`s a very positive sign as we go into the second half of the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, assuming that we are in the late portion of the cycle here for this market. The value is the place where people often look and you`re telling us to look for this particular value ETF tonight, right?</p><p>KUBIE: Yes, one of the ETFs that we really like is the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 Value ETF and the ticker is ISUV. There are a number of great value ETFs out there, but one of the reasons we like it is that value stocks with cheap relative to growth on a valuation basis. Bbut also some of the sector allocations toward financials and energy look to us to be really attractive in the late cycle stage and we think the sectors are going to outperform in the second half of the year and into 2019.</p><p>HERERA: You also are dabbling in the energy sector National Oilwell, the ticker symbol is NOV. You would also be looking at that.</p><p>KUBIE: Yes. That`s an interesting story. The National Oilwell Varco is a supplier to a lot of the oil rig manufacturers. And so, as we`ve seen a strong, sustained rally in oil, it`s caused manufacturers to go out and to build more wells and hopefully order more equipment. And as the supplier to them, that late cycle stage is really very positive for them.</p><p>They also supply a lot to offshore drillers and that`s become much more competitive and we`ve seen the overall shale production run into some troubles in allowing oil prices to stay long for a long time.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>KUBIE: That`s a big help for the offshore drillers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Quickly, Scott, I want to get this one in because you talk about the financials and if we are in a late cycle, usually inflation will start to pick up. So, you`re looking at a TIPX SPDR here, as well, right?</p><p>KUBIE: Yes. I think this has had great risk reduction characteristics for two risks that faced the market. First, if the economy continues to stay strong and employment continues to stay strong, we have the risk of inflation picking up quite a bit, and so having some inflation protection makes a lot of sense. The other, though, is if we have these tariffs go through and that ultimately raises consumer prices, we may be in a situation where great interest rates may stay about the same, inflation may rise quite a bit, and the overall real rates would fall.</p><p>That would be especially positive for TIPX and that`s one of the reasons why we like them --</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>KUBIE: -- as a low-risk portion in your portfolio.</p><p>HERERA: Scott, thank you very much. Scott Kubie is with the Carson Group.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, job openings in the U.S. hovered near record highs in June. Job openings are a measure, of course, labor demand and they were unchanged in June at 6.7 million. The all-time high was the 6.8 million in April. The downside, the hiring rate slipped slightly.</p><p>HERERA: Last week`s employment report showed 157,000 jobs created in July and you can tack those on to the millions that have been created over the past decade, under two presidents, one a Democrat, the other a Republican, and both take credit for the number of jobs created. But exactly who or what is actually responsible?</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: How much do presidents have to do with job creation?</p><p>A look at the differences between President Obama and Trump shows sometimes a lot and sometimes not much at all. Under President Trump, 3.8 million jobs have been created or 190,000 per month, counting the 20 months starting after Trump`s election November 2016.</p><p>So in the prior 20 months of the Obama administration, that is from April 2015 to November 2016, 4.3 million jobs were created or a stronger 215,000 a month. So, strong job growth continued under Trump that began under Obama, and Trump has done well to keep it going, defying expectation of economists that it would slow because of a lack of workers.</p><p>Four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs have been added under Trump compared to just 21,000 for the 20 months under Obama. That`s a sign the president`s focus on manufacturing might be bearing some fruit, but it`s also mining and logging jobs which have grown by nearly 90,000 under Trump, but fell by almost 200,000 under Obama. This could be the result of policy to deregulate the industry, but just as easily economists say the result of higher oil prices, spurring U.S. production now versus oil prices that reduced production under Obama.</p><p>And there are some places where the trend under Obama simply continued under Trump. The transportation jobs remain as strong as they were, along with professional and business services, along with education and health care.</p><p>Some job growth however has nothing to do with presidents. More government jobs were created under Obama than Trump. But the biggest part of that difference, local and state hiring over which presidents have little control.</p><p>So, there are definitely positive trends in the job market, all of which most presidents will entirely take credit for, and they will be as they`ve always been, just partially right.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with Argus, cutting its rating on CBS (NYSE:CBS) from buy to hold. The analysts noting significant risk to those sexual allegations against CEO Les Moonves, including his possible termination. In fact, the possibility that if Moonves were to be fired, the board may drop its fight with the Redstone family to merge CBS (NYSE:CBS) with Viacom (NYSE:VIA) and Argus believes if they were to merge, it would be a negative for shareholders. Shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) closed at $53.22, up a fraction today.</p><p>SeaWorld was upgraded at Macquarie from underweight to hold following the company`s strong earnings report. Macquarie says that SeaWorld`s management is executing well and attendance growth in the first half of the year was impressive. The price target was raised from $10 to $26 and today`s SeaWorld shares closed at $25.58, up nearly 4 percent.</p><p>HERERA: Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was cut at Argus from buy to hold on concerns about gaming revenue growth in Macao. Argus also lowered its earnings outlook on Wynn for both this year and next, when shares climbed just a fraction to $153.29.</p><p>And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Zillow from buy to neutral, citing concerns over the business model shift following the company`s purchase of mortgage lenders of America. The analysts say that could hurt Zillow`s profits in fiscal 2019. The price target was also lower to $60 to $70. Today, Zillow closed at $49.40, down 16 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up, trying to contain what has become California`s largest wildfire ever.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Firefighters in California continue to battle what has turned into that state`s largest fire in its history. Eight major blazes are ravaging California`s landscape and have caused seven deaths and thousands of evacuations.</p><p>Aditi Roy joins us tonight from Ukiah, California.</p><p>Good evening, Aditi.</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Sue.</p><p>That`s right, we are at the staging area for the Mendocino Complex Fire. It is, as you mentioned, the largest wildfire in California history, nearly the size of the city of Los Angeles and it is growing at unprecedented rate. Of the fire, it`s actually comprised of two fires, the River Fire and the Ranch Fire.</p><p>The Ranch Fire is the bigger of the two. It is more than 240,000 acres and just more than 20 percent contained. Eleven thousand three hundred structures are threatened, 75 homes and businesses destroyed and 13,000 people have been ordered to evacuate. An additional 8,000 have been advised to do so.</p><p>Fire officials tell us the weather conditions combined with the remote location of the flames make it an especially tough fire fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE KAUFMANN, CAL FIRE SPOKESMAN: It`s been a challenge for us to get our crews in there because it`s in a mountain range and a ridge top, and so, we`re still currently trying to get good, active containment line in those areas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROY: There`s nearly 4,000 firefighters here on scene and they have dumped more than 100 million gallons of fire retardant, Sue, a massive show of manpower and resources.</p><p>HERERA: Indeed. Thank you so much, Aditi. Aditi Roy tonight.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Profits disappointed at Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA), and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The entertainment giant said restructuring costs tied to its recent acquisition of Scripts Network caused it to decline at a faster than expected clip, revenue was a beat, though, helped by higher sales in the company`s international networks. Shares closed down 5 percent to $25.55.</p><p>Dairy producer Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) reported a loss but did see sales inch ahead of expectations. The company also slashed its earnings outlook for the whole year citing inflationary pressures and growing competition from private labels. Shares plunged by 15 percent today to $8.04.</p><p>HERERA: More bad news from Papa John`s. After the closing bell, the pizza chain said same-store sales declined across its U.S. stores causing earnings to come up short. Papa John`s sees more pain ahead. It cut its outlook for the full year.</p><p>The company`s founder recently stepped down from his chairman role after he apologized for using a racial slur during a conference call. Shares fell in the after-hours and also finished the regular down nearly 3 percent to $41.07.</p><p>And after the bell, Snap reported a decline on the number of active daily users on its platform. Despite using estimates for user growth, the social media company beat earnings expectations which it said were helped by strong performance in its ad business. Also, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said that he has bought a more than 2 percent stake in the company. Shares initially jumped in the extended session but then fell back. They ended the regular day up half a percent to $13.12.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, things were slowly getting become to normal today after Beijing`s financial district was locked down amid protests. The catalyst was a meltdown in China`s peer to peer lending market.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing to shed some light on this growing crisis there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was business as usual in Beijing`s financial district today after yesterday`s police crackdown on protesters. Organizers say thousands of people gathered outside the banking regulator`s office. Hundreds of police stopped the demonstration.</p><p>The protesters were angry about money they lost in a peer to peer lending industry. Here in China it`s still very difficult for ordinary people to get loans from mainstream banks, so this whole industry of peer to peer lending has emerged where investors who have money to lend are connected to people who need capital to start businesses or just to buy something. This industry has grown quickly over the past few years, thanks to the high returns, about 8 percent to 12 percent compared to less than 3 percent at most traditional banks.</p><p>But because of title regulatory conditions and a liquidity crunch, some of the lenders have started to fail. In China, public protesters aren`t common, but it is common for investors who lose money to expect the government to bail them out and that is what the protesters were seeking yesterday.</p><p>The troubles for the P2P are far from over. There are concerns that the P2P problems can spread to business in other sectors. In the past week, two companies, one router manufacturer and one convenience store chain reported financials associated with P2P investments. That would pose a headache for Beijing which is struggling have a rising debt and the risk associated with it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, a $54 billion merger faces resistance from within.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Cigna`s proposed $54 billion deal to buy Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts is running into resistance from its highest profile investor. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn released an open letter urging his fellow shareholders to vote against Cigna`s deal to buy the pharmacy benefits manager. Cigna responded by saying that Mr. Icahn`s view does not represent those of Cigna`s other shareholders.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has been following the drama for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Carl Icahn called Cigna`s megadeal to acquire pharmacy benefits firm Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts a $60 billion folly. The activist investor who has taken a stake in Cigna is urging others to vote against the deal, arguing that the insurers paying a 50 percent premium for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts at a time when the pharmacy management business model is under siege from regulators to the secretary of health and others who have been critical of confidential rebate agreements which allow the PBMs to secure discounts from drugmakers.</p><p>Icahn also argues that Amazon`s entrance into the pharmacy business recently acquiring PillPack will also undermine the deal. In his letter, Icahn warns purchasing Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts would be one of the worst blunders in corporate history, up there with the Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)-AOL (NYSE:AOL) fiasco and General Electric (NYSE:GE) valued destruction.</p><p>Icahn believed Cigna would be better off building its own pharmacy unit and returning cash to shareholders.</p><p>But Leerink analyst Ana Gupta who raised Cigna an outperform called Icahn`s proposals unrealistic. She argues it would be a challenge for Cigna to build a pharmacy unit with enough scale and that integrating medical and pharmacy benefits is what will help insurers and PBM defend against the pushback on rebates and against new entrants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who will only have one piece of the puzzle for now.</p><p>In response to Icahn, a spokesman for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts said: We believe that we are well-positioned for growth and remain confident in the deal -- noting that they raised their guidance for client retention in the recent earnings report. Cigna declined to comment on the Icahn letter but CEO David Cordani expressed confidence the deal would get done on last week`s earnings conference call.</p><p>Icahn also suggested that the only Cigna shareholders who have reason to support the deal are those who also own shares of Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts.

Disney's  earnings and revenue come in below expectations even though strong growth  in several key areas were shown.  What now for the widely held Dow  component?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  U-turn.  Tesla's Elon Musk  says he's thinking of taking the automaker private and that sends investors  on a wild ride.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  And bad breadth?  The major indices are closing in on all-time  highs again, but is the rally broad enough to keep the bull running?  </p><p>All that and much more tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Tuesday, August the 7th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Already.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Stocks rise and inch closer to all-time highs.  We'll have more on that in  just a bit.</p><p>But there was big news from a pair of big names today.  We'll start with  Disney (NYSE:DIS).  Earnings that were off the mark.  The company did come  in below earnings and revenue estimates, but it also had strong growth in  studio, parks and broadcast units.  </p><p>Here are the numbers.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) earned $1.87 cents a share.  That  is an 8-cent miss and revenue was a little light and still $18 billion for  the quarter.  Shares initially fell sharply and then rebounded.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has the key takeaway for investors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  fell short of analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, despite  seeing revenue growth at every division, but consumer products with its  studio division growing revenue by 20 percent on the strength of \"Avengers:  Infinity War\" and \"Incredibles 2\", two examples of the success of Disney's  acquisition, Marvel and Pixar.  </p><p>In the earnings release, CEO Bob Iger focusing on his confidence for  Disney's acquisition, Fox, saying, we're more enthusiastic about the Fox  acquisition than ever and confident in our ability to fully leverage these  assets.  </p><p>The cable networks are still a weak spot.  The segment operating income  dropping by 5 percent which is a bit worse than expected.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let's turn to Bill Smead for more on all of this.  He is the CEO  of Smead Capital and a longtime shareholder of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and a big  proponent of a company even though there have been questions for the last  few years, Bill, about ESPN and the cable components which again showed  some weakness this time around.  </p><p>You sort of dismiss that as noise.  Why?  </p><p>BILL SMEAD, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, first of all, they're a  manager of a variety of brands and so what happens, just like when you run  a good stock portfolio, there are certain stocks you own that are doing  well temporarily and there are some that aren't doing as well, and you just  want to have a great majority doing well all the time and they've done  that, and remember, these -- this stock was under tremendous pressure  during this battle for these Fox assets and people were wondering if  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other futuristic competitors were going to put  them out of business or something.  </p><p>So it's, you know, they made 18 percent more than last year in a year  that's been one of trial and tribulation.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, is Wall Street's reaction in the after hours when we said it  dipped and then came back after Bob Iger did the conference call -- was  that an overreaction?  </p><p>SMEAD:  Well, we would -- possibly, but here's how we look at it.  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), you know, is a company that Warren Buffett said the biggest  regret in his career was he owned it a long time ago and he sold it.  So,  there's maybe 20 companies that literally are part of Americana and  literally own the hearts and minds of a vast majority of people in the  United States and around the world and this stock trades at a significant  discount to the other companies, the Nikes and the Starbuckses and those  kind of companies.  The Microsofts, right?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SMEAD:  So, it trades at, say, a 25 percent discount to those all because  of the fears of streaming, over the top and the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) world  putting them out of business.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, I don't think they're going to put them out of business,  but clearly, Bob Iger has made it clear that over the top video streaming  is very important to the future of this company.  They are setting it up.   They're pricing it.  They're getting it ready to take on the likes of  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  </p><p>What do you think it will do for Disney (NYSE:DIS)?  </p><p>SMEAD:  Well, history tells us a little bit about this.  People thought the  VCR was going to mess them up.  People thought cable was going to mess them  up.  </p><p>Content is always king, and they have the best manufacturing process for  creating brands and content and then they're also very astute bargain  hunters for underperforming brands in content and that shouldn't change  much regardless of what the technology delivery system is.  </p><p>HERERA:  Are you -- are you, very quickly, Bill, are you happy with the way  they've tried to turn ESPN around?  I mean, Mr. Iger says there's more to  be done.  </p><p>SMEAD:  There is, but demographics play a big part in the slowdown in ESPN,  and that is I'm 60.  There are more 60-year-olds than there are 45-year- olds.  Forty-five-year-old men are the bread and butter, there are just as  many of them as there was 10 years ago.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SMEAD:  That will pick up in another 10 years and no one will be worrying  about ESPN.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Sleep well, Bill Smead with Smead Capital Management.  Thanks  for joining us again tonight.  </p><p>SMEAD:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  The other big name making news today is Tesla.  CEO Elon Musk  created quite a stir with a series of tweets saying he's, quote,  considering taking Tesla private at $420.  Musk said no decision has been  made yet, but added the current investors could hold on to their positions  through a special fund or sell their shares at the $420 mark.  </p><p>By the way, this would be the biggest buyout in history.  Shares of Tesla  were already on the rise on the report that Saudi Arabia took a $2 billion  stake in the company, but then were halted following Musk's tweet.  They  eventually reopened, finishing up 11 percent.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Got that?  </p><p>And that better than 10 percent move in Tesla helped spur the Nasdaq to its  sixth straight day of gains.  Overall, stocks rose as investors stayed  focused on corporate earnings and the major indices just continue to inch  closer to all time highs.  The Dow today up 126 points to 25,628, the  Nasdaq added 24, the S&amp;P tacked on eight points today.  </p><p>HERERA:  As of the close today, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P are within 1 percent  of historic highs.  The Dow stands about 3.5 percent away, all capable of  breaking through on any given day.  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes us on a ride to the top.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The markets are  knocking on the door of historic highs once again.  The S&amp;P 500 is less  than 1 percent from the record high.  How does he get here?  </p><p>The market has been moving on a powerful combination of factors.  First,  the earnings story is still going strong for the second half of the year  and for the third and fourth quarter, the guidance is not dropped at all.   We're still looking at gains of more than 20 percent for the third and  fourth quarter.  Those are big numbers.  </p><p>Second, while a small group of companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) have fallen victim to these tariff issues, the vast  majority of companies continue to see very little impact from the trade  wars.  </p><p>Third, there's been a tidal wave of buybacks announced this year.  The  companies are flushed with cash and it's a record $750 billion of buyback  that's been announced so far.  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is expecting $1  trillion by the end of the year.  That's a jump of about 50 percent from  last year.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone has already bought back more than $40  billion in stock this year.  </p><p>There's also a market rotation under way.  Despite the narrow rally, the  market's not been entirely dominated by technology.  When tech falters,  traders buy other sectors.  So, recently, we've also seen defensive value- oriented sectors like healthcare and banks and especially consumer staples  that have been strong in the last month.  </p><p>Finally, the U.S. continues to show signs of strength in its economy.  The  GDP growth is looking to be well over 3 percent for the rest of 2018.  So,  the big question now is, what will it take to get the S&amp;P 500 over the  finish line?  We're really close.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the question surrounding the market any time new highs are  that close: is there enough support to keep the rally going?  </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look for us.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The major stock  indexes are poised to return to record highs lasting more than six months  ago, but one criticism of this rally remains popular, that the market is  too reliant on a small group of big tech stocks for its recent gain?  Is  this true?  Or is the climb broad enough to support further upside to new  record highs?  </p><p>There is some truth to the argument that the largest tech stocks such as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) have driven much of the market's gain.  Roughly half of the  increase of the S&amp;P 500 index has valued this year has come from those four  stocks alone, and the technology sector as a whole is up more than 16  percent compared to the S&amp;P 500's 7 percent rise, but it's not true that  those winners have obscured pervasive weakness below the surface.  </p><p>The majority of all stocks are up for the year, the equal weighted version  of the S&amp;P 500 in which each of the 500 stock has the same influence is up  nearly 5 percent for 2018.  More than twice as many large stocks are up 10  percent than have fallen that much.  And a Russell 2000 small companies  stock index has advanced some 10 percent.  </p><p>So, while investors have become somewhat more selective than in last year's  inclusive surge, with the strong preference for fast-growing technology  giant this year, it's not clear that the market is skewed toward a small  handful of winners at the expense of the majority of stocks.  The reason  investors do focus closely on the breakdown of market breadth is that major  market peaks are often preceded by an extreme narrowing of the market with  select big stocks holding up the indexes as the average stock suffers.  </p><p>With the bull market that began in 2009 set to become the longest on record  in the next few weeks, it makes sense to focus on these patterns.  So far,  at least, the rally seems just broad enough to fend off the bears.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So what will it take to get this market to the next level?  </p><p>Scott Kubie, chief investment officer at the Carson Group joins us now to  talk about that.</p><p>And I want to pick up on what mike kind of mentioned right at the end, and  that's the broadening out of the market because you also think that that's  important.  </p><p>SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CIO:  Yes.  We've seen really great leadership in  a small number of stocks, but I don't think that's going to get us to -- it  may get us to new highs, but it's not going to get us a really strong  return over the rest of the year and we think that we need a broader  participation especially from value stocks, which have really lagged growth  stocks by a wide margin this year.</p><p>I think one of the nice things is we saw that in July where value stocks  outperformed growth stocks by about a percent depending on the index you  use, and that's a very positive sign as we go into the second half of the  year.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, assuming that we are in the late portion of the cycle here  for this market.  The value is the place where people often look and you're  telling us to look for this particular value ETF tonight, right?  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes, one of the ETFs that we really like is the iShares Core S&amp;P  500 Value ETF and the ticker is ISUV.  There are a number of great value  ETFs out there, but one of the reasons we like it is that value stocks with  cheap relative to growth on a valuation basis.  Bbut also some of the  sector allocations toward financials and energy look to us to be really  attractive in the late cycle stage and we think the sectors are going to  outperform in the second half of the year and into 2019.  </p><p>HERERA:  You also are dabbling in the energy sector National Oilwell, the  ticker symbol is NOV.  You would also be looking at that.  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes.  That's an interesting story.  The National Oilwell Varco is a  supplier to a lot of the oil rig manufacturers.  And so, as we've seen a  strong, sustained rally in oil, it's caused manufacturers to go out and to  build more wells and hopefully order more equipment.  And as the supplier  to them, that late cycle stage is really very positive for them.  </p><p>They also supply a lot to offshore drillers and that's become much more  competitive and we've seen the overall shale production run into some  troubles in allowing oil prices to stay long for a long time.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>KUBIE:  That's a big help for the offshore drillers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Quickly, Scott, I want to get this one in because you talk about  the financials and if we are in a late cycle, usually inflation will start  to pick up.  So, you're looking at a TIPX SPDR here, as well, right?  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes.  I think this has had great risk reduction characteristics for  two risks that faced the market.  First, if the economy continues to stay  strong and employment continues to stay strong, we have the risk of  inflation picking up quite a bit, and so having some inflation protection  makes a lot of sense.  The other, though, is if we have these tariffs go  through and that ultimately raises consumer prices, we may be in a  situation where great interest rates may stay about the same, inflation may  rise quite a bit, and the overall real rates would fall.  </p><p>That would be especially positive for TIPX and that's one of the reasons  why we like them --  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>KUBIE:  -- as a low-risk portion in your portfolio.  </p><p>HERERA:  Scott, thank you very much.  Scott Kubie is with the Carson Group.  </p><p>Bill?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, job openings in the U.S. hovered near record highs in  June.  Job openings are a measure, of course, labor demand and they were  unchanged in June at 6.7 million.  The all-time high was the 6.8 million in  April.  The downside, the hiring rate slipped slightly.  </p><p>HERERA:  Last week's employment report showed 157,000 jobs created in July  and you can tack those on to the millions that have been created over the  past decade, under two presidents, one a Democrat, the other a Republican,  and both take credit for the number of jobs created.  But exactly who or  what is actually responsible?  </p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  How much do  presidents have to do with job creation?  </p><p>A look at the differences between President Obama and Trump shows sometimes  a lot and sometimes not much at all.  Under President Trump, 3.8 million  jobs have been created or 190,000 per month, counting the 20 months  starting after Trump's election November 2016.  </p><p>So in the prior 20 months of the Obama administration, that is from April  2015 to November 2016, 4.3 million jobs were created or a stronger 215,000  a month.  So, strong job growth continued under Trump that began under  Obama, and Trump has done well to keep it going, defying expectation of  economists that it would slow because of a lack of workers. </p><p>Four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs have been added under Trump  compared to just 21,000 for the 20 months under Obama.  That's a sign the  president's focus on manufacturing might be bearing some fruit, but it's  also mining and logging jobs which have grown by nearly 90,000 under Trump,  but fell by almost 200,000 under Obama.  This could be the result of policy  to deregulate the industry, but just as easily economists say the result of  higher oil prices, spurring U.S. production now versus oil prices that  reduced production under Obama.  </p><p>And there are some places where the trend under Obama simply continued  under Trump.  The transportation jobs remain as strong as they were, along  with professional and business services, along with education and health  care.  </p><p>Some job growth however has nothing to do with presidents.  More government  jobs were created under Obama than Trump.  But the biggest part of that  difference, local and state hiring over which presidents have little  control.  </p><p>So, there are definitely positive trends in the job market, all of which  most presidents will entirely take credit for, and they will be as they've  always been, just partially right.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>We begin with Argus, cutting its rating on CBS (NYSE:CBS) from buy to hold.   The analysts noting significant risk to those sexual allegations against  CEO Les Moonves, including his possible termination.  In fact, the  possibility that if Moonves were to be fired, the board may drop its fight  with the Redstone family to merge CBS (NYSE:CBS) with Viacom (NYSE:VIA) and  Argus believes if they were to merge, it would be a negative for  shareholders.  Shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) closed at $53.22, up a fraction  today.  </p><p>SeaWorld was upgraded at Macquarie from underweight to hold following the  company's strong earnings report.

The  analysts say that could hurt Zillow's profits in fiscal 2019.  The price  target was also lower to $60 to $70.

Eight major blazes are ravaging  California's landscape and have caused seven deaths and thousands of  evacuations.  </p><p>Aditi Roy joins us tonight from Ukiah, California.  </p><p>Good evening, Aditi.</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening to you,  Sue.</p><p>That's right, we are at the staging area for the Mendocino Complex Fire.   It is, as you mentioned, the largest wildfire in California history, nearly  the size of the city of Los Angeles and it is growing at unprecedented  rate.  Of the fire, it's actually comprised of two fires, the River Fire  and the Ranch Fire.  </p><p>The Ranch Fire is the bigger of the two.  It is more than 240,000 acres and  just more than 20 percent contained.  Eleven thousand three hundred  structures are threatened, 75 homes and businesses destroyed and 13,000  people have been ordered to evacuate.  An additional 8,000 have been  advised to do so.  </p><p>Fire officials tell us the weather conditions combined with the remote  location of the flames make it an especially tough fire fight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE KAUFMANN, CAL FIRE SPOKESMAN:  It's been a challenge for us to get  our crews in there because it's in a mountain range and a ridge top, and  so, we're still currently trying to get good, active containment line in  those areas.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROY:  There's nearly 4,000 firefighters here on scene and they have dumped  more than 100 million gallons of fire retardant, Sue, a massive show of  manpower and resources.  </p><p>HERERA:  Indeed.

Aditi Roy tonight.  </p><p>Bill?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Profits disappointed at Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA),  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The entertainment giant said restructuring costs tied to its recent  acquisition of Scripts Network caused it to decline at a faster than  expected clip, revenue was a beat, though, helped by higher sales in the  company's international networks.  Shares closed down 5 percent to $25.55.  </p><p>Dairy producer Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) reported a loss but did see sales inch  ahead of expectations.  The company also slashed its earnings outlook for  the whole year citing inflationary pressures and growing competition from  private labels.

Shares fell  in the after-hours and also finished the regular down nearly 3 percent to  $41.07.  </p><p>And after the bell, Snap reported a decline on the number of active daily  users on its platform.

Also, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin  Talal said that he has bought a more than 2 percent stake in the company.   Shares initially jumped in the extended session but then fell back.  They  ended the regular day up half a percent to $13.12.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, things were slowly getting become to normal today after  Beijing's financial district was locked down amid protests.  The catalyst  was a meltdown in China's peer to peer lending market.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing to shed some light on this growing crisis there.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was business as  usual in Beijing's financial district today after yesterday's police  crackdown on protesters.  Organizers say thousands of people gathered  outside the banking regulator's office.  Hundreds of police stopped the  demonstration.  </p><p>The protesters were angry about money they lost in a peer to peer lending  industry.  Here in China it's still very difficult for ordinary people to  get loans from mainstream banks, so this whole industry of peer to peer  lending has emerged where investors who have money to lend are connected to  people who need capital to start businesses or just to buy something.  This  industry has grown quickly over the past few years, thanks to the high  returns, about 8 percent to 12 percent compared to less than 3 percent at  most traditional banks.</p><p>But because of title regulatory conditions and a liquidity crunch, some of  the lenders have started to fail.  In China, public protesters aren't  common, but it is common for investors who lose money to expect the  government to bail them out and that is what the protesters were seeking  yesterday.  </p><p>The troubles for the P2P are far from over.  There are concerns that the  P2P problems can spread to business in other sectors.  In the past week,  two companies, one router manufacturer and one convenience store chain  reported financials associated with P2P investments.  That would pose a  headache for Beijing which is struggling have a rising debt and the risk  associated with it.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, a $54 billion merger faces resistance from within.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Cigna's proposed $54 billion deal to buy Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts is running into resistance from its highest profile investor.   Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn released an open letter urging his  fellow shareholders to vote against Cigna's deal to buy the pharmacy  benefits manager.  Cigna responded by saying that Mr. Icahn's view does not  represent those of Cigna's other shareholders.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs has been following the drama for us.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Carl Icahn called  Cigna's megadeal to acquire pharmacy benefits firm Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts a $60 billion folly.  The activist investor who has taken a stake  in Cigna is urging others to vote against the deal, arguing that the  insurers paying a 50 percent premium for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts at a  time when the pharmacy management business model is under siege from  regulators to the secretary of health and others who have been critical of  confidential rebate agreements which allow the PBMs to secure discounts  from drugmakers.  </p><p>Icahn also argues that Amazon's entrance into the pharmacy business  recently acquiring PillPack will also undermine the deal.  In his letter,  Icahn warns purchasing Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts would be one of the  worst blunders in corporate history, up there with the Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX)-AOL (NYSE:AOL) fiasco and General Electric (NYSE:GE) valued  destruction.  </p><p>Icahn believed Cigna would be better off building its own pharmacy unit and  returning cash to shareholders.  </p><p>But Leerink analyst Ana Gupta who raised Cigna an outperform called Icahn's  proposals unrealistic.  She argues it would be a challenge for Cigna to  build a pharmacy unit with enough scale and that integrating medical and  pharmacy benefits is what will help insurers and PBM defend against the  pushback on rebates and against new entrants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who  will only have one piece of the puzzle for now.  </p><p>In response to Icahn, a spokesman for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts said: We  believe that we are well-positioned for growth and remain confident in the  deal -- noting that they raised their guidance for client retention in the  recent earnings report.  Cigna declined to comment on the Icahn letter but  CEO David Cordani expressed confidence the deal would get done on last  week's earnings conference call.  </p><p>Icahn also suggested that the only Cigna shareholders who have reason to  support the deal are those who also own shares of Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts.  (INAUDIBLE) stocks fund is the largest stakeholder in both firms,  he's declined to comment on the letter.  The shareholder vote is scheduled  for August 24th.  Shareholder advisory services are likely to weigh in on  the vote later this week.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here is another look at the final numbers for Wall  Street.  The Dow was a big winner, climbing 126 points to 25,628.  The  Nasdaq rose 23.  The S&amp;P 500 gained 8.  </p><p>And that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for watching and  happy birthday.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Oh, thank you very much.  Yes, I'm measuring my age now in  Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH).  That would be 16.

Disney's  earnings and revenue come in below expectations even though strong growth  in several key areas were shown.  What now for the widely held Dow  component?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  U-turn.  Tesla's Elon Musk  says he's thinking of taking the automaker private and that sends investors  on a wild ride.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GRIFFETH:  And bad breadth?  The major indices are closing in on all-time  highs again, but is the rally broad enough to keep the bull running?  </p><p> All that and much more tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Tuesday, August the 7th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Already.  </p><p> Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Stocks rise and inch closer to all-time highs.  We'll have more on that in  just a bit.</p><p> But there was big news from a pair of big names today.  We'll start with  Disney (NYSE:DIS).  Earnings that were off the mark.  The company did come  in below earnings and revenue estimates, but it also had strong growth in  studio, parks and broadcast units.  </p><p> Here are the numbers.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) earned $1.87 cents a share.  That  is an 8-cent miss and revenue was a little light and still $18 billion for  the quarter.  Shares initially fell sharply and then rebounded.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin has the key takeaway for investors.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  fell short of analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, despite  seeing revenue growth at every division, but consumer products with its  studio division growing revenue by 20 percent on the strength of \"Avengers:  Infinity War\" and \"Incredibles 2\", two examples of the success of Disney's  acquisition, Marvel and Pixar.  </p><p> In the earnings release, CEO Bob Iger focusing on his confidence for  Disney's acquisition, Fox, saying, we're more enthusiastic about the Fox  acquisition than ever and confident in our ability to fully leverage these  assets.  </p><p> The cable networks are still a weak spot.  The segment operating income  dropping by 5 percent which is a bit worse than expected.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Let's turn to Bill Smead for more on all of this.  He is the CEO  of Smead Capital and a longtime shareholder of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and a big  proponent of a company even though there have been questions for the last  few years, Bill, about ESPN and the cable components which again showed  some weakness this time around.  </p><p> You sort of dismiss that as noise.  Why?  </p><p> BILL SMEAD, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, first of all, they're a  manager of a variety of brands and so what happens, just like when you run  a good stock portfolio, there are certain stocks you own that are doing  well temporarily and there are some that aren't doing as well, and you just  want to have a great majority doing well all the time and they've done  that, and remember, these -- this stock was under tremendous pressure  during this battle for these Fox assets and people were wondering if  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other futuristic competitors were going to put  them out of business or something.  </p><p> So it's, you know, they made 18 percent more than last year in a year  that's been one of trial and tribulation.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, is Wall Street's reaction in the after hours when we said it  dipped and then came back after Bob Iger did the conference call -- was  that an overreaction?  </p><p> SMEAD:  Well, we would -- possibly, but here's how we look at it.  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), you know, is a company that Warren Buffett said the biggest  regret in his career was he owned it a long time ago and he sold it.  So,  there's maybe 20 companies that literally are part of Americana and  literally own the hearts and minds of a vast majority of people in the  United States and around the world and this stock trades at a significant  discount to the other companies, the Nikes and the Starbuckses and those  kind of companies.  The Microsofts, right?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> SMEAD:  So, it trades at, say, a 25 percent discount to those all because  of the fears of streaming, over the top and the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) world  putting them out of business.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, I don't think they're going to put them out of business,  but clearly, Bob Iger has made it clear that over the top video streaming  is very important to the future of this company.  They are setting it up.   They're pricing it.  They're getting it ready to take on the likes of  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  </p><p> What do you think it will do for Disney (NYSE:DIS)?  </p><p> SMEAD:  Well, history tells us a little bit about this.  People thought the  VCR was going to mess them up.  People thought cable was going to mess them  up.  </p><p> Content is always king, and they have the best manufacturing process for  creating brands and content and then they're also very astute bargain  hunters for underperforming brands in content and that shouldn't change  much regardless of what the technology delivery system is.  </p><p> HERERA:  Are you -- are you, very quickly, Bill, are you happy with the way  they've tried to turn ESPN around?  I mean, Mr. Iger says there's more to  be done.  </p><p> SMEAD:  There is, but demographics play a big part in the slowdown in ESPN,  and that is I'm 60.  There are more 60-year-olds than there are 45-year- olds.  Forty-five-year-old men are the bread and butter, there are just as  many of them as there was 10 years ago.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> SMEAD:  That will pick up in another 10 years and no one will be worrying  about ESPN.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Sleep well, Bill Smead with Smead Capital Management.  Thanks  for joining us again tonight.  </p><p> SMEAD:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  The other big name making news today is Tesla.  CEO Elon Musk  created quite a stir with a series of tweets saying he's, quote,  considering taking Tesla private at $420.  Musk said no decision has been  made yet, but added the current investors could hold on to their positions  through a special fund or sell their shares at the $420 mark.  </p><p> By the way, this would be the biggest buyout in history.  Shares of Tesla  were already on the rise on the report that Saudi Arabia took a $2 billion  stake in the company, but then were halted following Musk's tweet.  They  eventually reopened, finishing up 11 percent.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Got that?  </p><p> And that better than 10 percent move in Tesla helped spur the Nasdaq to its  sixth straight day of gains.  Overall, stocks rose as investors stayed  focused on corporate earnings and the major indices just continue to inch  closer to all time highs.  The Dow today up 126 points to 25,628, the  Nasdaq added 24, the S&amp;P tacked on eight points today.  </p><p> HERERA:  As of the close today, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P are within 1 percent  of historic highs.  The Dow stands about 3.5 percent away, all capable of  breaking through on any given day.  </p><p> Bob Pisani takes us on a ride to the top.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The markets are  knocking on the door of historic highs once again.  The S&amp;P 500 is less  than 1 percent from the record high.  How does he get here?  </p><p> The market has been moving on a powerful combination of factors.  First,  the earnings story is still going strong for the second half of the year  and for the third and fourth quarter, the guidance is not dropped at all.   We're still looking at gains of more than 20 percent for the third and  fourth quarter.  Those are big numbers.  </p><p> Second, while a small group of companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) have fallen victim to these tariff issues, the vast  majority of companies continue to see very little impact from the trade  wars.  </p><p> Third, there's been a tidal wave of buybacks announced this year.  The  companies are flushed with cash and it's a record $750 billion of buyback  that's been announced so far.  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is expecting $1  trillion by the end of the year.  That's a jump of about 50 percent from  last year.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone has already bought back more than $40  billion in stock this year.  </p><p> There's also a market rotation under way.  Despite the narrow rally, the  market's not been entirely dominated by technology.  When tech falters,  traders buy other sectors.  So, recently, we've also seen defensive value- oriented sectors like healthcare and banks and especially consumer staples  that have been strong in the last month.  </p><p> Finally, the U.S. continues to show signs of strength in its economy.  The  GDP growth is looking to be well over 3 percent for the rest of 2018.  So,  the big question now is, what will it take to get the S&amp;P 500 over the  finish line?  We're really close.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And the question surrounding the market any time new highs are  that close: is there enough support to keep the rally going?  </p><p> Mike Santoli takes a look for us.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The major stock  indexes are poised to return to record highs lasting more than six months  ago, but one criticism of this rally remains popular, that the market is  too reliant on a small group of big tech stocks for its recent gain?  Is  this true?  Or is the climb broad enough to support further upside to new  record highs?  </p><p> There is some truth to the argument that the largest tech stocks such as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) have driven much of the market's gain.  Roughly half of the  increase of the S&amp;P 500 index has valued this year has come from those four  stocks alone, and the technology sector as a whole is up more than 16  percent compared to the S&amp;P 500's 7 percent rise, but it's not true that  those winners have obscured pervasive weakness below the surface.  </p><p> The majority of all stocks are up for the year, the equal weighted version  of the S&amp;P 500 in which each of the 500 stock has the same influence is up  nearly 5 percent for 2018.  More than twice as many large stocks are up 10  percent than have fallen that much.  And a Russell 2000 small companies  stock index has advanced some 10 percent.  </p><p> So, while investors have become somewhat more selective than in last year's  inclusive surge, with the strong preference for fast-growing technology  giant this year, it's not clear that the market is skewed toward a small  handful of winners at the expense of the majority of stocks.  The reason  investors do focus closely on the breakdown of market breadth is that major  market peaks are often preceded by an extreme narrowing of the market with  select big stocks holding up the indexes as the average stock suffers.  </p><p> With the bull market that began in 2009 set to become the longest on record  in the next few weeks, it makes sense to focus on these patterns.  So far,  at least, the rally seems just broad enough to fend off the bears.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So what will it take to get this market to the next level?  </p><p> Scott Kubie, chief investment officer at the Carson Group joins us now to  talk about that.</p><p> And I want to pick up on what mike kind of mentioned right at the end, and  that's the broadening out of the market because you also think that that's  important.  </p><p> SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CIO:  Yes.  We've seen really great leadership in  a small number of stocks, but I don't think that's going to get us to -- it  may get us to new highs, but it's not going to get us a really strong  return over the rest of the year and we think that we need a broader  participation especially from value stocks, which have really lagged growth  stocks by a wide margin this year.</p><p> I think one of the nice things is we saw that in July where value stocks  outperformed growth stocks by about a percent depending on the index you  use, and that's a very positive sign as we go into the second half of the  year.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Yes, assuming that we are in the late portion of the cycle here  for this market.  The value is the place where people often look and you're  telling us to look for this particular value ETF tonight, right?  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes, one of the ETFs that we really like is the iShares Core S&amp;P  500 Value ETF and the ticker is ISUV.  There are a number of great value  ETFs out there, but one of the reasons we like it is that value stocks with  cheap relative to growth on a valuation basis.  Bbut also some of the  sector allocations toward financials and energy look to us to be really  attractive in the late cycle stage and we think the sectors are going to  outperform in the second half of the year and into 2019.  </p><p> HERERA:  You also are dabbling in the energy sector National Oilwell, the  ticker symbol is NOV.  You would also be looking at that.  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes.  That's an interesting story.  The National Oilwell Varco is a  supplier to a lot of the oil rig manufacturers.  And so, as we've seen a  strong, sustained rally in oil, it's caused manufacturers to go out and to  build more wells and hopefully order more equipment.  And as the supplier  to them, that late cycle stage is really very positive for them.  </p><p> They also supply a lot to offshore drillers and that's become much more  competitive and we've seen the overall shale production run into some  troubles in allowing oil prices to stay long for a long time.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> KUBIE:  That's a big help for the offshore drillers.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Quickly, Scott, I want to get this one in because you talk about  the financials and if we are in a late cycle, usually inflation will start  to pick up.  So, you're looking at a TIPX SPDR here, as well, right?  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes.  I think this has had great risk reduction characteristics for  two risks that faced the market.  First, if the economy continues to stay  strong and employment continues to stay strong, we have the risk of  inflation picking up quite a bit, and so having some inflation protection  makes a lot of sense.  The other, though, is if we have these tariffs go  through and that ultimately raises consumer prices, we may be in a  situation where great interest rates may stay about the same, inflation may  rise quite a bit, and the overall real rates would fall.  </p><p> That would be especially positive for TIPX and that's one of the reasons  why we like them --  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.</p><p> KUBIE:  -- as a low-risk portion in your portfolio.  </p><p> HERERA:  Scott, thank you very much.  Scott Kubie is with the Carson Group.  </p><p> Bill?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, job openings in the U.S. hovered near record highs in  June.  Job openings are a measure, of course, labor demand and they were  unchanged in June at 6.7 million.  The all-time high was the 6.8 million in  April.  The downside, the hiring rate slipped slightly.  </p><p> HERERA:  Last week's employment report showed 157,000 jobs created in July  and you can tack those on to the millions that have been created over the  past decade, under two presidents, one a Democrat, the other a Republican,  and both take credit for the number of jobs created.  But exactly who or  what is actually responsible?  </p><p> Steve Liesman takes a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  How much do  presidents have to do with job creation?  </p><p> A look at the differences between President Obama and Trump shows sometimes  a lot and sometimes not much at all.  Under President Trump, 3.8 million  jobs have been created or 190,000 per month, counting the 20 months  starting after Trump's election November 2016.  </p><p> So in the prior 20 months of the Obama administration, that is from April  2015 to November 2016, 4.3 million jobs were created or a stronger 215,000  a month.  So, strong job growth continued under Trump that began under  Obama, and Trump has done well to keep it going, defying expectation of  economists that it would slow because of a lack of workers. </p><p> Four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs have been added under Trump  compared to just 21,000 for the 20 months under Obama.  That's a sign the  president's focus on manufacturing might be bearing some fruit, but it's  also mining and logging jobs which have grown by nearly 90,000 under Trump,  but fell by almost 200,000 under Obama.  This could be the result of policy  to deregulate the industry, but just as easily economists say the result of  higher oil prices, spurring U.S. production now versus oil prices that  reduced production under Obama.  </p><p> And there are some places where the trend under Obama simply continued  under Trump.  The transportation jobs remain as strong as they were, along  with professional and business services, along with education and health  care.  </p><p> Some job growth however has nothing to do with presidents.  More government  jobs were created under Obama than Trump.  But the biggest part of that  difference, local and state hiring over which presidents have little  control.  </p><p> So, there are definitely positive trends in the job market, all of which  most presidents will entirely take credit for, and they will be as they've  always been, just partially right.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p> We begin with Argus, cutting its rating on CBS (NYSE:CBS) from buy to hold.   The analysts noting significant risk to those sexual allegations against  CEO Les Moonves, including his possible termination.  In fact, the  possibility that if Moonves were to be fired, the board may drop its fight  with the Redstone family to merge CBS (NYSE:CBS) with Viacom (NYSE:VIA) and  Argus believes if they were to merge, it would be a negative for  shareholders.  Shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) closed at $53.22, up a fraction  today.  </p><p> SeaWorld was upgraded at Macquarie from underweight to hold following the  company's strong earnings report.  Macquarie says that SeaWorld's  management is executing well and attendance growth in the first half of the  year was impressive.  The price target was raised from $10 to $26 and  today's SeaWorld shares closed at $25.58, up nearly 4 percent.  </p><p> HERERA:  Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was cut at Argus from buy to hold on  concerns about gaming revenue growth in Macao.  Argus also lowered its  earnings outlook on Wynn for both this year and next, when shares climbed  just a fraction to $153.29.  </p><p> And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Zillow  from buy to neutral, citing concerns over the business model shift  following the company's purchase of mortgage lenders of America.  The  analysts say that could hurt Zillow's profits in fiscal 2019.  The price  target was also lower to $60 to $70.  Today, Zillow closed at $49.40, down  16 percent.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Coming up, trying to contain what has become California's  largest wildfire ever.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Firefighters in California continue to battle what has turned into  that state's largest fire in its history.  Eight major blazes are ravaging  California's landscape and have caused seven deaths and thousands of  evacuations.  </p><p> Aditi Roy joins us tonight from Ukiah, California.  </p><p> Good evening, Aditi.</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening to you,  Sue.</p><p> That's right, we are at the staging area for the Mendocino Complex Fire.   It is, as you mentioned, the largest wildfire in California history, nearly  the size of the city of Los Angeles and it is growing at unprecedented  rate.  Of the fire, it's actually comprised of two fires, the River Fire  and the Ranch Fire.  </p><p> The Ranch Fire is the bigger of the two.  It is more than 240,000 acres and  just more than 20 percent contained.  Eleven thousand three hundred  structures are threatened, 75 homes and businesses destroyed and 13,000  people have been ordered to evacuate.  An additional 8,000 have been  advised to do so.  </p><p> Fire officials tell us the weather conditions combined with the remote  location of the flames make it an especially tough fire fight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE KAUFMANN, CAL FIRE SPOKESMAN:  It's been a challenge for us to get  our crews in there because it's in a mountain range and a ridge top, and  so, we're still currently trying to get good, active containment line in  those areas.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROY:  There's nearly 4,000 firefighters here on scene and they have dumped  more than 100 million gallons of fire retardant, Sue, a massive show of  manpower and resources.  </p><p> HERERA:  Indeed.  Thank you so much, Aditi.  Aditi Roy tonight.  </p><p> Bill?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Profits disappointed at Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA),  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The entertainment giant said restructuring costs tied to its recent  acquisition of Scripts Network caused it to decline at a faster than  expected clip, revenue was a beat, though, helped by higher sales in the  company's international networks.  Shares closed down 5 percent to $25.55.  </p><p> Dairy producer Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) reported a loss but did see sales inch  ahead of expectations.  The company also slashed its earnings outlook for  the whole year citing inflationary pressures and growing competition from  private labels.  Shares plunged by 15 percent today to $8.04.  </p><p> HERERA:  More bad news from Papa John's.  After the closing bell, the pizza  chain said same-store sales declined across its U.S. stores causing  earnings to come up short.  Papa John's sees more pain ahead.  It cut its  outlook for the full year.  </p><p> The company's founder recently stepped down from his chairman role after he  apologized for using a racial slur during a conference call.  Shares fell  in the after-hours and also finished the regular down nearly 3 percent to  $41.07.  </p><p> And after the bell, Snap reported a decline on the number of active daily  users on its platform.  Despite using estimates for user growth, the social  media company beat earnings expectations which it said were helped by  strong performance in its ad business.  Also, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin  Talal said that he has bought a more than 2 percent stake in the company.   Shares initially jumped in the extended session but then fell back.  They  ended the regular day up half a percent to $13.12.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, things were slowly getting become to normal today after  Beijing's financial district was locked down amid protests.  The catalyst  was a meltdown in China's peer to peer lending market.  </p><p> Eunice Yoon is in Beijing to shed some light on this growing crisis there.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was business as  usual in Beijing's financial district today after yesterday's police  crackdown on protesters.  Organizers say thousands of people gathered  outside the banking regulator's office.  Hundreds of police stopped the  demonstration.  </p><p> The protesters were angry about money they lost in a peer to peer lending  industry.  Here in China it's still very difficult for ordinary people to  get loans from mainstream banks, so this whole industry of peer to peer  lending has emerged where investors who have money to lend are connected to  people who need capital to start businesses or just to buy something.  This  industry has grown quickly over the past few years, thanks to the high  returns, about 8 percent to 12 percent compared to less than 3 percent at  most traditional banks.</p><p> But because of title regulatory conditions and a liquidity crunch, some of  the lenders have started to fail.  In China, public protesters aren't  common, but it is common for investors who lose money to expect the  government to bail them out and that is what the protesters were seeking  yesterday.  </p><p> The troubles for the P2P are far from over.  There are concerns that the  P2P problems can spread to business in other sectors.  In the past week,  two companies, one router manufacturer and one convenience store chain  reported financials associated with P2P investments.  That would pose a  headache for Beijing which is struggling have a rising debt and the risk  associated with it.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, a $54 billion merger faces resistance from within.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Cigna's proposed $54 billion deal to buy Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts is running into resistance from its highest profile investor.   Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn released an open letter urging his  fellow shareholders to vote against Cigna's deal to buy the pharmacy  benefits manager.  Cigna responded by saying that Mr. Icahn's view does not  represent those of Cigna's other shareholders.  </p><p> Bertha Coombs has been following the drama for us.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Carl Icahn called  Cigna's megadeal to acquire pharmacy benefits firm Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts a $60 billion folly.  The activist investor who has taken a stake  in Cigna is urging others to vote against the deal, arguing that the  insurers paying a 50 percent premium for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts at a  time when the pharmacy management business model is under siege from  regulators to the secretary of health and others who have been critical of  confidential rebate agreements which allow the PBMs to secure discounts  from drugmakers.  </p><p> Icahn also argues that Amazon's entrance into the pharmacy business  recently acquiring PillPack will also undermine the deal.  In his letter,  Icahn warns purchasing Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts would be one of the  worst blunders in corporate history, up there with the Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX)-AOL (NYSE:AOL) fiasco and General Electric (NYSE:GE) valued  destruction.  </p><p> Icahn believed Cigna would be better off building its own pharmacy unit and  returning cash to shareholders.  </p><p> But Leerink analyst Ana Gupta who raised Cigna an outperform called Icahn's  proposals unrealistic.  She argues it would be a challenge for Cigna to  build a pharmacy unit with enough scale and that integrating medical and  pharmacy benefits is what will help insurers and PBM defend against the  pushback on rebates and against new entrants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who  will only have one piece of the puzzle for now.  </p><p> In response to Icahn, a spokesman for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts said: We  believe that we are well-positioned for growth and remain confident in the  deal -- noting that they raised their guidance for client retention in the  recent earnings report.  Cigna declined to comment on the Icahn letter but  CEO David Cordani expressed confidence the deal would get done on last  week's earnings conference call.  </p><p> Icahn also suggested that the only Cigna shareholders who have reason to  support the deal are those who also own shares of Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts.  (INAUDIBLE) stocks fund is the largest stakeholder in both firms,  he's declined to comment on the letter.  The shareholder vote is scheduled  for August 24th.  Shareholder advisory services are likely to weigh in on  the vote later this week.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Before we go, here is another look at the final numbers for Wall  Street.  The Dow was a big winner, climbing 126 points to 25,628.  The  Nasdaq rose 23.  The S&amp;P 500 gained 8.  </p><p> And that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for watching and  happy birthday.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Oh, thank you very much.  Yes, I'm measuring my age now in  Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH).  That would be 16.

Disney's  earnings and revenue come in below expectations even though strong growth  in several key areas were shown.  What now for the widely held Dow  component?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  U-turn.  Tesla's Elon Musk  says he's thinking of taking the automaker private and that sends investors  on a wild ride.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GRIFFETH:  And bad breadth?  The major indices are closing in on all-time  highs again, but is the rally broad enough to keep the bull running?  </p><p> All that and much more tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Tuesday, August the 7th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Already.  </p><p> Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Stocks rise and inch closer to all-time highs.  We'll have more on that in  just a bit.</p><p> But there was big news from a pair of big names today.  We'll start with  Disney (NYSE:DIS).  Earnings that were off the mark.  The company did come  in below earnings and revenue estimates, but it also had strong growth in  studio, parks and broadcast units.  </p><p> Here are the numbers.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) earned $1.87 cents a share.  That  is an 8-cent miss and revenue was a little light and still $18 billion for  the quarter.  Shares initially fell sharply and then rebounded.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin has the key takeaway for investors.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  fell short of analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, despite  seeing revenue growth at every division, but consumer products with its  studio division growing revenue by 20 percent on the strength of \"Avengers:  Infinity War\" and \"Incredibles 2\", two examples of the success of Disney's  acquisition, Marvel and Pixar.  </p><p> In the earnings release, CEO Bob Iger focusing on his confidence for  Disney's acquisition, Fox, saying, we're more enthusiastic about the Fox  acquisition than ever and confident in our ability to fully leverage these  assets.  </p><p> The cable networks are still a weak spot.  The segment operating income  dropping by 5 percent which is a bit worse than expected.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Let's turn to Bill Smead for more on all of this.  He is the CEO  of Smead Capital and a longtime shareholder of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and a big  proponent of a company even though there have been questions for the last  few years, Bill, about ESPN and the cable components which again showed  some weakness this time around.  </p><p> You sort of dismiss that as noise.  Why?  </p><p> BILL SMEAD, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, first of all, they're a  manager of a variety of brands and so what happens, just like when you run  a good stock portfolio, there are certain stocks you own that are doing  well temporarily and there are some that aren't doing as well, and you just  want to have a great majority doing well all the time and they've done  that, and remember, these -- this stock was under tremendous pressure  during this battle for these Fox assets and people were wondering if  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other futuristic competitors were going to put  them out of business or something.  </p><p> So it's, you know, they made 18 percent more than last year in a year  that's been one of trial and tribulation.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, is Wall Street's reaction in the after hours when we said it  dipped and then came back after Bob Iger did the conference call -- was  that an overreaction?  </p><p> SMEAD:  Well, we would -- possibly, but here's how we look at it.  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), you know, is a company that Warren Buffett said the biggest  regret in his career was he owned it a long time ago and he sold it.  So,  there's maybe 20 companies that literally are part of Americana and  literally own the hearts and minds of a vast majority of people in the  United States and around the world and this stock trades at a significant  discount to the other companies, the Nikes and the Starbuckses and those  kind of companies.  The Microsofts, right?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> SMEAD:  So, it trades at, say, a 25 percent discount to those all because  of the fears of streaming, over the top and the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) world  putting them out of business.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, I don't think they're going to put them out of business,  but clearly, Bob Iger has made it clear that over the top video streaming  is very important to the future of this company.  They are setting it up.   They're pricing it.  They're getting it ready to take on the likes of  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  </p><p> What do you think it will do for Disney (NYSE:DIS)?  </p><p> SMEAD:  Well, history tells us a little bit about this.  People thought the  VCR was going to mess them up.  People thought cable was going to mess them  up.  </p><p> Content is always king, and they have the best manufacturing process for  creating brands and content and then they're also very astute bargain  hunters for underperforming brands in content and that shouldn't change  much regardless of what the technology delivery system is.  </p><p> HERERA:  Are you -- are you, very quickly, Bill, are you happy with the way  they've tried to turn ESPN around?  I mean, Mr. Iger says there's more to  be done.  </p><p> SMEAD:  There is, but demographics play a big part in the slowdown in ESPN,  and that is I'm 60.  There are more 60-year-olds than there are 45-year- olds.  Forty-five-year-old men are the bread and butter, there are just as  many of them as there was 10 years ago.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> SMEAD:  That will pick up in another 10 years and no one will be worrying  about ESPN.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Sleep well, Bill Smead with Smead Capital Management.  Thanks  for joining us again tonight.  </p><p> SMEAD:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  The other big name making news today is Tesla.  CEO Elon Musk  created quite a stir with a series of tweets saying he's, quote,  considering taking Tesla private at $420.  Musk said no decision has been  made yet, but added the current investors could hold on to their positions  through a special fund or sell their shares at the $420 mark.  </p><p> By the way, this would be the biggest buyout in history.  Shares of Tesla  were already on the rise on the report that Saudi Arabia took a $2 billion  stake in the company, but then were halted following Musk's tweet.  They  eventually reopened, finishing up 11 percent.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Got that?  </p><p> And that better than 10 percent move in Tesla helped spur the Nasdaq to its  sixth straight day of gains.  Overall, stocks rose as investors stayed  focused on corporate earnings and the major indices just continue to inch  closer to all time highs.  The Dow today up 126 points to 25,628, the  Nasdaq added 24, the S&amp;P tacked on eight points today.  </p><p> HERERA:  As of the close today, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P are within 1 percent  of historic highs.  The Dow stands about 3.5 percent away, all capable of  breaking through on any given day.  </p><p> Bob Pisani takes us on a ride to the top.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The markets are  knocking on the door of historic highs once again.  The S&amp;P 500 is less  than 1 percent from the record high.  How does he get here?  </p><p> The market has been moving on a powerful combination of factors.  First,  the earnings story is still going strong for the second half of the year  and for the third and fourth quarter, the guidance is not dropped at all.   We're still looking at gains of more than 20 percent for the third and  fourth quarter.  Those are big numbers.  </p><p> Second, while a small group of companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) have fallen victim to these tariff issues, the vast  majority of companies continue to see very little impact from the trade  wars.  </p><p> Third, there's been a tidal wave of buybacks announced this year.  The  companies are flushed with cash and it's a record $750 billion of buyback  that's been announced so far.  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is expecting $1  trillion by the end of the year.  That's a jump of about 50 percent from  last year.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone has already bought back more than $40  billion in stock this year.  </p><p> There's also a market rotation under way.  Despite the narrow rally, the  market's not been entirely dominated by technology.  When tech falters,  traders buy other sectors.  So, recently, we've also seen defensive value- oriented sectors like healthcare and banks and especially consumer staples  that have been strong in the last month.  </p><p> Finally, the U.S. continues to show signs of strength in its economy.  The  GDP growth is looking to be well over 3 percent for the rest of 2018.  So,  the big question now is, what will it take to get the S&amp;P 500 over the  finish line?  We're really close.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And the question surrounding the market any time new highs are  that close: is there enough support to keep the rally going?  </p><p> Mike Santoli takes a look for us.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The major stock  indexes are poised to return to record highs lasting more than six months  ago, but one criticism of this rally remains popular, that the market is  too reliant on a small group of big tech stocks for its recent gain?  Is  this true?  Or is the climb broad enough to support further upside to new  record highs?  </p><p> There is some truth to the argument that the largest tech stocks such as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) have driven much of the market's gain.  Roughly half of the  increase of the S&amp;P 500 index has valued this year has come from those four  stocks alone, and the technology sector as a whole is up more than 16  percent compared to the S&amp;P 500's 7 percent rise, but it's not true that  those winners have obscured pervasive weakness below the surface.  </p><p> The majority of all stocks are up for the year, the equal weighted version  of the S&amp;P 500 in which each of the 500 stock has the same influence is up  nearly 5 percent for 2018.  More than twice as many large stocks are up 10  percent than have fallen that much.  And a Russell 2000 small companies  stock index has advanced some 10 percent.  </p><p> So, while investors have become somewhat more selective than in last year's  inclusive surge, with the strong preference for fast-growing technology  giant this year, it's not clear that the market is skewed toward a small  handful of winners at the expense of the majority of stocks.  The reason  investors do focus closely on the breakdown of market breadth is that major  market peaks are often preceded by an extreme narrowing of the market with  select big stocks holding up the indexes as the average stock suffers.  </p><p> With the bull market that began in 2009 set to become the longest on record  in the next few weeks, it makes sense to focus on these patterns.  So far,  at least, the rally seems just broad enough to fend off the bears.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So what will it take to get this market to the next level?  </p><p> Scott Kubie, chief investment officer at the Carson Group joins us now to  talk about that.</p><p> And I want to pick up on what mike kind of mentioned right at the end, and  that's the broadening out of the market because you also think that that's  important.  </p><p> SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CIO:  Yes.  We've seen really great leadership in  a small number of stocks, but I don't think that's going to get us to -- it  may get us to new highs, but it's not going to get us a really strong  return over the rest of the year and we think that we need a broader  participation especially from value stocks, which have really lagged growth  stocks by a wide margin this year.</p><p> I think one of the nice things is we saw that in July where value stocks  outperformed growth stocks by about a percent depending on the index you  use, and that's a very positive sign as we go into the second half of the  year.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Yes, assuming that we are in the late portion of the cycle here  for this market.  The value is the place where people often look and you're  telling us to look for this particular value ETF tonight, right?  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes, one of the ETFs that we really like is the iShares Core S&amp;P  500 Value ETF and the ticker is ISUV.  There are a number of great value  ETFs out there, but one of the reasons we like it is that value stocks with  cheap relative to growth on a valuation basis.  Bbut also some of the  sector allocations toward financials and energy look to us to be really  attractive in the late cycle stage and we think the sectors are going to  outperform in the second half of the year and into 2019.  </p><p> HERERA:  You also are dabbling in the energy sector National Oilwell, the  ticker symbol is NOV.  You would also be looking at that.  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes.  That's an interesting story.  The National Oilwell Varco is a  supplier to a lot of the oil rig manufacturers.  And so, as we've seen a  strong, sustained rally in oil, it's caused manufacturers to go out and to  build more wells and hopefully order more equipment.  And as the supplier  to them, that late cycle stage is really very positive for them.  </p><p> They also supply a lot to offshore drillers and that's become much more  competitive and we've seen the overall shale production run into some  troubles in allowing oil prices to stay long for a long time.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> KUBIE:  That's a big help for the offshore drillers.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Quickly, Scott, I want to get this one in because you talk about  the financials and if we are in a late cycle, usually inflation will start  to pick up.  So, you're looking at a TIPX SPDR here, as well, right?  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes.  I think this has had great risk reduction characteristics for  two risks that faced the market.  First, if the economy continues to stay  strong and employment continues to stay strong, we have the risk of  inflation picking up quite a bit, and so having some inflation protection  makes a lot of sense.  The other, though, is if we have these tariffs go  through and that ultimately raises consumer prices, we may be in a  situation where great interest rates may stay about the same, inflation may  rise quite a bit, and the overall real rates would fall.  </p><p> That would be especially positive for TIPX and that's one of the reasons  why we like them --  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.</p><p> KUBIE:  -- as a low-risk portion in your portfolio.  </p><p> HERERA:  Scott, thank you very much.  Scott Kubie is with the Carson Group.  </p><p> Bill?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, job openings in the U.S. hovered near record highs in  June.  Job openings are a measure, of course, labor demand and they were  unchanged in June at 6.7 million.  The all-time high was the 6.8 million in  April.  The downside, the hiring rate slipped slightly.  </p><p> HERERA:  Last week's employment report showed 157,000 jobs created in July  and you can tack those on to the millions that have been created over the  past decade, under two presidents, one a Democrat, the other a Republican,  and both take credit for the number of jobs created.  But exactly who or  what is actually responsible?  </p><p> Steve Liesman takes a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  How much do  presidents have to do with job creation?  </p><p> A look at the differences between President Obama and Trump shows sometimes  a lot and sometimes not much at all.  Under President Trump, 3.8 million  jobs have been created or 190,000 per month, counting the 20 months  starting after Trump's election November 2016.  </p><p> So in the prior 20 months of the Obama administration, that is from April  2015 to November 2016, 4.3 million jobs were created or a stronger 215,000  a month.  So, strong job growth continued under Trump that began under  Obama, and Trump has done well to keep it going, defying expectation of  economists that it would slow because of a lack of workers. </p><p> Four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs have been added under Trump  compared to just 21,000 for the 20 months under Obama.  That's a sign the  president's focus on manufacturing might be bearing some fruit, but it's  also mining and logging jobs which have grown by nearly 90,000 under Trump,  but fell by almost 200,000 under Obama.  This could be the result of policy  to deregulate the industry, but just as easily economists say the result of  higher oil prices, spurring U.S. production now versus oil prices that  reduced production under Obama.  </p><p> And there are some places where the trend under Obama simply continued  under Trump.  The transportation jobs remain as strong as they were, along  with professional and business services, along with education and health  care.  </p><p> Some job growth however has nothing to do with presidents.  More government  jobs were created under Obama than Trump.  But the biggest part of that  difference, local and state hiring over which presidents have little  control.  </p><p> So, there are definitely positive trends in the job market, all of which  most presidents will entirely take credit for, and they will be as they've  always been, just partially right.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p> We begin with Argus, cutting its rating on CBS (NYSE:CBS) from buy to hold.   The analysts noting significant risk to those sexual allegations against  CEO Les Moonves, including his possible termination.  In fact, the  possibility that if Moonves were to be fired, the board may drop its fight  with the Redstone family to merge CBS (NYSE:CBS) with Viacom (NYSE:VIA) and  Argus believes if they were to merge, it would be a negative for  shareholders.  Shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) closed at $53.22, up a fraction  today.  </p><p> SeaWorld was upgraded at Macquarie from underweight to hold following the  company's strong earnings report.

Eight major blazes are ravaging  California's landscape and have caused seven deaths and thousands of  evacuations.  </p><p> Aditi Roy joins us tonight from Ukiah, California.  </p><p> Good evening, Aditi.</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening to you,  Sue.</p><p> That's right, we are at the staging area for the Mendocino Complex Fire.   It is, as you mentioned, the largest wildfire in California history, nearly  the size of the city of Los Angeles and it is growing at unprecedented  rate.  Of the fire, it's actually comprised of two fires, the River Fire  and the Ranch Fire.  </p><p> The Ranch Fire is the bigger of the two.  It is more than 240,000 acres and  just more than 20 percent contained.  Eleven thousand three hundred  structures are threatened, 75 homes and businesses destroyed and 13,000  people have been ordered to evacuate.  An additional 8,000 have been  advised to do so.  </p><p> Fire officials tell us the weather conditions combined with the remote  location of the flames make it an especially tough fire fight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE KAUFMANN, CAL FIRE SPOKESMAN:  It's been a challenge for us to get  our crews in there because it's in a mountain range and a ridge top, and  so, we're still currently trying to get good, active containment line in  those areas.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROY:  There's nearly 4,000 firefighters here on scene and they have dumped  more than 100 million gallons of fire retardant, Sue, a massive show of  manpower and resources.  </p><p> HERERA:  Indeed.  Thank you so much, Aditi.  Aditi Roy tonight.  </p><p> Bill?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Profits disappointed at Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA),  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The entertainment giant said restructuring costs tied to its recent  acquisition of Scripts Network caused it to decline at a faster than  expected clip, revenue was a beat, though, helped by higher sales in the  company's international networks.  Shares closed down 5 percent to $25.55.  </p><p> Dairy producer Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) reported a loss but did see sales inch  ahead of expectations.  The company also slashed its earnings outlook for  the whole year citing inflationary pressures and growing competition from  private labels.  Shares plunged by 15 percent today to $8.04.  </p><p> HERERA:  More bad news from Papa John's.  After the closing bell, the pizza  chain said same-store sales declined across its U.S. stores causing  earnings to come up short.  Papa John's sees more pain ahead.  It cut its  outlook for the full year.  </p><p> The company's founder recently stepped down from his chairman role after he  apologized for using a racial slur during a conference call.  Shares fell  in the after-hours and also finished the regular down nearly 3 percent to  $41.07.  </p><p> And after the bell, Snap reported a decline on the number of active daily  users on its platform.  Despite using estimates for user growth, the social  media company beat earnings expectations which it said were helped by  strong performance in its ad business.  Also, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin  Talal said that he has bought a more than 2 percent stake in the company.   Shares initially jumped in the extended session but then fell back.  They  ended the regular day up half a percent to $13.12.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, things were slowly getting become to normal today after  Beijing's financial district was locked down amid protests.  The catalyst  was a meltdown in China's peer to peer lending market.  </p><p> Eunice Yoon is in Beijing to shed some light on this growing crisis there.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was business as  usual in Beijing's financial district today after yesterday's police  crackdown on protesters.  Organizers say thousands of people gathered  outside the banking regulator's office.  Hundreds of police stopped the  demonstration.  </p><p> The protesters were angry about money they lost in a peer to peer lending  industry.  Here in China it's still very difficult for ordinary people to  get loans from mainstream banks, so this whole industry of peer to peer  lending has emerged where investors who have money to lend are connected to  people who need capital to start businesses or just to buy something.  This  industry has grown quickly over the past few years, thanks to the high  returns, about 8 percent to 12 percent compared to less than 3 percent at  most traditional banks.</p><p> But because of title regulatory conditions and a liquidity crunch, some of  the lenders have started to fail.  In China, public protesters aren't  common, but it is common for investors who lose money to expect the  government to bail them out and that is what the protesters were seeking  yesterday.  </p><p> The troubles for the P2P are far from over.  There are concerns that the  P2P problems can spread to business in other sectors.  In the past week,  two companies, one router manufacturer and one convenience store chain  reported financials associated with P2P investments.  That would pose a  headache for Beijing which is struggling have a rising debt and the risk  associated with it.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, a $54 billion merger faces resistance from within.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Cigna's proposed $54 billion deal to buy Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts is running into resistance from its highest profile investor.   Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn released an open letter urging his  fellow shareholders to vote against Cigna's deal to buy the pharmacy  benefits manager.  Cigna responded by saying that Mr. Icahn's view does not  represent those of Cigna's other shareholders.  </p><p> Bertha Coombs has been following the drama for us.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Carl Icahn called  Cigna's megadeal to acquire pharmacy benefits firm Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts a $60 billion folly.  The activist investor who has taken a stake  in Cigna is urging others to vote against the deal, arguing that the  insurers paying a 50 percent premium for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts at a  time when the pharmacy management business model is under siege from  regulators to the secretary of health and others who have been critical of  confidential rebate agreements which allow the PBMs to secure discounts  from drugmakers.  </p><p> Icahn also argues that Amazon's entrance into the pharmacy business  recently acquiring PillPack will also undermine the deal.  In his letter,  Icahn warns purchasing Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts would be one of the  worst blunders in corporate history, up there with the Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX)-AOL (NYSE:AOL) fiasco and General Electric (NYSE:GE) valued  destruction.  </p><p> Icahn believed Cigna would be better off building its own pharmacy unit and  returning cash to shareholders.  </p><p> But Leerink analyst Ana Gupta who raised Cigna an outperform called Icahn's  proposals unrealistic.  She argues it would be a challenge for Cigna to  build a pharmacy unit with enough scale and that integrating medical and  pharmacy benefits is what will help insurers and PBM defend against the  pushback on rebates and against new entrants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who  will only have one piece of the puzzle for now.  </p><p> In response to Icahn, a spokesman for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts said: We  believe that we are well-positioned for growth and remain confident in the  deal -- noting that they raised their guidance for client retention in the  recent earnings report.  Cigna declined to comment on the Icahn letter but  CEO David Cordani expressed confidence the deal would get done on last  week's earnings conference call.  </p><p> Icahn also suggested that the only Cigna shareholders who have reason to  support the deal are those who also own shares of Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts.  (INAUDIBLE) stocks fund is the largest stakeholder in both firms,  he's declined to comment on the letter.  The shareholder vote is scheduled  for August 24th.  Shareholder advisory services are likely to weigh in on  the vote later this week.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Before we go, here is another look at the final numbers for Wall  Street.  The Dow was a big winner, climbing 126 points to 25,628.  The  Nasdaq rose 23.  The S&amp;P 500 gained 8.  </p><p> And that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for watching and  happy birthday.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Oh, thank you very much.  Yes, I'm measuring my age now in  Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH).  That would be 16.  Happy sweet 16.  </p><p> I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

Disney's  earnings and revenue come in below expectations even though strong growth  in several key areas were shown.  What now for the widely held Dow  component?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  U-turn.  Tesla's Elon Musk  says he's thinking of taking the automaker private and that sends investors  on a wild ride.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  And bad breadth?  The major indices are closing in on all-time  highs again, but is the rally broad enough to keep the bull running?  </p><p>All that and much more tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Tuesday, August the 7th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Already.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Stocks rise and inch closer to all-time highs.  We'll have more on that in  just a bit.</p><p>But there was big news from a pair of big names today.  We'll start with  Disney (NYSE:DIS).  Earnings that were off the mark.  The company did come  in below earnings and revenue estimates, but it also had strong growth in  studio, parks and broadcast units.  </p><p>Here are the numbers.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) earned $1.87 cents a share.  That  is an 8-cent miss and revenue was a little light and still $18 billion for  the quarter.  Shares initially fell sharply and then rebounded.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has the key takeaway for investors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  fell short of analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, despite  seeing revenue growth at every division, but consumer products with its  studio division growing revenue by 20 percent on the strength of \"Avengers:  Infinity War\" and \"Incredibles 2\", two examples of the success of Disney's  acquisition, Marvel and Pixar.  </p><p>In the earnings release, CEO Bob Iger focusing on his confidence for  Disney's acquisition, Fox, saying, we're more enthusiastic about the Fox  acquisition than ever and confident in our ability to fully leverage these  assets.  </p><p>The cable networks are still a weak spot.  The segment operating income  dropping by 5 percent which is a bit worse than expected.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let's turn to Bill Smead for more on all of this.  He is the CEO  of Smead Capital and a longtime shareholder of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and a big  proponent of a company even though there have been questions for the last  few years, Bill, about ESPN and the cable components which again showed  some weakness this time around.  </p><p>You sort of dismiss that as noise.  Why?  </p><p>BILL SMEAD, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, first of all, they're a  manager of a variety of brands and so what happens, just like when you run  a good stock portfolio, there are certain stocks you own that are doing  well temporarily and there are some that aren't doing as well, and you just  want to have a great majority doing well all the time and they've done  that, and remember, these -- this stock was under tremendous pressure  during this battle for these Fox assets and people were wondering if  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other futuristic competitors were going to put  them out of business or something.  </p><p>So it's, you know, they made 18 percent more than last year in a year  that's been one of trial and tribulation.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, is Wall Street's reaction in the after hours when we said it  dipped and then came back after Bob Iger did the conference call -- was  that an overreaction?  </p><p>SMEAD:  Well, we would -- possibly, but here's how we look at it.  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), you know, is a company that Warren Buffett said the biggest  regret in his career was he owned it a long time ago and he sold it.  So,  there's maybe 20 companies that literally are part of Americana and  literally own the hearts and minds of a vast majority of people in the  United States and around the world and this stock trades at a significant  discount to the other companies, the Nikes and the Starbuckses and those  kind of companies.  The Microsofts, right?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SMEAD:  So, it trades at, say, a 25 percent discount to those all because  of the fears of streaming, over the top and the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) world  putting them out of business.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, I don't think they're going to put them out of business,  but clearly, Bob Iger has made it clear that over the top video streaming  is very important to the future of this company.  They are setting it up.   They're pricing it.  They're getting it ready to take on the likes of  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  </p><p>What do you think it will do for Disney (NYSE:DIS)?  </p><p>SMEAD:  Well, history tells us a little bit about this.  People thought the  VCR was going to mess them up.  People thought cable was going to mess them  up.  </p><p>Content is always king, and they have the best manufacturing process for  creating brands and content and then they're also very astute bargain  hunters for underperforming brands in content and that shouldn't change  much regardless of what the technology delivery system is.  </p><p>HERERA:  Are you -- are you, very quickly, Bill, are you happy with the way  they've tried to turn ESPN around?  I mean, Mr. Iger says there's more to  be done.  </p><p>SMEAD:  There is, but demographics play a big part in the slowdown in ESPN,  and that is I'm 60.  There are more 60-year-olds than there are 45-year- olds.  Forty-five-year-old men are the bread and butter, there are just as  many of them as there was 10 years ago.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SMEAD:  That will pick up in another 10 years and no one will be worrying  about ESPN.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Sleep well, Bill Smead with Smead Capital Management.  Thanks  for joining us again tonight.  </p><p>SMEAD:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  The other big name making news today is Tesla.  CEO Elon Musk  created quite a stir with a series of tweets saying he's, quote,  considering taking Tesla private at $420.  Musk said no decision has been  made yet, but added the current investors could hold on to their positions  through a special fund or sell their shares at the $420 mark.  </p><p>By the way, this would be the biggest buyout in history.  Shares of Tesla  were already on the rise on the report that Saudi Arabia took a $2 billion  stake in the company, but then were halted following Musk's tweet.  They  eventually reopened, finishing up 11 percent.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Got that?  </p><p>And that better than 10 percent move in Tesla helped spur the Nasdaq to its  sixth straight day of gains.  Overall, stocks rose as investors stayed  focused on corporate earnings and the major indices just continue to inch  closer to all time highs.  The Dow today up 126 points to 25,628, the  Nasdaq added 24, the S&amp;P tacked on eight points today.  </p><p>HERERA:  As of the close today, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P are within 1 percent  of historic highs.  The Dow stands about 3.5 percent away, all capable of  breaking through on any given day.  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes us on a ride to the top.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The markets are  knocking on the door of historic highs once again.  The S&amp;P 500 is less  than 1 percent from the record high.  How does he get here?  </p><p>The market has been moving on a powerful combination of factors.  First,  the earnings story is still going strong for the second half of the year  and for the third and fourth quarter, the guidance is not dropped at all.   We're still looking at gains of more than 20 percent for the third and  fourth quarter.  Those are big numbers.  </p><p>Second, while a small group of companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) have fallen victim to these tariff issues, the vast  majority of companies continue to see very little impact from the trade  wars.  </p><p>Third, there's been a tidal wave of buybacks announced this year.  The  companies are flushed with cash and it's a record $750 billion of buyback  that's been announced so far.  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is expecting $1  trillion by the end of the year.  That's a jump of about 50 percent from  last year.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone has already bought back more than $40  billion in stock this year.  </p><p>There's also a market rotation under way.  Despite the narrow rally, the  market's not been entirely dominated by technology.  When tech falters,  traders buy other sectors.  So, recently, we've also seen defensive value- oriented sectors like healthcare and banks and especially consumer staples  that have been strong in the last month.  </p><p>Finally, the U.S. continues to show signs of strength in its economy.  The  GDP growth is looking to be well over 3 percent for the rest of 2018.  So,  the big question now is, what will it take to get the S&amp;P 500 over the  finish line?  We're really close.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the question surrounding the market any time new highs are  that close: is there enough support to keep the rally going?  </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look for us.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The major stock  indexes are poised to return to record highs lasting more than six months  ago, but one criticism of this rally remains popular, that the market is  too reliant on a small group of big tech stocks for its recent gain?  Is  this true?  Or is the climb broad enough to support further upside to new  record highs?  </p><p>There is some truth to the argument that the largest tech stocks such as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) have driven much of the market's gain.  Roughly half of the  increase of the S&amp;P 500 index has valued this year has come from those four  stocks alone, and the technology sector as a whole is up more than 16  percent compared to the S&amp;P 500's 7 percent rise, but it's not true that  those winners have obscured pervasive weakness below the surface.  </p><p>The majority of all stocks are up for the year, the equal weighted version  of the S&amp;P 500 in which each of the 500 stock has the same influence is up  nearly 5 percent for 2018.  More than twice as many large stocks are up 10  percent than have fallen that much.  And a Russell 2000 small companies  stock index has advanced some 10 percent.  </p><p>So, while investors have become somewhat more selective than in last year's  inclusive surge, with the strong preference for fast-growing technology  giant this year, it's not clear that the market is skewed toward a small  handful of winners at the expense of the majority of stocks.  The reason  investors do focus closely on the breakdown of market breadth is that major  market peaks are often preceded by an extreme narrowing of the market with  select big stocks holding up the indexes as the average stock suffers.  </p><p>With the bull market that began in 2009 set to become the longest on record  in the next few weeks, it makes sense to focus on these patterns.  So far,  at least, the rally seems just broad enough to fend off the bears.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So what will it take to get this market to the next level?  </p><p>Scott Kubie, chief investment officer at the Carson Group joins us now to  talk about that.</p><p>And I want to pick up on what mike kind of mentioned right at the end, and  that's the broadening out of the market because you also think that that's  important.  </p><p>SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CIO:  Yes.  We've seen really great leadership in  a small number of stocks, but I don't think that's going to get us to -- it  may get us to new highs, but it's not going to get us a really strong  return over the rest of the year and we think that we need a broader  participation especially from value stocks, which have really lagged growth  stocks by a wide margin this year.</p><p>I think one of the nice things is we saw that in July where value stocks  outperformed growth stocks by about a percent depending on the index you  use, and that's a very positive sign as we go into the second half of the  year.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, assuming that we are in the late portion of the cycle here  for this market.  The value is the place where people often look and you're  telling us to look for this particular value ETF tonight, right?  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes, one of the ETFs that we really like is the iShares Core S&amp;P  500 Value ETF and the ticker is ISUV.  There are a number of great value  ETFs out there, but one of the reasons we like it is that value stocks with  cheap relative to growth on a valuation basis.  Bbut also some of the  sector allocations toward financials and energy look to us to be really  attractive in the late cycle stage and we think the sectors are going to  outperform in the second half of the year and into 2019.  </p><p>HERERA:  You also are dabbling in the energy sector National Oilwell, the  ticker symbol is NOV.  You would also be looking at that.  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes.  That's an interesting story.  The National Oilwell Varco is a  supplier to a lot of the oil rig manufacturers.  And so, as we've seen a  strong, sustained rally in oil, it's caused manufacturers to go out and to  build more wells and hopefully order more equipment.  And as the supplier  to them, that late cycle stage is really very positive for them.  </p><p>They also supply a lot to offshore drillers and that's become much more  competitive and we've seen the overall shale production run into some  troubles in allowing oil prices to stay long for a long time.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>KUBIE:  That's a big help for the offshore drillers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Quickly, Scott, I want to get this one in because you talk about  the financials and if we are in a late cycle, usually inflation will start  to pick up.  So, you're looking at a TIPX SPDR here, as well, right?  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes.  I think this has had great risk reduction characteristics for  two risks that faced the market.  First, if the economy continues to stay  strong and employment continues to stay strong, we have the risk of  inflation picking up quite a bit, and so having some inflation protection  makes a lot of sense.  The other, though, is if we have these tariffs go  through and that ultimately raises consumer prices, we may be in a  situation where great interest rates may stay about the same, inflation may  rise quite a bit, and the overall real rates would fall.  </p><p>That would be especially positive for TIPX and that's one of the reasons  why we like them --  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>KUBIE:  -- as a low-risk portion in your portfolio.  </p><p>HERERA:  Scott, thank you very much.  Scott Kubie is with the Carson Group.  </p><p>Bill?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, job openings in the U.S. hovered near record highs in  June.  Job openings are a measure, of course, labor demand and they were  unchanged in June at 6.7 million.  The all-time high was the 6.8 million in  April.  The downside, the hiring rate slipped slightly.  </p><p>HERERA:  Last week's employment report showed 157,000 jobs created in July  and you can tack those on to the millions that have been created over the  past decade, under two presidents, one a Democrat, the other a Republican,  and both take credit for the number of jobs created.  But exactly who or  what is actually responsible?  </p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  How much do  presidents have to do with job creation?  </p><p>A look at the differences between President Obama and Trump shows sometimes  a lot and sometimes not much at all.  Under President Trump, 3.8 million  jobs have been created or 190,000 per month, counting the 20 months  starting after Trump's election November 2016.  </p><p>So in the prior 20 months of the Obama administration, that is from April  2015 to November 2016, 4.3 million jobs were created or a stronger 215,000  a month.  So, strong job growth continued under Trump that began under  Obama, and Trump has done well to keep it going, defying expectation of  economists that it would slow because of a lack of workers. </p><p>Four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs have been added under Trump  compared to just 21,000 for the 20 months under Obama.  That's a sign the  president's focus on manufacturing might be bearing some fruit, but it's  also mining and logging jobs which have grown by nearly 90,000 under Trump,  but fell by almost 200,000 under Obama.  This could be the result of policy  to deregulate the industry, but just as easily economists say the result of  higher oil prices, spurring U.S. production now versus oil prices that  reduced production under Obama.  </p><p>And there are some places where the trend under Obama simply continued  under Trump.  The transportation jobs remain as strong as they were, along  with professional and business services, along with education and health  care.  </p><p>Some job growth however has nothing to do with presidents.  More government  jobs were created under Obama than Trump.  But the biggest part of that  difference, local and state hiring over which presidents have little  control.  </p><p>So, there are definitely positive trends in the job market, all of which  most presidents will entirely take credit for, and they will be as they've  always been, just partially right.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>We begin with Argus, cutting its rating on CBS (NYSE:CBS) from buy to hold.   The analysts noting significant risk to those sexual allegations against  CEO Les Moonves, including his possible termination.  In fact, the  possibility that if Moonves were to be fired, the board may drop its fight  with the Redstone family to merge CBS (NYSE:CBS) with Viacom (NYSE:VIA) and  Argus believes if they were to merge, it would be a negative for  shareholders.  Shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) closed at $53.22, up a fraction  today.  </p><p>SeaWorld was upgraded at Macquarie from underweight to hold following the  company's strong earnings report.  Macquarie says that SeaWorld's  management is executing well and attendance growth in the first half of the  year was impressive.  The price target was raised from $10 to $26 and  today's SeaWorld shares closed at $25.58, up nearly 4 percent.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was cut at Argus from buy to hold on  concerns about gaming revenue growth in Macao.  Argus also lowered its  earnings outlook on Wynn for both this year and next, when shares climbed  just a fraction to $153.29.  </p><p>And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Zillow  from buy to neutral, citing concerns over the business model shift  following the company's purchase of mortgage lenders of America.  The  analysts say that could hurt Zillow's profits in fiscal 2019.  The price  target was also lower to $60 to $70.  Today, Zillow closed at $49.40, down  16 percent.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, trying to contain what has become California's  largest wildfire ever.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Firefighters in California continue to battle what has turned into  that state's largest fire in its history.  Eight major blazes are ravaging  California's landscape and have caused seven deaths and thousands of  evacuations.  </p><p>Aditi Roy joins us tonight from Ukiah, California.  </p><p>Good evening, Aditi.</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening to you,  Sue.</p><p>That's right, we are at the staging area for the Mendocino Complex Fire.   It is, as you mentioned, the largest wildfire in California history, nearly  the size of the city of Los Angeles and it is growing at unprecedented  rate.  Of the fire, it's actually comprised of two fires, the River Fire  and the Ranch Fire.  </p><p>The Ranch Fire is the bigger of the two.  It is more than 240,000 acres and  just more than 20 percent contained.  Eleven thousand three hundred  structures are threatened, 75 homes and businesses destroyed and 13,000  people have been ordered to evacuate.  An additional 8,000 have been  advised to do so.  </p><p>Fire officials tell us the weather conditions combined with the remote  location of the flames make it an especially tough fire fight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE KAUFMANN, CAL FIRE SPOKESMAN:  It's been a challenge for us to get  our crews in there because it's in a mountain range and a ridge top, and  so, we're still currently trying to get good, active containment line in  those areas.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROY:  There's nearly 4,000 firefighters here on scene and they have dumped  more than 100 million gallons of fire retardant, Sue, a massive show of  manpower and resources.  </p><p>HERERA:  Indeed.  Thank you so much, Aditi.  Aditi Roy tonight.  </p><p>Bill?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Profits disappointed at Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA),  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The entertainment giant said restructuring costs tied to its recent  acquisition of Scripts Network caused it to decline at a faster than  expected clip, revenue was a beat, though, helped by higher sales in the  company's international networks.  Shares closed down 5 percent to $25.55.  </p><p>Dairy producer Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) reported a loss but did see sales inch  ahead of expectations.  The company also slashed its earnings outlook for  the whole year citing inflationary pressures and growing competition from  private labels.  Shares plunged by 15 percent today to $8.04.  </p><p>HERERA:  More bad news from Papa John's.  After the closing bell, the pizza  chain said same-store sales declined across its U.S. stores causing  earnings to come up short.  Papa John's sees more pain ahead.  It cut its  outlook for the full year.  </p><p>The company's founder recently stepped down from his chairman role after he  apologized for using a racial slur during a conference call.  Shares fell  in the after-hours and also finished the regular down nearly 3 percent to  $41.07.  </p><p>And after the bell, Snap reported a decline on the number of active daily  users on its platform.  Despite using estimates for user growth, the social  media company beat earnings expectations which it said were helped by  strong performance in its ad business.  Also, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin  Talal said that he has bought a more than 2 percent stake in the company.   Shares initially jumped in the extended session but then fell back.  They  ended the regular day up half a percent to $13.12.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, things were slowly getting become to normal today after  Beijing's financial district was locked down amid protests.  The catalyst  was a meltdown in China's peer to peer lending market.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing to shed some light on this growing crisis there.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was business as  usual in Beijing's financial district today after yesterday's police  crackdown on protesters.  Organizers say thousands of people gathered  outside the banking regulator's office.  Hundreds of police stopped the  demonstration.  </p><p>The protesters were angry about money they lost in a peer to peer lending  industry.  Here in China it's still very difficult for ordinary people to  get loans from mainstream banks, so this whole industry of peer to peer  lending has emerged where investors who have money to lend are connected to  people who need capital to start businesses or just to buy something.  This  industry has grown quickly over the past few years, thanks to the high  returns, about 8 percent to 12 percent compared to less than 3 percent at  most traditional banks.</p><p>But because of title regulatory conditions and a liquidity crunch, some of  the lenders have started to fail.  In China, public protesters aren't  common, but it is common for investors who lose money to expect the  government to bail them out and that is what the protesters were seeking  yesterday.  </p><p>The troubles for the P2P are far from over.  There are concerns that the  P2P problems can spread to business in other sectors.  In the past week,  two companies, one router manufacturer and one convenience store chain  reported financials associated with P2P investments.  That would pose a  headache for Beijing which is struggling have a rising debt and the risk  associated with it.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, a $54 billion merger faces resistance from within.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Cigna's proposed $54 billion deal to buy Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts is running into resistance from its highest profile investor.   Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn released an open letter urging his  fellow shareholders to vote against Cigna's deal to buy the pharmacy  benefits manager.  Cigna responded by saying that Mr. Icahn's view does not  represent those of Cigna's other shareholders.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs has been following the drama for us.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Carl Icahn called  Cigna's megadeal to acquire pharmacy benefits firm Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts a $60 billion folly.  The activist investor who has taken a stake  in Cigna is urging others to vote against the deal, arguing that the  insurers paying a 50 percent premium for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts at a  time when the pharmacy management business model is under siege from  regulators to the secretary of health and others who have been critical of  confidential rebate agreements which allow the PBMs to secure discounts  from drugmakers.  </p><p>Icahn also argues that Amazon's entrance into the pharmacy business  recently acquiring PillPack will also undermine the deal.  In his letter,  Icahn warns purchasing Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts would be one of the  worst blunders in corporate history, up there with the Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX)-AOL (NYSE:AOL) fiasco and General Electric (NYSE:GE) valued  destruction.  </p><p>Icahn believed Cigna would be better off building its own pharmacy unit and  returning cash to shareholders.  </p><p>But Leerink analyst Ana Gupta who raised Cigna an outperform called Icahn's  proposals unrealistic.  She argues it would be a challenge for Cigna to  build a pharmacy unit with enough scale and that integrating medical and  pharmacy benefits is what will help insurers and PBM defend against the  pushback on rebates and against new entrants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who  will only have one piece of the puzzle for now.  </p><p>In response to Icahn, a spokesman for Express (NYSE:EXPR) Scripts said: We  believe that we are well-positioned for growth and remain confident in the  deal -- noting that they raised their guidance for client retention in the  recent earnings report.  Cigna declined to comment on the Icahn letter but  CEO David Cordani expressed confidence the deal would get done on last  week's earnings conference call.  </p><p>Icahn also suggested that the only Cigna shareholders who have reason to  support the deal are those who also own shares of Express (NYSE:EXPR)  Scripts.  (INAUDIBLE) stocks fund is the largest stakeholder in both firms,  he's declined to comment on the letter.  The shareholder vote is scheduled  for August 24th.  Shareholder advisory services are likely to weigh in on  the vote later this week.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here is another look at the final numbers for Wall  Street.  The Dow was a big winner, climbing 126 points to 25,628.  The  Nasdaq rose 23.  The S&amp;P 500 gained 8.  </p><p>And that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for watching and  happy birthday.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Oh, thank you very much.  Yes, I'm measuring my age now in  Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH).  That would be 16.

The week started  off on a high note, but will the days ahead usher in a new wave of  volatility?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Mission statement.  CEOs  redefined the role of corporate America, saying it`s not always about  maximizing profits for shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  The American consumer is flexing its muscle and powering the  economy, but does it have the staying power to keep the country out of  recession?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  August 19th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody.</p><p>And welcome.  Well, it was rally day on Wall Street today.  The rally was  broad.  Every sector was higher and there was some faint optimism over  trade which in turn helped ease some of last week`s concerns about a  potential recession.</p><p>Overall, the trading day did have a much different feel from what we  experienced last week which had intense swings both higher and lower.</p><p>Today, the industrial average was up 249 points to close back above 26,000.   Nasdaq added 160, S&amp;P gained 34.</p><p>But it`s only Monday.  And even though we`re in the dog days of summer,  this week promises to be anything but quiet.</p><p>Bob Pisani starts us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We have had quite a  rally over the last couple of days.  The Dow has moved up roughly 800  points since Thursday`s bottom.  Stocks bottomed precisely when the ten  year treasury bottomed right at 1.47 percent, as yields came off their  lows, so did the stock market.</p><p>Now, that shouldn`t be too surprising since stocks have been moving in  tandem with bond yields all month.  Much of today`s move higher can be tied  to fading fears of a possible recession in 2020, a point President Donald  Trump`s advisers repeatedly made over the weekend.  High hopes for  U.S./China relations are also adding fuel to the rally after the White  House decision to extend a reprieve given to Huawei given the Chinese  telecom giant 90 more days to buy supplies from American companies so it  can serve as existing customers.</p><p>Naturally, cyclical sectors like semiconductors and banks and retail led  the rebound today.  Defensive sectors like REITs and utilities, they  underperformed.  That`s a reversal of what we`ve been seeing for the  quarter and for most of 2019.  Still, there`s no shortage of catalysts  ahead that could move the markets this week, including a handful of retail  and home building earnings, manufacturing data and new home sales.</p><p>Plus, we`ll hear from global central banks.  Lots of chatter from Federal  Reserve officials at their annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, plus  the latest minutes from both the Fed and European Central Bank.  Busy week  even though it`s August.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, let`s turn now to Burns McKinney to talk more about what lies  ahead this week in the market.  He is the portfolio manager with Allianz  Global Investors.</p><p>Burns, nice to have you back.  Welcome.</p><p>BURNS MCKINNEY, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thank you so  much.</p><p>HERERA:  It does seem like it`s going to be a busy week even though we`re  in the middle of August.  And you think that the focus is going to be  firmly on the Fed later this week?</p><p>MCKINNEY:  Absolutely.  There certainly is -- there is a lot of economic  data.  We`ve been living in a market over the last several months that`s  really been moved by two primary factors.  Those being the rhetoric on  trade, and central bank activity and interest rates.  We spent the last  week and a half talking about trade and really we expect the markets to be  moved more than anything by what Jay Powell says in Jackson Hole this  Friday.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the consumer has certainly had something to say about this  as well, maintaining a strength-based on the strong jobs market and we get  all these retail earnings out this week.  What are your expectations for  that?</p><p>MCKINNEY:  Well, the consumer -- one thing I learned long ago was that  you`re going to lose money if you bet against the American consumer and  likewise the American consumer`s willingness to spend beyond their means.   And consumers have been strong.</p><p>I mean, you do have a very strong job situation.  Unemployment is near a  50-year low.  Consumer confidence is high.  Consumer balance sheets are  fairly clean right now as well.</p><p>And so, you know, we expect to see some good signs from the retail numbers  and, of course, there`s also been some divergence.  I mean, there`s been  winners and losers within retail.  You saw just over the past couple of  weeks, you saw a company like Macy`s (NYSE:M) that got hit hard versus you  saw Walmart actually report very strong and very good same store sales.</p><p>I think you do have certain players like the Walmarts of the world that  have been really disrupting retail alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have  been gaining shares for a lot of other retailers.</p><p>HERERA:  Where do you come down in terms of the debate that`s out there  right now about whether or not we`re in for a slowdown or we`re actually  going to go into recession?</p><p>MCKINNEY:  We don`t -- we don`t see a recession happening, at least over  the next 12 months.  You know, the market -- you know, the economy  certainly is slowing with the inversion of the yield curve, you know,  basically, to put it simply, that`s typically one of the best indicators of  a recession.  And so, that`s something that`s gotten investors a little bit  cautious.</p><p>But really in this case, it`s had a lot to do with being, you know,  interest rates being moved by race overseas.  And, you know, simply put  what it means is that that we do see the economic growth slowing.  We don`t  expect it to tip into recessionary territory, but probably just kind of dip  back into that that percent annual economic rut that we`ve had over the  last, really, hopefully, the last decade or so, which -- you know, it`s the  type of environment for which investors can still do fairly well.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Burns, thanks so much.</p><p>MCKINNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Burns McKinney with Allianz Global Investors.</p><p>And speaking of which, there are reports late tonight that White House  aides are looking at a payroll tax cut to help offset a weaker economy.   This follows a big push by the administration to ease fears of a possible  recession.</p><p>Eamon Javers picks up the story from their reporting tonight from the White  House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The White House went  into full messaging mode this weekend to try to push back on the idea that  there`s a recession coming just around the corner.  Call it all the  president`s economic men as the economic team here swarmed the broadcast  and cable nets with their upbeat economic message.</p><p>Between them, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and trade  advisor Peter Navarro appeared on four television networks in two days in  the wake of an extremely volatile week on Wall Street.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  I tell you what, I sure  don`t see recession.  We had some blockbuster retail sales, consumer  numbers towards the back end of last week really blockbuster numbers.</p><p>JAVERS:  Navarro disputed the widely held idea that the yield curve  inverted last week which is often a sign that a recession is coming.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR:  Technically, we did not have a  yield curve inversion.  An inverted yield curve requires a big spread  between the short and long end.</p><p>JAVERS:  And President Trump said it`s not the White House that`s limiting  economic growth, it`s the Fed.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Interest rates are low.  I  think I could be helped out by the Fed, but the Fed doesn`t like helping me  too much.</p><p>JAVERS:  The PR offensive continues again tomorrow off-air.  Larry Kudlow  is scheduled to host two conference calls tomorrow for business, state and  local leaders all about the president`s economic agenda.  The White House  says these calls were long planned and have nothing to do with recent  economic concerns.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers at the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The president of the Boston Fed today signaled that he is not in  favor of further interest rate cuts.  Eric Rosengren cited current economic  conditions that he described as good.  He also said that easing monetary  policy could encourage people to take on more risk and build up debt, and  that he said could worsen the next downturn and leave the Fed with few  policy tools.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, China is joining the chorus of global central banks  that are cutting interest rates but it`s not lowering them directly.   Instead, the Chinese central bank is reforming its interest rate policy by  gradually replacing its fixed benchmark lending rate with one that  fluctuates.  The hope is that it will lower borrowing costs for companies  and support growth.</p><p>HERERA:  America`s biggest companies are making a new pledge and  shareholder return is no longer the main objective.  The Business  Roundtable is changing its statement of, quote, the purpose of a  corporation, end quote.  The influential business group says decisions  should no longer be based solely on whether they will yield higher profits  for all shareholders.  Instead they should take all stakeholders into  account, including employees, customers and community.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So what could this new change to the corporate mission statement  potentially mean for you?</p><p>Joining us to talk about it is Charles Elson.  He`s director of the  Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p><p>Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHARLES ELSON, UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You`re not exactly enamored of this change in the mission  statement, are you?</p><p>ELSON:  Not at all.  It, frankly, is a rerun of the mission statements that  you saw many corporations thirty years ago which led to the whole corporate  governance movement, civil rights movement, because frankly, the more  people you are, quote, accountable to, the less likely a bad decision we`ll  ever have any consequence to you.</p><p>It`s like your watch.  The watch stops, it still gets the time right twice  a day.  You`ve got multiple constituencies you answer to, you`re going to  get right for somebody but that doesn`t mean a healthy business.</p><p>And for shareholders, being deep sixed like this, particularly given the  fact that today, everyone`s a shareholder through the retirement plan,  state pension plans and whatnot, it really will harm I think accountability  of management to the shareholders and the public frankly.</p><p>HERERA:  Those who support this move though say it`s a recognition that  corporations need to do more to help balance out the ever-growing income  inequality and that may mean engaging more with their employees and their  community.  But it doesn`t sound like, like you would be a fan of that?</p><p>ELSON:  Well, you know today a good shareholder profit corporation has to  take into account its employees in the community.  You`re never going to  get long-term profitability, which is what Delaware law has always said is  the is the raison d`etre of the corporation, to get to profitability unless  you take care of the stakes, where the employees, the community, customers  and suppliers.  Everyone does that.</p><p>But to change the polestar to reflect everybody, if you will, loses a sense  of accountability and ultimately creates a real mess.  Again, you know,  we`re all shareholders today.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>ELSON:  We all benefit when the company does well, and I think that they`ve  done is going back years which and that was really that the climate then  created the economic dislocations that resulted what we`re doing today.  If  they feel that strongly about it on pay and whatnot, let them cut their pay  by a two-thirds or so and give it back to their employees.  But they`re not  going to do that.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>ELSON:  And that`s the -- that`s what that`s why this thing is a little  disingenuous.  I`ve great respect for the Business Roundtable but this  thing was a bit self-serving in my view.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Charles Olsen with the University of Delaware, thanks for your  thoughts tonight.  I appreciate it.</p><p>OLSEN:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And speaking of new missions, Google`s original slogan was do no  evil when it went public years ago today.  Later in our program tonight,  we`re going to look at why Google`s strategy for the next 15 may be very  different.</p><p>HERERA:  But, first, the power of the American consumer.  As it changes, an  entire industry is remade.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  If you ever needed evidence of just how powerful the consumer  can be, take a look at the retail sector right now.  Looks a lot different  today than it did just a few years ago because as our buying habits  changed, a whole industry was transformed.</p><p>And tonight, Courtney Reagan takes a look at the American consumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While there are  many signs economic activity is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains strong.   Retail sales just posted the strongest five-month growth streak in more  than 13 years.  The consumer may be what`s holding up the us economy since  70 percent of economic activity is tied to consumer spending.</p><p>But where we shop in what we buy has changed.  More than a quarter of the  country`s malls have closed since retails real estate peak.  And today,  walk into any mall and you`ll see empty stores.  In less than three years,  there are 9,400 fewer stores overall.</p><p>Last year, more than 500 apartment stores closed their doors for good.   Bon-Ton liquidated, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) filed for bankruptcy and closed  hundreds of locations, JCPenney and Macy`s (NYSE:M) also went through a  store closure program.  We simply spend less at department stores than we  used to.</p><p>VINCE TIBONE, GREEN STREET ANALYST:  We do think there will be much more  department store closures over the next five to ten years.  Macy`s (NYSE:M)  has also had its, you know, struggles, but we think there`s a -- JCPenney  is really the most imminent concern from the department store front.</p><p>REAGAN:  The shift to online shopping and a higher portion of spending on  experiences instead of stuff has also pressured physical stores.  Put  together, the U.S. needs less retail space.  Online shopping accounts for  three-quarters of U.S. retail growth and half of all online shopping is  done on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) alone.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK, MASTERCARD EVP:  Retail is not that.  It`s very much  alive.  It`s just morphing.  It`s morphing to, again, become more digital  and morphing to accommodate the digital consumer who`s very savvy online  and understands how to get what they need and how to curate the products  that they need using the channels that they`re most comfortable with.</p><p>REAGAN:  When U.S. consumers aren`t waiting for online orders to arrive,  they`re spending on experiences.  In the 1960s, less than half of our  spending, which is services.  Now, it accounts for two-thirds.</p><p>Retail success takes more than just a strong consumer.  Shoppers have more  choices than ever before.  The winners have a mix of the right merchandise,  the right environment and the right experiences.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, can the consumer keep fueling this economy.</p><p>We`re joined now by Anthony Chukumba, managing director at Loop Capital.</p><p>Anthony, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>ANTHONY CHUKUMBA, LOOP CAPITAL MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  I guess that is the question.  I mean, Courtney laid it out  beautifully for us there.  Do you think that the consumer has staying power  and will continue to keep the economy healthy?</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  We think so.  The three main indicators that we look at to gauge  the health of the consumer are, first off, unemployment, which is that a  50-year low, wage growth which is at a 10-year high, and consumer  confidence was at a multi-year high.  So just as long as those three  indicators stay strong we see no reason that the consumer spending would  slow significantly anytime soon.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But Courtney also highlighted the store closures that we`ve seen  just breathtaking numbers over the last three years and it looks like we  could be in for another record number of closures this year.  Where are we  in that cycle right now, do you think?</p><p>I think that we`re getting to the middle, maybe toward the late innings of  that.  I mean, you know look the us was overstored even before the advent  of e-commerce.  But clearly, with more and more shopping going online, you  just don`t need as many physical stores.</p><p>Now one thing to remember is that there always are going to be some  retailers that are growing their stores, but, you know, but it`s -- but it  really isn`t a case-by-case basis.  So, for example, I cover five below  which has a very, very unique concept offering approximate below for teens  and tweens, and they`re growing and then part of that is the fact that that  it`s value, which a lot of consumers like and it`s also pretty sort of  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) resistant.</p><p>In general, do you think that the many of the retailers have as one guest  put it morphed and embraced the new ways that consumers shop?</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  The smart ones certainly have.  So I think about a company, for  example, like spy which is really significantly invested in their e- commerce channel.  But I`ll also figure out a great way to leverage the  store, so a significant portion of their online orders are actually picked  up in score -- in store.  Or I think of a couple like our RH which has made  their stores big and beautiful and very sort of experiential, they have  restaurants in their stores.  But they do 50 percent of their sales online.</p><p>So, the retailers that have the staying power from my perspective are the  ones who have adjusted to this new omnichannel reality that we`re living  in.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And this -- there may be no answer to this, but what will be the  right mix of brick-and-mortar versus online for in -- you know, particulars  stores out there to achieve success in this environment?</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  You know, that`s a good question.  I agree with you.  It`s  probably tough to come up with a precise answer.  But -- I mean, I do have  retailers like RH, like Williams Sonoma that do about 50 percent of their  sales online, so maybe that`s the right answer, right?  It`s 50 percent of  your sales online, 50 percent of the stores, and just really being able to  integrate the two of them and integrate those experiences.</p><p>HERERA:  Anthony, thanks so much for spending time with us.</p><p>Anthony --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  Anytime.</p><p>HERERA:  Sorry, Anthony.  Chukumba, with Loop Capital, I`ll get it next  time.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, Estee Lauder looks good to investors and that`s where  we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The cosmetics maker topped estimates thanks to growth in its skincare,  makeup and fragrance products.  Company also raised its full-year outlook,  but did say escalating U.S. and China trade tensions, Brexit and the Hong  Kong protests are still potential risks right now.  Estee Lauder though was  the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 today, up more than 12 percent to  $201.65.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is giving Minecraft video game more realistic  graphics by adding technology from chip maker Nvidia.  The new graphics  will bring improved upgrades to that game.  Nvidia shares jump seven  percent to $170.78.</p><p>And Chinese social media company Weibo reported what it called a notable  acceleration and user growth, which helped it top analyst earnings  estimates even though it narrowly missed on revenue.  Weibo also increased  its full-year revenue outlook.  Stock jumped more than 14 percent today to  $42.31.</p><p>HERERA:  PG&amp;E fell today after a judge ruled a jury could decide whether  the utility is responsible for a massive wildfire that killed 22 people and  damaged more than 5,000 buildings two years ago.  The company could face up  to billion $18 dollars in damages as the blaze was the second worst  wildfire in California history.  PG&amp;E shares lost more than a quarter of  their value.  They closed at $10.67.</p><p>Twitter suspended more than 900 accounts it believes are tied to China  running a disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protests.  Twitter  also said it would no longer receive advertising from state-controlled news  media entities.  Shares rose more than two percent to $41.70.</p><p>And after the bell, Baidu`s results topped expectations as the Chinese  Internet giant saw an increase in its daily app users.  Shares initially  rose in after-hours trading and they closed the regular session up nearly 8  percent to $104.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) made big acquisitions in its  first years as a publicly traded company but the next 15 may be different.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Various state attorneys general are reportedly moving forward  with an antitrust investigation into big tech.  According to \"The Wall  Street Journal\", that probe is likely to focus on whether a handful of  companies are using their power to stifle competition.  The investigation  apparently could be launched as soon as next month.</p><p>HERERA:  It has been years since Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) went public.  The  company started trading at $85 a share.  Since then the stock has surged  more than 2,600 percent.  And as Josh Lipton reports, that`s due in part to  its acquisition strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A $1,000 investment in  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the time of its IPO would now be worth about  $28,000 in part because of its major acquisitions.  There`s YouTube which  the company bought for more than one and a half billion dollars in 2006.   The video streaming powerhouse now generates an estimated $20 billion in ad  revenue per year.  There`s also Double Click which it bought for over $3  billion in 2007, that advertising platform helps power Google`s ad  business, which still accounts for the vast majority of Alphabet`s total  revenue.</p><p>But its biggest acquisition so far, more than $12 billion for Motorola  Mobility in 2012.  Less than two years later, it`s sold Motorola`s  smartphone business to Lenovo for just under $3 billion, but Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) did get to keep most of Motorola`s portfolio of mobile  patents, offering the company legal protection for its android operating  system.</p><p>To date, Alphabet has spent over $32 billion on acquisitions, 40 percent  more than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), almost 500 percent more than Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>But what about the quarters and years ahead?  Some analysts think  increasing regulatory scrutiny both here and abroad will hamper Google`s  ability to do some deals.</p><p>MARK MAHANEY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:  Them attempting to do a large $10  billion to $20 billion, $30 billion acquisition, a vertical integration  acquisition in the internet advertising space off the table.  Twitter --  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Twitter off the table and the reason is the  concentration, the large market share they already have in online  advertising.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) accounts for, you know, close to 50  percent of Internet ads spend in some markets.  It just wouldn`t be  allowed.  They wouldn`t be allowed to increase that share.</p><p>LIPTON:  Mahaney does think Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can still do relatively  smaller deals to build out its growing cloud business as it looks to close  the gap with industry leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT).  In fact, Google`s new cloud chief has already made it clear  that acquisitions will be an important part of his strategy, recently  announcing that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will buy a data analytics company  called Looker for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And finally tonight, an auction blunder.  On Friday, we told you  about this rare 1939 Porsche type 64 that went up for auction in Monterey  over the weekend.  It was expected to fetch at least $20 million.</p><p>But a misunderstanding caused some expensive confusion.  The bidding  started at $13 million, but the giant screen displaying bids in the room  showed $30 million.  When the bid hit $14 million, the big screen showed  $40 million, and when it got to $17 million and the auctioneer saw the big  screen displaying $70 million, he stopped the auction.</p><p>And since $17 million was below the reserve price, RM Sotheby`s pulled the  lot.  And the auction house said later this was in no way intentional on  behalf of anyone at RM Sotheby`s, rather an unfortunate misunderstanding  amplified by excitement in the room.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a look at the day`s final numbers from Wall  Street.  The Dow was up 249 points to close back above 26,000.  Nasdaq  added 106, S&amp;P 500 gained 34.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight, I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.  We want to remind you that this is the time of year your  public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  We always thank you for all of your support.   Have a great evening.  We`ll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The week started off on a high note, but will the days ahead usher in a new wave of volatility?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Mission statement. CEOs redefined the role of corporate America, saying it`s not always about maximizing profits for shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: The American consumer is flexing its muscle and powering the economy, but does it have the staying power to keep the country out of recession?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, August 19th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody.</p><p>And welcome. Well, it was rally day on Wall Street today. The rally was broad. Every sector was higher and there was some faint optimism over trade which in turn helped ease some of last week`s concerns about a potential recession.</p><p>Overall, the trading day did have a much different feel from what we experienced last week which had intense swings both higher and lower.</p><p>Today, the industrial average was up 249 points to close back above 26,000. Nasdaq added 160, S&amp;P gained 34.</p><p>But it`s only Monday. And even though we`re in the dog days of summer, this week promises to be anything but quiet.</p><p>Bob Pisani starts us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We have had quite a rally over the last couple of days. The Dow has moved up roughly 800 points since Thursday`s bottom. Stocks bottomed precisely when the ten year treasury bottomed right at 1.47 percent, as yields came off their lows, so did the stock market.</p><p>Now, that shouldn`t be too surprising since stocks have been moving in tandem with bond yields all month. Much of today`s move higher can be tied to fading fears of a possible recession in 2020, a point President Donald Trump`s advisers repeatedly made over the weekend. High hopes for U.S./China relations are also adding fuel to the rally after the White House decision to extend a reprieve given to Huawei given the Chinese telecom giant 90 more days to buy supplies from American companies so it can serve as existing customers.</p><p>Naturally, cyclical sectors like semiconductors and banks and retail led the rebound today. Defensive sectors like REITs and utilities, they underperformed. That`s a reversal of what we`ve been seeing for the quarter and for most of 2019. Still, there`s no shortage of catalysts ahead that could move the markets this week, including a handful of retail and home building earnings, manufacturing data and new home sales.</p><p>Plus, we`ll hear from global central banks. Lots of chatter from Federal Reserve officials at their annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, plus the latest minutes from both the Fed and European Central Bank. Busy week even though it`s August.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, let`s turn now to Burns McKinney to talk more about what lies ahead this week in the market. He is the portfolio manager with Allianz Global Investors.</p><p>Burns, nice to have you back. Welcome.</p><p>BURNS MCKINNEY, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Thank you so much.</p><p>HERERA: It does seem like it`s going to be a busy week even though we`re in the middle of August. And you think that the focus is going to be firmly on the Fed later this week?</p><p>MCKINNEY: Absolutely. There certainly is -- there is a lot of economic data. We`ve been living in a market over the last several months that`s really been moved by two primary factors. Those being the rhetoric on trade, and central bank activity and interest rates. We spent the last week and a half talking about trade and really we expect the markets to be moved more than anything by what Jay Powell says in Jackson Hole this Friday.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the consumer has certainly had something to say about this as well, maintaining a strength-based on the strong jobs market and we get all these retail earnings out this week. What are your expectations for that?</p><p>MCKINNEY: Well, the consumer -- one thing I learned long ago was that you`re going to lose money if you bet against the American consumer and likewise the American consumer`s willingness to spend beyond their means. And consumers have been strong.</p><p>I mean, you do have a very strong job situation. Unemployment is near a 50-year low. Consumer confidence is high. Consumer balance sheets are fairly clean right now as well.</p><p>And so, you know, we expect to see some good signs from the retail numbers and, of course, there`s also been some divergence. I mean, there`s been winners and losers within retail. You saw just over the past couple of weeks, you saw a company like Macy`s (NYSE:M) that got hit hard versus you saw Walmart actually report very strong and very good same store sales.</p><p>I think you do have certain players like the Walmarts of the world that have been really disrupting retail alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have been gaining shares for a lot of other retailers.</p><p>HERERA: Where do you come down in terms of the debate that`s out there right now about whether or not we`re in for a slowdown or we`re actually going to go into recession?</p><p>MCKINNEY: We don`t -- we don`t see a recession happening, at least over the next 12 months. You know, the market -- you know, the economy certainly is slowing with the inversion of the yield curve, you know, basically, to put it simply, that`s typically one of the best indicators of a recession. And so, that`s something that`s gotten investors a little bit cautious.</p><p>But really in this case, it`s had a lot to do with being, you know, interest rates being moved by race overseas. And, you know, simply put what it means is that that we do see the economic growth slowing. We don`t expect it to tip into recessionary territory, but probably just kind of dip back into that that percent annual economic rut that we`ve had over the last, really, hopefully, the last decade or so, which -- you know, it`s the type of environment for which investors can still do fairly well.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that note, Burns, thanks so much.</p><p>MCKINNEY: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Burns McKinney with Allianz Global Investors.</p><p>And speaking of which, there are reports late tonight that White House aides are looking at a payroll tax cut to help offset a weaker economy. This follows a big push by the administration to ease fears of a possible recession.</p><p>Eamon Javers picks up the story from their reporting tonight from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The White House went into full messaging mode this weekend to try to push back on the idea that there`s a recession coming just around the corner. Call it all the president`s economic men as the economic team here swarmed the broadcast and cable nets with their upbeat economic message.</p><p>Between them, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and trade advisor Peter Navarro appeared on four television networks in two days in the wake of an extremely volatile week on Wall Street.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: I tell you what, I sure don`t see recession. We had some blockbuster retail sales, consumer numbers towards the back end of last week really blockbuster numbers.</p><p>JAVERS: Navarro disputed the widely held idea that the yield curve inverted last week which is often a sign that a recession is coming.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR: Technically, we did not have a yield curve inversion. An inverted yield curve requires a big spread between the short and long end.</p><p>JAVERS: And President Trump said it`s not the White House that`s limiting economic growth, it`s the Fed.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Interest rates are low. I think I could be helped out by the Fed, but the Fed doesn`t like helping me too much.</p><p>JAVERS: The PR offensive continues again tomorrow off-air. Larry Kudlow is scheduled to host two conference calls tomorrow for business, state and local leaders all about the president`s economic agenda. The White House says these calls were long planned and have nothing to do with recent economic concerns.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers at the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The president of the Boston Fed today signaled that he is not in favor of further interest rate cuts. Eric Rosengren cited current economic conditions that he described as good. He also said that easing monetary policy could encourage people to take on more risk and build up debt, and that he said could worsen the next downturn and leave the Fed with few policy tools.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, China is joining the chorus of global central banks that are cutting interest rates but it`s not lowering them directly. Instead, the Chinese central bank is reforming its interest rate policy by gradually replacing its fixed benchmark lending rate with one that fluctuates. The hope is that it will lower borrowing costs for companies and support growth.</p><p>HERERA: America`s biggest companies are making a new pledge and shareholder return is no longer the main objective. The Business Roundtable is changing its statement of, quote, the purpose of a corporation, end quote. The influential business group says decisions should no longer be based solely on whether they will yield higher profits for all shareholders. Instead they should take all stakeholders into account, including employees, customers and community.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So what could this new change to the corporate mission statement potentially mean for you?</p><p>Joining us to talk about it is Charles Elson. He`s director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p><p>Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHARLES ELSON, UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE: Great to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You`re not exactly enamored of this change in the mission statement, are you?</p><p>ELSON: Not at all. It, frankly, is a rerun of the mission statements that you saw many corporations thirty years ago which led to the whole corporate governance movement, civil rights movement, because frankly, the more people you are, quote, accountable to, the less likely a bad decision we`ll ever have any consequence to you.</p><p>It`s like your watch. The watch stops, it still gets the time right twice a day. You`ve got multiple constituencies you answer to, you`re going to get right for somebody but that doesn`t mean a healthy business.</p><p>And for shareholders, being deep sixed like this, particularly given the fact that today, everyone`s a shareholder through the retirement plan, state pension plans and whatnot, it really will harm I think accountability of management to the shareholders and the public frankly.</p><p>HERERA: Those who support this move though say it`s a recognition that corporations need to do more to help balance out the ever-growing income inequality and that may mean engaging more with their employees and their community. But it doesn`t sound like, like you would be a fan of that?</p><p>ELSON: Well, you know today a good shareholder profit corporation has to take into account its employees in the community. You`re never going to get long-term profitability, which is what Delaware law has always said is the is the raison d`etre of the corporation, to get to profitability unless you take care of the stakes, where the employees, the community, customers and suppliers. Everyone does that.</p><p>But to change the polestar to reflect everybody, if you will, loses a sense of accountability and ultimately creates a real mess. Again, you know, we`re all shareholders today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>ELSON: We all benefit when the company does well, and I think that they`ve done is going back years which and that was really that the climate then created the economic dislocations that resulted what we`re doing today. If they feel that strongly about it on pay and whatnot, let them cut their pay by a two-thirds or so and give it back to their employees. But they`re not going to do that.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>ELSON: And that`s the -- that`s what that`s why this thing is a little disingenuous. I`ve great respect for the Business Roundtable but this thing was a bit self-serving in my view.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Charles Olsen with the University of Delaware, thanks for your thoughts tonight. I appreciate it.</p><p>OLSEN: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And speaking of new missions, Google`s original slogan was do no evil when it went public years ago today. Later in our program tonight, we`re going to look at why Google`s strategy for the next 15 may be very different.</p><p>HERERA: But, first, the power of the American consumer. As it changes, an entire industry is remade.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: If you ever needed evidence of just how powerful the consumer can be, take a look at the retail sector right now. Looks a lot different today than it did just a few years ago because as our buying habits changed, a whole industry was transformed.</p><p>And tonight, Courtney Reagan takes a look at the American consumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: While there are many signs economic activity is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains strong. Retail sales just posted the strongest five-month growth streak in more than 13 years. The consumer may be what`s holding up the us economy since 70 percent of economic activity is tied to consumer spending.</p><p>But where we shop in what we buy has changed. More than a quarter of the country`s malls have closed since retails real estate peak. And today, walk into any mall and you`ll see empty stores. In less than three years, there are 9,400 fewer stores overall.</p><p>Last year, more than 500 apartment stores closed their doors for good. Bon-Ton liquidated, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) filed for bankruptcy and closed hundreds of locations, JCPenney and Macy`s (NYSE:M) also went through a store closure program. We simply spend less at department stores than we used to.</p><p>VINCE TIBONE, GREEN STREET ANALYST: We do think there will be much more department store closures over the next five to ten years. Macy`s (NYSE:M) has also had its, you know, struggles, but we think there`s a -- JCPenney is really the most imminent concern from the department store front.</p><p>REAGAN: The shift to online shopping and a higher portion of spending on experiences instead of stuff has also pressured physical stores. Put together, the U.S. needs less retail space. Online shopping accounts for three-quarters of U.S. retail growth and half of all online shopping is done on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) alone.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK, MASTERCARD EVP: Retail is not that. It`s very much alive. It`s just morphing. It`s morphing to, again, become more digital and morphing to accommodate the digital consumer who`s very savvy online and understands how to get what they need and how to curate the products that they need using the channels that they`re most comfortable with.</p><p>REAGAN: When U.S. consumers aren`t waiting for online orders to arrive, they`re spending on experiences. In the 1960s, less than half of our spending, which is services. Now, it accounts for two-thirds.</p><p>Retail success takes more than just a strong consumer. Shoppers have more choices than ever before. The winners have a mix of the right merchandise, the right environment and the right experiences.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, can the consumer keep fueling this economy.</p><p>We`re joined now by Anthony Chukumba, managing director at Loop Capital.</p><p>Anthony, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>ANTHONY CHUKUMBA, LOOP CAPITAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: I guess that is the question. I mean, Courtney laid it out beautifully for us there. Do you think that the consumer has staying power and will continue to keep the economy healthy?</p><p>CHUKUMBA: We think so. The three main indicators that we look at to gauge the health of the consumer are, first off, unemployment, which is that a 50-year low, wage growth which is at a 10-year high, and consumer confidence was at a multi-year high. So just as long as those three indicators stay strong we see no reason that the consumer spending would slow significantly anytime soon.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But Courtney also highlighted the store closures that we`ve seen just breathtaking numbers over the last three years and it looks like we could be in for another record number of closures this year. Where are we in that cycle right now, do you think?</p><p>I think that we`re getting to the middle, maybe toward the late innings of that. I mean, you know look the us was overstored even before the advent of e-commerce. But clearly, with more and more shopping going online, you just don`t need as many physical stores.</p><p>Now one thing to remember is that there always are going to be some retailers that are growing their stores, but, you know, but it`s -- but it really isn`t a case-by-case basis. So, for example, I cover five below which has a very, very unique concept offering approximate below for teens and tweens, and they`re growing and then part of that is the fact that that it`s value, which a lot of consumers like and it`s also pretty sort of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) resistant.</p><p>In general, do you think that the many of the retailers have as one guest put it morphed and embraced the new ways that consumers shop?</p><p>CHUKUMBA: The smart ones certainly have. So I think about a company, for example, like spy which is really significantly invested in their e- commerce channel. But I`ll also figure out a great way to leverage the store, so a significant portion of their online orders are actually picked up in score -- in store. Or I think of a couple like our RH which has made their stores big and beautiful and very sort of experiential, they have restaurants in their stores. But they do 50 percent of their sales online.</p><p>So, the retailers that have the staying power from my perspective are the ones who have adjusted to this new omnichannel reality that we`re living in.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And this -- there may be no answer to this, but what will be the right mix of brick-and-mortar versus online for in -- you know, particulars stores out there to achieve success in this environment?</p><p>CHUKUMBA: You know, that`s a good question. I agree with you. It`s probably tough to come up with a precise answer. But -- I mean, I do have retailers like RH, like Williams Sonoma that do about 50 percent of their sales online, so maybe that`s the right answer, right? It`s 50 percent of your sales online, 50 percent of the stores, and just really being able to integrate the two of them and integrate those experiences.</p><p>HERERA: Anthony, thanks so much for spending time with us.</p><p>Anthony --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHUKUMBA: Anytime.</p><p>HERERA: Sorry, Anthony. Chukumba, with Loop Capital, I`ll get it next time.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, Estee Lauder looks good to investors and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The cosmetics maker topped estimates thanks to growth in its skincare, makeup and fragrance products. Company also raised its full-year outlook, but did say escalating U.S. and China trade tensions, Brexit and the Hong Kong protests are still potential risks right now. Estee Lauder though was the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 today, up more than 12 percent to $201.65.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is giving Minecraft video game more realistic graphics by adding technology from chip maker Nvidia. The new graphics will bring improved upgrades to that game. Nvidia shares jump seven percent to $170.78.</p><p>And Chinese social media company Weibo reported what it called a notable acceleration and user growth, which helped it top analyst earnings estimates even though it narrowly missed on revenue. Weibo also increased its full-year revenue outlook. Stock jumped more than 14 percent today to $42.31.</p><p>HERERA: PG&amp;E fell today after a judge ruled a jury could decide whether the utility is responsible for a massive wildfire that killed 22 people and damaged more than 5,000 buildings two years ago. The company could face up to billion $18 dollars in damages as the blaze was the second worst wildfire in California history. PG&amp;E shares lost more than a quarter of their value. They closed at $10.67.</p><p>Twitter suspended more than 900 accounts it believes are tied to China running a disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protests. Twitter also said it would no longer receive advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Shares rose more than two percent to $41.70.</p><p>And after the bell, Baidu`s results topped expectations as the Chinese Internet giant saw an increase in its daily app users. Shares initially rose in after-hours trading and they closed the regular session up nearly 8 percent to $104.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) made big acquisitions in its first years as a publicly traded company but the next 15 may be different.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Various state attorneys general are reportedly moving forward with an antitrust investigation into big tech. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", that probe is likely to focus on whether a handful of companies are using their power to stifle competition. The investigation apparently could be launched as soon as next month.</p><p>HERERA: It has been years since Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) went public. The company started trading at $85 a share. Since then the stock has surged more than 2,600 percent. And as Josh Lipton reports, that`s due in part to its acquisition strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A $1,000 investment in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the time of its IPO would now be worth about $28,000 in part because of its major acquisitions. There`s YouTube which the company bought for more than one and a half billion dollars in 2006. The video streaming powerhouse now generates an estimated $20 billion in ad revenue per year. There`s also Double Click which it bought for over $3 billion in 2007, that advertising platform helps power Google`s ad business, which still accounts for the vast majority of Alphabet`s total revenue.</p><p>But its biggest acquisition so far, more than $12 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2012. Less than two years later, it`s sold Motorola`s smartphone business to Lenovo for just under $3 billion, but Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) did get to keep most of Motorola`s portfolio of mobile patents, offering the company legal protection for its android operating system.</p><p>To date, Alphabet has spent over $32 billion on acquisitions, 40 percent more than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), almost 500 percent more than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>But what about the quarters and years ahead? Some analysts think increasing regulatory scrutiny both here and abroad will hamper Google`s ability to do some deals.</p><p>MARK MAHANEY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Them attempting to do a large $10 billion to $20 billion, $30 billion acquisition, a vertical integration acquisition in the internet advertising space off the table. Twitter -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Twitter off the table and the reason is the concentration, the large market share they already have in online advertising. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) accounts for, you know, close to 50 percent of Internet ads spend in some markets. It just wouldn`t be allowed. They wouldn`t be allowed to increase that share.</p><p>LIPTON: Mahaney does think Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can still do relatively smaller deals to build out its growing cloud business as it looks to close the gap with industry leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In fact, Google`s new cloud chief has already made it clear that acquisitions will be an important part of his strategy, recently announcing that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will buy a data analytics company called Looker for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And finally tonight, an auction blunder. On Friday, we told you about this rare 1939 Porsche type 64 that went up for auction in Monterey over the weekend. It was expected to fetch at least $20 million.</p><p>But a misunderstanding caused some expensive confusion. The bidding started at $13 million, but the giant screen displaying bids in the room showed $30 million. When the bid hit $14 million, the big screen showed $40 million, and when it got to $17 million and the auctioneer saw the big screen displaying $70 million, he stopped the auction.</p><p>And since $17 million was below the reserve price, RM Sotheby`s pulled the lot. And the auction house said later this was in no way intentional on behalf of anyone at RM Sotheby`s, rather an unfortunate misunderstanding amplified by excitement in the room.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, here`s a look at the day`s final numbers from Wall Street. The Dow was up 249 points to close back above 26,000. Nasdaq added 106, S&amp;P 500 gained 34.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight, I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us. We want to remind you that this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. We always thank you for all of your support.

The week started  off on a high note, but will the days ahead usher in a new wave of  volatility?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Mission statement.  CEOs  redefined the role of corporate America, saying it`s not always about  maximizing profits for shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  The American consumer is flexing its muscle and powering the  economy, but does it have the staying power to keep the country out of  recession?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  August 19th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody.</p><p>And welcome.  Well, it was rally day on Wall Street today.  The rally was  broad.  Every sector was higher and there was some faint optimism over  trade which in turn helped ease some of last week`s concerns about a  potential recession.</p><p>Overall, the trading day did have a much different feel from what we  experienced last week which had intense swings both higher and lower.</p><p>Today, the industrial average was up 249 points to close back above 26,000.   Nasdaq added 160, S&amp;P gained 34.</p><p>But it`s only Monday.  And even though we`re in the dog days of summer,  this week promises to be anything but quiet.</p><p>Bob Pisani starts us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We have had quite a  rally over the last couple of days.  The Dow has moved up roughly 800  points since Thursday`s bottom.  Stocks bottomed precisely when the ten  year treasury bottomed right at 1.47 percent, as yields came off their  lows, so did the stock market.</p><p>Now, that shouldn`t be too surprising since stocks have been moving in  tandem with bond yields all month.  Much of today`s move higher can be tied  to fading fears of a possible recession in 2020, a point President Donald  Trump`s advisers repeatedly made over the weekend.  High hopes for  U.S./China relations are also adding fuel to the rally after the White  House decision to extend a reprieve given to Huawei given the Chinese  telecom giant 90 more days to buy supplies from American companies so it  can serve as existing customers.</p><p>Naturally, cyclical sectors like semiconductors and banks and retail led  the rebound today.  Defensive sectors like REITs and utilities, they  underperformed.  That`s a reversal of what we`ve been seeing for the  quarter and for most of 2019.  Still, there`s no shortage of catalysts  ahead that could move the markets this week, including a handful of retail  and home building earnings, manufacturing data and new home sales.</p><p>Plus, we`ll hear from global central banks.  Lots of chatter from Federal  Reserve officials at their annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, plus  the latest minutes from both the Fed and European Central Bank.  Busy week  even though it`s August.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, let`s turn now to Burns McKinney to talk more about what lies  ahead this week in the market.  He is the portfolio manager with Allianz  Global Investors.</p><p>Burns, nice to have you back.  Welcome.</p><p>BURNS MCKINNEY, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thank you so  much.</p><p>HERERA:  It does seem like it`s going to be a busy week even though we`re  in the middle of August.  And you think that the focus is going to be  firmly on the Fed later this week?</p><p>MCKINNEY:  Absolutely.  There certainly is -- there is a lot of economic  data.  We`ve been living in a market over the last several months that`s  really been moved by two primary factors.  Those being the rhetoric on  trade, and central bank activity and interest rates.  We spent the last  week and a half talking about trade and really we expect the markets to be  moved more than anything by what Jay Powell says in Jackson Hole this  Friday.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the consumer has certainly had something to say about this  as well, maintaining a strength-based on the strong jobs market and we get  all these retail earnings out this week.  What are your expectations for  that?</p><p>MCKINNEY:  Well, the consumer -- one thing I learned long ago was that  you`re going to lose money if you bet against the American consumer and  likewise the American consumer`s willingness to spend beyond their means.   And consumers have been strong.</p><p>I mean, you do have a very strong job situation.  Unemployment is near a  50-year low.  Consumer confidence is high.  Consumer balance sheets are  fairly clean right now as well.</p><p>And so, you know, we expect to see some good signs from the retail numbers  and, of course, there`s also been some divergence.  I mean, there`s been  winners and losers within retail.  You saw just over the past couple of  weeks, you saw a company like Macy`s (NYSE:M) that got hit hard versus you  saw Walmart actually report very strong and very good same store sales.</p><p>I think you do have certain players like the Walmarts of the world that  have been really disrupting retail alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have  been gaining shares for a lot of other retailers.</p><p>HERERA:  Where do you come down in terms of the debate that`s out there  right now about whether or not we`re in for a slowdown or we`re actually  going to go into recession?</p><p>MCKINNEY:  We don`t -- we don`t see a recession happening, at least over  the next 12 months.  You know, the market -- you know, the economy  certainly is slowing with the inversion of the yield curve, you know,  basically, to put it simply, that`s typically one of the best indicators of  a recession.  And so, that`s something that`s gotten investors a little bit  cautious.</p><p>But really in this case, it`s had a lot to do with being, you know,  interest rates being moved by race overseas.  And, you know, simply put  what it means is that that we do see the economic growth slowing.  We don`t  expect it to tip into recessionary territory, but probably just kind of dip  back into that that percent annual economic rut that we`ve had over the  last, really, hopefully, the last decade or so, which -- you know, it`s the  type of environment for which investors can still do fairly well.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Burns, thanks so much.</p><p>MCKINNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Burns McKinney with Allianz Global Investors.</p><p>And speaking of which, there are reports late tonight that White House  aides are looking at a payroll tax cut to help offset a weaker economy.   This follows a big push by the administration to ease fears of a possible  recession.</p><p>Eamon Javers picks up the story from their reporting tonight from the White  House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The White House went  into full messaging mode this weekend to try to push back on the idea that  there`s a recession coming just around the corner.  Call it all the  president`s economic men as the economic team here swarmed the broadcast  and cable nets with their upbeat economic message.</p><p>Between them, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and trade  advisor Peter Navarro appeared on four television networks in two days in  the wake of an extremely volatile week on Wall Street.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  I tell you what, I sure  don`t see recession.  We had some blockbuster retail sales, consumer  numbers towards the back end of last week really blockbuster numbers.</p><p>JAVERS:  Navarro disputed the widely held idea that the yield curve  inverted last week which is often a sign that a recession is coming.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR:  Technically, we did not have a  yield curve inversion.  An inverted yield curve requires a big spread  between the short and long end.</p><p>JAVERS:  And President Trump said it`s not the White House that`s limiting  economic growth, it`s the Fed.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Interest rates are low.  I  think I could be helped out by the Fed, but the Fed doesn`t like helping me  too much.</p><p>JAVERS:  The PR offensive continues again tomorrow off-air.  Larry Kudlow  is scheduled to host two conference calls tomorrow for business, state and  local leaders all about the president`s economic agenda.  The White House  says these calls were long planned and have nothing to do with recent  economic concerns.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers at the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The president of the Boston Fed today signaled that he is not in  favor of further interest rate cuts.  Eric Rosengren cited current economic  conditions that he described as good.  He also said that easing monetary  policy could encourage people to take on more risk and build up debt, and  that he said could worsen the next downturn and leave the Fed with few  policy tools.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, China is joining the chorus of global central banks  that are cutting interest rates but it`s not lowering them directly.   Instead, the Chinese central bank is reforming its interest rate policy by  gradually replacing its fixed benchmark lending rate with one that  fluctuates.  The hope is that it will lower borrowing costs for companies  and support growth.</p><p>HERERA:  America`s biggest companies are making a new pledge and  shareholder return is no longer the main objective.  The Business  Roundtable is changing its statement of, quote, the purpose of a  corporation, end quote.  The influential business group says decisions  should no longer be based solely on whether they will yield higher profits  for all shareholders.  Instead they should take all stakeholders into  account, including employees, customers and community.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So what could this new change to the corporate mission statement  potentially mean for you?</p><p>Joining us to talk about it is Charles Elson.  He`s director of the  Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p><p>Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHARLES ELSON, UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You`re not exactly enamored of this change in the mission  statement, are you?</p><p>ELSON:  Not at all.  It, frankly, is a rerun of the mission statements that  you saw many corporations thirty years ago which led to the whole corporate  governance movement, civil rights movement, because frankly, the more  people you are, quote, accountable to, the less likely a bad decision we`ll  ever have any consequence to you.</p><p>It`s like your watch.  The watch stops, it still gets the time right twice  a day.  You`ve got multiple constituencies you answer to, you`re going to  get right for somebody but that doesn`t mean a healthy business.</p><p>And for shareholders, being deep sixed like this, particularly given the  fact that today, everyone`s a shareholder through the retirement plan,  state pension plans and whatnot, it really will harm I think accountability  of management to the shareholders and the public frankly.</p><p>HERERA:  Those who support this move though say it`s a recognition that  corporations need to do more to help balance out the ever-growing income  inequality and that may mean engaging more with their employees and their  community.  But it doesn`t sound like, like you would be a fan of that?</p><p>ELSON:  Well, you know today a good shareholder profit corporation has to  take into account its employees in the community.  You`re never going to  get long-term profitability, which is what Delaware law has always said is  the is the raison d`etre of the corporation, to get to profitability unless  you take care of the stakes, where the employees, the community, customers  and suppliers.  Everyone does that.</p><p>But to change the polestar to reflect everybody, if you will, loses a sense  of accountability and ultimately creates a real mess.  Again, you know,  we`re all shareholders today.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>ELSON:  We all benefit when the company does well, and I think that they`ve  done is going back years which and that was really that the climate then  created the economic dislocations that resulted what we`re doing today.  If  they feel that strongly about it on pay and whatnot, let them cut their pay  by a two-thirds or so and give it back to their employees.  But they`re not  going to do that.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>ELSON:  And that`s the -- that`s what that`s why this thing is a little  disingenuous.  I`ve great respect for the Business Roundtable but this  thing was a bit self-serving in my view.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Charles Olsen with the University of Delaware, thanks for your  thoughts tonight.  I appreciate it.</p><p>OLSEN:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And speaking of new missions, Google`s original slogan was do no  evil when it went public years ago today.  Later in our program tonight,  we`re going to look at why Google`s strategy for the next 15 may be very  different.</p><p>HERERA:  But, first, the power of the American consumer.  As it changes, an  entire industry is remade.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  If you ever needed evidence of just how powerful the consumer  can be, take a look at the retail sector right now.  Looks a lot different  today than it did just a few years ago because as our buying habits  changed, a whole industry was transformed.</p><p>And tonight, Courtney Reagan takes a look at the American consumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While there are  many signs economic activity is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains strong.   Retail sales just posted the strongest five-month growth streak in more  than 13 years.  The consumer may be what`s holding up the us economy since  70 percent of economic activity is tied to consumer spending.</p><p>But where we shop in what we buy has changed.  More than a quarter of the  country`s malls have closed since retails real estate peak.  And today,  walk into any mall and you`ll see empty stores.  In less than three years,  there are 9,400 fewer stores overall.</p><p>Last year, more than 500 apartment stores closed their doors for good.   Bon-Ton liquidated, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) filed for bankruptcy and closed  hundreds of locations, JCPenney and Macy`s (NYSE:M) also went through a  store closure program.  We simply spend less at department stores than we  used to.</p><p>VINCE TIBONE, GREEN STREET ANALYST:  We do think there will be much more  department store closures over the next five to ten years.  Macy`s (NYSE:M)  has also had its, you know, struggles, but we think there`s a -- JCPenney  is really the most imminent concern from the department store front.</p><p>REAGAN:  The shift to online shopping and a higher portion of spending on  experiences instead of stuff has also pressured physical stores.  Put  together, the U.S. needs less retail space.  Online shopping accounts for  three-quarters of U.S. retail growth and half of all online shopping is  done on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) alone.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK, MASTERCARD EVP:  Retail is not that.  It`s very much  alive.  It`s just morphing.  It`s morphing to, again, become more digital  and morphing to accommodate the digital consumer who`s very savvy online  and understands how to get what they need and how to curate the products  that they need using the channels that they`re most comfortable with.</p><p>REAGAN:  When U.S. consumers aren`t waiting for online orders to arrive,  they`re spending on experiences.  In the 1960s, less than half of our  spending, which is services.  Now, it accounts for two-thirds.</p><p>Retail success takes more than just a strong consumer.  Shoppers have more  choices than ever before.  The winners have a mix of the right merchandise,  the right environment and the right experiences.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, can the consumer keep fueling this economy.</p><p>We`re joined now by Anthony Chukumba, managing director at Loop Capital.</p><p>Anthony, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>ANTHONY CHUKUMBA, LOOP CAPITAL MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  I guess that is the question.  I mean, Courtney laid it out  beautifully for us there.  Do you think that the consumer has staying power  and will continue to keep the economy healthy?</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  We think so.  The three main indicators that we look at to gauge  the health of the consumer are, first off, unemployment, which is that a  50-year low, wage growth which is at a 10-year high, and consumer  confidence was at a multi-year high.  So just as long as those three  indicators stay strong we see no reason that the consumer spending would  slow significantly anytime soon.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But Courtney also highlighted the store closures that we`ve seen  just breathtaking numbers over the last three years and it looks like we  could be in for another record number of closures this year.  Where are we  in that cycle right now, do you think?</p><p>I think that we`re getting to the middle, maybe toward the late innings of  that.  I mean, you know look the us was overstored even before the advent  of e-commerce.  But clearly, with more and more shopping going online, you  just don`t need as many physical stores.</p><p>Now one thing to remember is that there always are going to be some  retailers that are growing their stores, but, you know, but it`s -- but it  really isn`t a case-by-case basis.  So, for example, I cover five below  which has a very, very unique concept offering approximate below for teens  and tweens, and they`re growing and then part of that is the fact that that  it`s value, which a lot of consumers like and it`s also pretty sort of  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) resistant.</p><p>In general, do you think that the many of the retailers have as one guest  put it morphed and embraced the new ways that consumers shop?</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  The smart ones certainly have.  So I think about a company, for  example, like spy which is really significantly invested in their e- commerce channel.  But I`ll also figure out a great way to leverage the  store, so a significant portion of their online orders are actually picked  up in score -- in store.  Or I think of a couple like our RH which has made  their stores big and beautiful and very sort of experiential, they have  restaurants in their stores.  But they do 50 percent of their sales online.</p><p>So, the retailers that have the staying power from my perspective are the  ones who have adjusted to this new omnichannel reality that we`re living  in.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And this -- there may be no answer to this, but what will be the  right mix of brick-and-mortar versus online for in -- you know, particulars  stores out there to achieve success in this environment?</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  You know, that`s a good question.  I agree with you.  It`s  probably tough to come up with a precise answer.  But -- I mean, I do have  retailers like RH, like Williams Sonoma that do about 50 percent of their  sales online, so maybe that`s the right answer, right?  It`s 50 percent of  your sales online, 50 percent of the stores, and just really being able to  integrate the two of them and integrate those experiences.</p><p>HERERA:  Anthony, thanks so much for spending time with us.</p><p>Anthony --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHUKUMBA:  Anytime.</p><p>HERERA:  Sorry, Anthony.  Chukumba, with Loop Capital, I`ll get it next  time.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, Estee Lauder looks good to investors and that`s where  we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The cosmetics maker topped estimates thanks to growth in its skincare,  makeup and fragrance products.  Company also raised its full-year outlook,  but did say escalating U.S. and China trade tensions, Brexit and the Hong  Kong protests are still potential risks right now.  Estee Lauder though was  the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 today, up more than 12 percent to  $201.65.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is giving Minecraft video game more realistic  graphics by adding technology from chip maker Nvidia.  The new graphics  will bring improved upgrades to that game.  Nvidia shares jump seven  percent to $170.78.</p><p>And Chinese social media company Weibo reported what it called a notable  acceleration and user growth, which helped it top analyst earnings  estimates even though it narrowly missed on revenue.  Weibo also increased  its full-year revenue outlook.  Stock jumped more than 14 percent today to  $42.31.</p><p>HERERA:  PG&amp;E fell today after a judge ruled a jury could decide whether  the utility is responsible for a massive wildfire that killed 22 people and  damaged more than 5,000 buildings two years ago.  The company could face up  to billion $18 dollars in damages as the blaze was the second worst  wildfire in California history.  PG&amp;E shares lost more than a quarter of  their value.  They closed at $10.67.</p><p>Twitter suspended more than 900 accounts it believes are tied to China  running a disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protests.  Twitter  also said it would no longer receive advertising from state-controlled news  media entities.  Shares rose more than two percent to $41.70.</p><p>And after the bell, Baidu`s results topped expectations as the Chinese  Internet giant saw an increase in its daily app users.  Shares initially  rose in after-hours trading and they closed the regular session up nearly 8  percent to $104.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) made big acquisitions in its  first years as a publicly traded company but the next 15 may be different.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Various state attorneys general are reportedly moving forward  with an antitrust investigation into big tech.  According to \"The Wall  Street Journal\", that probe is likely to focus on whether a handful of  companies are using their power to stifle competition.  The investigation  apparently could be launched as soon as next month.</p><p>HERERA:  It has been years since Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) went public.  The  company started trading at $85 a share.  Since then the stock has surged  more than 2,600 percent.  And as Josh Lipton reports, that`s due in part to  its acquisition strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A $1,000 investment in  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the time of its IPO would now be worth about  $28,000 in part because of its major acquisitions.  There`s YouTube which  the company bought for more than one and a half billion dollars in 2006.   The video streaming powerhouse now generates an estimated $20 billion in ad  revenue per year.  There`s also Double Click which it bought for over $3  billion in 2007, that advertising platform helps power Google`s ad  business, which still accounts for the vast majority of Alphabet`s total  revenue.</p><p>But its biggest acquisition so far, more than $12 billion for Motorola  Mobility in 2012.  Less than two years later, it`s sold Motorola`s  smartphone business to Lenovo for just under $3 billion, but Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) did get to keep most of Motorola`s portfolio of mobile  patents, offering the company legal protection for its android operating  system.</p><p>To date, Alphabet has spent over $32 billion on acquisitions, 40 percent  more than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), almost 500 percent more than Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>But what about the quarters and years ahead?  Some analysts think  increasing regulatory scrutiny both here and abroad will hamper Google`s  ability to do some deals.</p><p>MARK MAHANEY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:  Them attempting to do a large $10  billion to $20 billion, $30 billion acquisition, a vertical integration  acquisition in the internet advertising space off the table.  Twitter --  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Twitter off the table and the reason is the  concentration, the large market share they already have in online  advertising.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) accounts for, you know, close to 50  percent of Internet ads spend in some markets.  It just wouldn`t be  allowed.  They wouldn`t be allowed to increase that share.</p><p>LIPTON:  Mahaney does think Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can still do relatively  smaller deals to build out its growing cloud business as it looks to close  the gap with industry leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT).  In fact, Google`s new cloud chief has already made it clear  that acquisitions will be an important part of his strategy, recently  announcing that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will buy a data analytics company  called Looker for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And finally tonight, an auction blunder.  On Friday, we told you  about this rare 1939 Porsche type 64 that went up for auction in Monterey  over the weekend.  It was expected to fetch at least $20 million.</p><p>But a misunderstanding caused some expensive confusion.  The bidding  started at $13 million, but the giant screen displaying bids in the room  showed $30 million.  When the bid hit $14 million, the big screen showed  $40 million, and when it got to $17 million and the auctioneer saw the big  screen displaying $70 million, he stopped the auction.</p><p>And since $17 million was below the reserve price, RM Sotheby`s pulled the  lot.  And the auction house said later this was in no way intentional on  behalf of anyone at RM Sotheby`s, rather an unfortunate misunderstanding  amplified by excitement in the room.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a look at the day`s final numbers from Wall  Street.  The Dow was up 249 points to close back above 26,000.  Nasdaq  added 106, S&amp;P 500 gained 34.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight, I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.  We want to remind you that this is the time of year your  public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  We always thank you for all of your support.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report in November wrote, quote: We expect the  drag from the trade war to fade gradually although much could go wrong.  We  now expect a phase one agreement signed in coming weeks, end quote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the president said yesterday, there may not be a trade deal until  after the 2020 elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Ferally (ph) at J.P. Morgan said, quote: We never swung all the way to  thinking trade peace was breaking out.  It`s not like we have to do a big  pivot here.</p><p>Goldman has a more upbeat 2020 outlook at 2.3 percent.  J.P. Morgan not  banking on trade peace, only 1-1/2 percent.  UBS, most pessimistic of all  at just above 1 percent.</p><p>We contacted a half dozen economists after the president`s comments, most  have just about had it with taking out the erasers.  On average, they see  the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next as the bottom of  the slowdown.</p><p>Growth is seen ramping up to 2 percent by the end of the next year.  In  general, economists are inclined to assume the worst on trade and be  pleasantly surprised if they`re wrong.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  And then there`s housing, a  pillar of the economy and probably your most valuable asset.  A new report  tonight paints an unexpectedly harsh picture for the market next year.</p><p>And it got the attention of prospect of buyers, sellers, home owners and  investors.</p><p>Here is Diana Olick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Almost everything is  in place for a strong start to 2020 housing market -- growing demand, a  stable job market and low mortgage rates.  But one critical thing is  missing.  Enough homes for sale.</p><p>GEORGE RATIU, REALTOR.COM SENIOR ECONOMIST:  We`re running out of product  to sell.  So, if you can`t sell it, obviously, even with demand, prices  don`t have anywhere to go.</p><p>OLICK:  Realtor.com is forecasting a slowdown for housing next year, and a  potential record low supply of available homes.  Low inventory will cause  sales to drop just under 2 percent from this year and home prices will  flatten nationally.  As millennials who will account for half the buying  market struggle to afford overheated prices.</p><p>RATIU:  What they do find in terms of product, they have all upper end for  new product.  The only existing inventory that they can really enter at is  the existing home sales pipeline.  And there, they are basically running  out of products.</p><p>OLICK:  In some major markets, realtor.com is predicting prices could go  negative, the first time that`s happened since the housing crash.  Those  cities include Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Miami, Detroit, St. Louis and  San Francisco.  With home values weakening, sellers will have little  incentive to put their homes on the market because nobody wants to catch a  falling knife.  That will only weaken supplies further.</p><p>Home construction is increasing and the forecast is for a 6 percent annual  gain.  But so far, it has largely been on the upper end of the market, not  at the entry level where demand is strongest.</p><p>The only good news in this report is that mortgage rates should remain low.   But low rates will only help if consumer confidence in housing is high.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Austin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Time to look at some of  today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We only have two for you tonight.  First, Marvell Technology downgraded to  market perform from outperform at BMO Capital.  The analyst says that the  semiconductor maker stock is reasonably valued right now.  Price target,  $28.  That stock fell about 5 percent today to $23.92.</p><p>And Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) (NYSE:GLW) was downgraded to neutral from buy  at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch.  The analyst says that the  long rumored breakup of the fiber glass company is not likely in the near  term.  Price target, $72.  Shares fell a fraction today to $65.43.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, United Airlines places a multibillion-dollar jet  order and it`s a blow to Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The White House is changing work requirements for some food  stamp recipients.  The new rules make it more difficult for states to waive  requirements that able-bodied adults without children work at least 20  hours a week or risk losing bifurcates.  Critics say that that could make  hundreds of thousands ineligible for the program.  But the administration  says it will get more people into workforce.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SONNY PERDUE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE:  What we`re doing here, people have  to work 20 hours a week or volunteer 20 hours a week or be in job training  for 20 hours a week.  What we want to do is increase employment.  We need  these people in the workforce.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The rules take effect in April of next year.</p><p>HERERA:  European plane maker Airbus announced a major order of its new  long range airplane.  The buyer is United Airlines, which is purchasing 50  of the jets.  It`s an order Boeing (NYSE:BA) could not compete with as it  tackles a number of issues, including the grounding of the 737 MAX.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  United Airlines is  turning to Airbus for its next generation of planes, to fly between the  East Coast of the U.S. and destinations in Europe.  The airline is buying  50 Airbus A321XLR planes.  First flight, 2024.</p><p>United did not place an order for long-range planes with Boeing (NYSE:BA),  in part because Boeing (NYSE:BA) does not have a model that fits United`s  needs.  Earlier this year, Airline executives expected Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO  Dennis Muilenburg to announce plans for a in new long range model.  That  never happened, due in part to the grounding of the 737 MAX, which had  become the primary focus for the company.</p><p>So, airlines like American will fly the new Airbus planes, between  destinations that are further apart like the U.S. to Europe where U.S.  carriers are battling foreign airlines who get higher marks in a new survey  of travelers flying from North America to Europe and Asia.</p><p>To Europe, those surveyed by JD Power ranked Turkish Airlines first, then  Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Delta tied for third.</p><p>A big reason some airlines ranked higher than others for international  trips, what they serve passengers.</p><p>MICHAEL TAYLOR, J.D. POWER:  The food and beverage service is actually a  little bit more important to the satisfaction.  And that`s really because  food and beverages interaction between, you know, the airline and the staff  that`s in the aircraft itself --</p><p>LEBEAU:  Those flying to Asia put Japan Airlines at the top, followed by  Delta, Korean Air and the Japanese carrier ANA.</p><p>JD Power says U.S. airlines are not far behind the foreign competitors when  it comes to flights to Europe and Asia, and they could further improve as  Delta, American and United make further investments in their international  routes.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And we`re learning that Boeing`s chief engineer who led Boeing`s  response to the crashes is retiring.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Last night, we told you about the transition of power at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) parent company Alphabet.  Gaggle cofounder Sergey Brin and  Larry Page are stepping back.  And current Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar  Pichai is also going to be become the parent -- the CEO of the parent  company Alphabet.</p><p>And as Deirdre Bosa reports now, the new boss faces a list of challenges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It`s the end of an  era at one of tech`s biggest and most successful companies.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are handing over  the reins to engineer-turned-manager Sundar Pichai.  Pichai has already  been overseeing the company`s core business as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO but  now as Alphabet CEO, is he ready to take the company into the next decade,  one that is fraught with more challenges and threats than ever?</p><p>Regulatory battles in the U.S. and Europe are brewing.  Employee activism  is on the rise.  And privacy practices are under fire.</p><p>Now, Pichai is relatively untested when it comes to the type of battles  other big tech CEOs like Facebook`s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple`s Tim Cook  have been fighting.</p><p>Another challenge for Pichai could be actual control.  While he gets the  full CEO title, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are still Alphabet`s biggest  individual shareholders, they still retain control through their majority  voting power.</p><p>Day to day, not a lot is changing in Alphabet.  Pichai will continue to run  Google`s most important and profitable businesses, while now also  overseeing its more ambitious moon shot projects.</p><p>On the horizon, though, Pichai has his work cut out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Campbell`s reports soupy sales, and that`s where we begin  tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Campbell`s Soup sold fewer of its namesake products in the U.S. in the most  recent quarter, but the company did see an increase in its share of the  soup market, for the first time in 10 quarters.  And its earnings came in  better than expected.</p><p>That was enough to lift the stock which rose about 2 percent to $48.47.  It  hit a 52-week high during the session.</p><p>Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is replacing its CEO and CFO following a strategy  disagreement with the board of directors.  Earlier this year, Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) sought to unite its brands, including Orbitz, hotels.com and  VRBO, but the chairman of the board said the strategy failed and led to  disappointing results.  Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares were up 6 percent to  $105.56.</p><p>Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) sold its Ballast Point craft beer unit to a  small Illinois brewery for an undisclosed amount.  Constellation bought  ballast point in 2015 for a record $1 billion.  This deal is believed to be  below that amount as the market for craft beer has slowed.  Shares were off  a fraction today to $184.29.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  G-III apparel group missed sales estimates for the third quarter  and they`ve lowered guidance as a result.  Company which owns brands like  Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger blamed the shortfall on trade  tariffs.  G-III fell 2 percent today to $27.89.</p><p>Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) said it sees fourth quarter shipping volume down a  little more than 10 percent and the rail operator also expects revenue to  slip by about that same amount.  But after falling for five straight  sessions, the stock actually rose 2 percent today to $171.46.</p><p>Instructure is being acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo.  The  price tag is about $2 billion or $47.60 a share.  That`s actually 10  percent below yesterday`s closing price.  Last month, the education  software company said it was reviewing some strategic options.  Instructure  dropped 8 percent today to $48.75.</p><p>HERERA:  Following YouTube`s recent landmark $170 million settlement with  regulators, for alleged violation of children`s privacy laws, the company  is changing its policies and restricting some features around content aimed  at kids.  But that is not going over well with creators.</p><p>Ylan Mui has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Jeremy Johnston normally  fills his day was family.</p><p>JEREMY JOHNSTON, J HOUSE VLOGS CREATOR:  All right. Who wants to help me.</p><p>MUI:  And plenty of fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One, two, three, go!</p><p>MUI:  And he shares it all on his YouTube channel with his 2 million  subscribers.  It`s a full-time job and a big business.  It takes up to 40  people to put together all these videos but lately, the most important  place for Johnson to be is Washington, D.C.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  We`re trying to inform the FTC commissioners and legislators how  the regulation is going to impact creators who make family-friendly  content.</p><p>MUI:  Johnson is worried his channel and his ad revenue will take a hit.   That`s because YouTube is changing the way it handles content aimed at  kids.  Personalized ads will be banned and features like comments,  suggested videos and play lists will be turned off.</p><p>It all comes after the company was forced to pay a record $136 million to  the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that it illegally collected  children`s personal data.  Privacy advocates say the change is long  overdue.</p><p>JOSH GOLIN, CAMPAIGN FOR A COMMERCIAL-FREE CHILDHOOD:  I do understand this  is going to affect the bottom line and they`re upset about that.  But one  thing they need to recognize is that the business model that they were  using was an illegal one.</p><p>MUI:  Some content creator predict their ad revenue could plunge 60 to 90  percent.  So, now, they`re fighting back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is very serious.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Family-friendly content is in danger right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We may not be able to create content on YouTube.</p><p>MUI:  Creators argue that YouTube`s new rules discourage them from making  content for kids because they can`t make money doing it.  Some of them  could move to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) where the  rules are different.  But most of all, they just want Washington to hear  their side.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  As they`re getting this new information, they are reconsidering,  they`re thinking about it, and they`re realizing that this is a bigger  problem.  They don`t want the unintended consequences.</p><p>MUI:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, we`re going to take to you a store that has no  inventory but it does have a daily snow store.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here is what we`re watching tomorrow.</p><p>This is highly anticipated.  Biogen is presenting data from its  experimental Alzheimer`s drug six weeks after the company said it was  bringing the treatment back from the dead.  That should be interesting.</p><p>Members of OPEC meet to decide on production levels.  Jobless claims,  international trade and factory orders are all on the economic calendar as  well.  That`s what we are watching tomorrow, Thursday.</p><p>HERERA:  Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen is in talks to increase its stake  in the New York Mets.  There are reports that Cohen could end up  controlling 80 percent of the baseball team.  Under the agreement, Fred  Wilpon would remain CEO of the Mets for five years.  In April, \"Forbes\"  valued the New York Mets at $2.3 billion.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, as the retail industry evolves in this digital  age, stores are popping up that have no merchandise for shoppers to take  home.  Canada Goose is the retailer to open a so-called experience store,  one it hopes helps consumer understand why Canada Goose outer wear is worth  the $1,000 price tag.</p><p>Courtney Reagan went to Toronto to experience it for herself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We`re in a mall in  Toronto, but this new Canada Goose store is not really a store at all, but  an experience.  We`re going to take you inside.</p><p>The entrance of the store is called the crevasse.  It literally means deep  crack in the glacier.  As you walk, it sounds as if the galls is cracking  under your feet.  The walls are made to look and feel like rock.  And you  can hear above the sound track of the arctic.</p><p>Then you enter the elements room.  It`s surrounded by curved walls  projecting nature films shot in British Columbia.  Those films will change  as the seasons change.  In the middle of the room, mannequins and the gear  will complement the season.</p><p>Now, you`re in the gear room.  This is meant to be a reinterpretation of a  seed vault, which is in Norway, storing the world`s seeds in case of  pandemic.  It`s located in the permafrost.</p><p>You`re going to get a brief explanation of the merchandise and you`re going  to choose the gear that`s most appropriate for you and how you deal with  cold.  And then, you`re going to take it inside the cold room.</p><p>Now you`re in the cold room.  This is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but can  get as low as negative 4 degrees.  It`s meant to simulate arctic  conditions.</p><p>Canada goose has other cold rooms, but this is the only one with actual  snow.</p><p>DANI REISS, CANADA GOOSE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  What`s really important is the  experience and to be experimental and to try new things.  Especially in  this day and age whereas we all know retail is changing.</p><p>REAGAN:  If the Canada Goose journey store did its job, you`ll actually  leave empty handed.  There`s no inventory here.  But you can come to one of  the kiosks, pick out the item that you like and it can be delivered to your  home the same day or the next day if you live right here in the Toronto  area.</p><p>The no inventory store is part of Canada Goose`s growing direct to consumer  business, which makes up about a quarter of totals sales.  But the new  experience may not be enough to convince investors that have given the  stock the cold shoulder.  Shares are down 45 percent from the all-time  highs set last November, and down more than 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in Toronto, Canada.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  That is very cool.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>HERERA:  Literally.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Literally, yes.</p><p>HERERA:  That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.   Thanks for watching.</p><p>We`d like to remind you that this is the time of year your public  television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Thank you for that support.  Have a great  evening.  We`ll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.
