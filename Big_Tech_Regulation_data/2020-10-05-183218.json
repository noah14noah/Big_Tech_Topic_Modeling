Oh right, you can't.\"</p><p>Dan Baer, a former Obama administration official who's in the Democratic race to unseat Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), also went on the offensive -- accusing the Republican of standing with McConnell to oppose election security bills:</p><p>The Senate Democrats' campaign arm was also fundraising yesterday on a pledge to oust vulnerable Senate Republicans who oppose election security bills:</p><p>Even a group of Republicans opposed to President Trump announced it would run ads criticizing McConnell's opposition to election security legislation in Washington and Kentucky:</p><p>After testimony from former special counsel Robert Mueller, Democrats sought to force votes on election security bills that many Republicans oppose, including ones that would give states an influx of cash to upgrade voting systems and require candidates to report offers of hacker material from foreign nationals.\u00a0</p><p>Yet McConnell argues that\u00a0imposing federal mandates on election security -- even if security experts say they're best practices --\u00a0would violate states' rights to run their own elections.</p><p>\"My opposition to nationalizing election authorities that properly belong with the states is not news to anybody who's followed my career or knows anything about Congress,\" McConnell said.</p><p>Democrats counter that state and local election officials aren't equipped to defend themselves against the sort of top-notch cyber pros from Russia's intelligence services who probed the election infrastructure in numerous states\u00a0in 2016 and ran a hacking and influence campaign aimed at helping the\u00a0Trump campaign and hurting Hillary Clinton.\u00a0</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has led the fight to pressure McConnell to consider election security bills, responded soon after McConnell spoke:</p><p>One of the main pundits McConnell in his speech targeted as part of the \"outrage industrial complex\"\u00a0was Post op-ed columnist Dana Milbank, who published an opinion column Friday headlined\u00a0\"Mitch McConnell is a Russian asset.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Fred Hiatt, The Post's editorial page editor, defended Milbank's column and criticized the GOP leader for invoking McCarthyism,\" my colleague Paul Kane reported.</p><p>\"Dana Milbank's column was a legitimate exercise in commentary, making the argument that Sen. McConnell's blocking of elections-security legislation will harm the United States and work to Russia's advantage. Of course it's equally legitimate for Mr. McConnell to express a contrary view, but the Milbank argument has nothing to do with McCarthyism,\" Hiatt said in a statement.</p><p>You are reading              The Cybersecurity 202          , our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.</p><p>             PINGED: A hacker accessed about 106\u00a0million credit card applications from Capital One, potentially exposing the names, addresses, dates of birth, and credit information of applicants in the United States and Canada,the company announced yesterday. Data from the hack included about 140,000 Social Security numbers and bank account numbers of approximately 80,000 consumers.</p><p>The FBI arrested\u00a0a suspect in the breach, Paige A. Thompson, a Seattle-based woman who worked in a cloud computing company that contracted with Capital One, after she posted to social media bragging about the attack, my colleague Devlin Barrett reports. Capital One believes it is unlikely Thompson disseminated any of the brached information or used it for fraud, the company said in a fact sheet.</p><p>Capital One was alerted to the social media posts on July 17 and immediately reported concerns to the FBI, Devlin writes. The hack is expected to cost the company upward of $150 million in the near term, but government regulators could go after the company for millions more.\u00a0No credit card numbers or log-in credentials were compromised in the breach, according to Capital One.</p><p>             PATCHED: Georgia will spend $106 million\u00a0on a contract with Dominion Voting Systems for a new statewide voting system in advance of the 2020 election, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergerannounced. The new machines are ballot marking devices, meaning voters cast their votes electronically but the machines print out a paper record so they can verify their votes were recorded accurately -- an upgrade that makes them more secure against hacking than the paperless touch-screen devices they're replacing, security experts say.</p><p>But\u00a0some critics\u00a0say that voters are unlikely to verify their votes using this method, making sucessful hacking more likely than with a fully paper-based system. Pending the result of one federal lawsuit, a U.S. District judge could still force the state to switch to a fully paper-ballot system.\u00a0</p><p>Marilyn Marks, the vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, the election integrity watchdog leading the suit, called the new system \"unconstitutional.\"</p><p>\"Elections security is my top priority,\" Raffensperger said in a news release. \"We look forward to working with national and local elections security experts to institute best practices and continue to safeguard all aspects of physical and cyber-security in an ever-changing threat environment.\"</p><p>             PWNED: China may be looking for a new bargaining chip in ongoing trade negotiations with the Trump administration by introducing cybersecurity regulations that could hurt U.S. businesses,Yoko Kubota at the Wall Street Journal reports.</p><p>The proposed regulations, which\u00a0implement\u00a0a 2017 Chinese cybersecurity law, could\u00a0make it more expensive for U.S. compnanies to do business in China and\u00a0prevent them from moving some of their data outside the country. Chinese officials seemed to be holding the regulations back during ongoing trade negotiations but moved forward after\u00a0the Trump administration decided to ban U.S. companies from selling parts to Huawei, a Chinese telecom giant the administration considers a national security threat, the Journal reported.</p><p>\"These are the tools in the arsenal that can be ready to be fired,\" Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity expert at New America, told the Journal.</p><p>While new rules haven't gotten as much attention as U.S. sanctions against China, the measures could be disastrous for big tech companies such as IBM, Dell, and Cisco, the Journal reports.

But even after the\u00a0Senate Commerce Committee spent two and a half hours questioning\u00a0some of the industry's top players, there are still little clues as to what such a law might look like.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Senior leaders from Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Google, Charter Communications and AT&amp;T offered few concrete recommendations,\u00a0as my colleague Cat Zakrzewski and I reported. And their divergent data collection practices, business models\u00a0and attitudes toward consumer privacy on display at the hearing highlight\u00a0how complicated\u00a0it's going to be for Congress to hammer out a single, sweeping bill,\u00a0let alone pass it.           (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns           The Washington Post.)       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senators acknowledged they were just getting the ball rolling. \"While this hearing grows out of recent concerns about consumer privacy, it is not intended to be a 'gotcha' hearing. Instead, it represents the beginning of an effort to inform our development of a federal privacy law that enjoys strong bipartisan support,\" Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said in the hearing. \"Politics is always about timing, and I believe now is the time to begin action on this important issue.\"</p><p>             Here are a few takeaways about where the debate is headed:\u00a0          </p><p>             1. Tech companies are holding their cards close for now. Calls for federal privacy legislation were prompted in large part by California's new privacy law and Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which put tough restrictions on what companies can do with user data. But witnesses hedged during Wednesday's hearing when senators asked them whether there was anything in those\u00a0policies that is worth emulating nationally. The witnesses were mum except for Len Cali, AT&amp;T's senior vice president for global public policy, who said only that he was pleased both laws applied uniformly to all companies.</p><p>The companies also kept their criticisms of the laws very general, too. Google, for instance, said complying with GDPR had been a \"tremendous challenge.\" And the executives said they worried that start-ups and other small businesses could struggle with compliance costs. But overall they avoided discussing specific proposals in depth. For example, when Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked whether companies should be required to notify customers of data breaches within 72 hours, they shook their heads silently. \"I'm going to take that as a no,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>             2. The companies agreed on broad privacy principles. The companies used the hearing to explain their companies' privacy frameworks to lawmakers. Executives from Twitter and Apple said they viewed privacy as a \"fundamental right.\" And all the witnesses said they supported making their privacy policies more transparent to customers and giving users more control over what companies can do with their data. But a privacy law that applies across a broad swath of tech and telecommunications companies, each with different ways they handle customer data, is a challenge lawmakers acknowledged.\u00a0\"There's often a temptation to lump technology leaders like this together, as if they are all the same,\" Thune\u00a0said.\u00a0</p><p>             3. Democrats are ready to push for an aggressive bill. A lot of Wednesday's discussion touched on whether federal privacy legislation should supersede California's law or any other state's privacy policies. The witnesses agreed that it should, saying they're concerned about having to comply with 50\u00a0 separate state laws that may vary widely. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said he understood their concerns, but warned them not to expect a watered-down bill. \"We're not going to\u00a0get 60 votes for anything and replace a progressive California law - however flawed you may think it is - with a nonprogressive federal law,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>             4. Republicans seem more wary of using California and Europe as models. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) voiced concerns about the Golden State's privacy law and GDPR, saying \"innovative and entrepreneurial businesses\" could be harmed by their regulatory overhauls. Thune, too, pondered whether some of GDPR's requirements would make it harder to launch start-ups or even discourage small companies from doing business in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>             5. Some lawmakers still have a lot to learn. Even though technology executives are making more regular trips to the Hill, a deep divide remains between how lawmakers and tech officials talk about privacy issues. The divergence was on display in one exchange between Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Google Chief Privacy Officer Keith Enright. Tester held up his iPhone and told the witness it sometimes \"mystifies\" him. He then pressed Enright on how the company's ads work.</p><p>\"I'll get on and look for a set of tires for, say, my semi truck,\" Tester said. \"And, presto-chango, I might be checking scores on ESPN or weather on some other weather channel, and up comes an advertisement for tires for my truck. How the hell do they get that information?\"</p><p>Enright launched into an explanation of Google's advertising platform.\u00a0\"I want to be very clear - we understand the complexity of the Internet ecosystem,\" Enright said. \"I don't,\" Tester responded.</p><p>             6. Congress has yet to hear from a long list of stakeholders. There are many stakeholders who weren't at Wednesday's hearing who could shake up the debate.\u00a0Consumer advocacy groups were absent, and they will be sure to fight any attempts to roll back strong state-level regulation. Big tech loves to argue that any regulation will stifle innovation, but no small companies were present to talk about whether GDPR or the California privacy law have created major burdens that hurt their businesses. Academics who study privacy and who can offer empirical evidence on these topics weren't in attendance. Though three of the big five tech giants appeared at the hearing, Facebook and Microsoft were not there, and are sure to also want to play a role in this bill. Thune\u00a0said not to worry:\u00a0there will be more hearings on this subject where some of these perspectives will be represented.</p><p>             PINGED: President Trump on Wednesday directly accused China of interfering in the U.S. midterm elections -- but did not offer any evidence to back up his claim,The Washington Post's David Nakamura and Ellen Nakashima reported. \"The president made the allegation during his opening remarks at a U.N. Security Council meeting on nonproliferation, asserting that ... 'They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade, and we are winning on trade - we are winning on every level.' \"</p><p>             The Chinese government pushed back on the accusation. \"We did not and will not interfere in any countries' domestic affairs,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the U.N. meeting. Trump defended the allegations later on Wednesday during a news conference.\u00a0\"We have evidence. It will come out. I can't tell you now... They've actually admitted that they've gone after farmers,\" Trump said, as quoted by my colleagues.          </p><p>Yet Trump's\u00a0top national security advisers, as David and Ellen reported, \"told reporters in August they had not found specific examples of interference ahead of the midterms from countries other than Russia, though they warned it remained a possibility. In his remarks at the Security Council meeting, Trump made no mention of Russian interference, though he did say later that his administration also will not let Moscow interfere in the elections....\u00a0Trump's remarks appear consistent with a White House strategy, devised in the immediate aftermath of his Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to spread blame for election interference beyond Russia.\"          </p><p>             PATCHED: The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday advanced a bill that would establish a Federal Acquisition Security Council to help identify potential supply-chain threats when the federal government purchases IT equipment.\u00a0Speaking in support of the bill, Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), the committee's ranking Democrat, said security concerns about the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab\u00a0amounted to a \"wake-up call\" for the federal government.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security last year directed\u00a0federal agencies of the executive branch\u00a0to rid their systems of\u00a0Kaspersky\u00a0products.\u00a0Congress later banned federal agencies from using services and products from the company;\u00a0the ban is scheduled to\u00a0go into effect on Oct. 1.\u00a0\"This bill will put in place a systemic way for federal agencies to make sure\u00a0national security interests are considered during the federal contracting process,\" McCaskill said. She\u00a0introduced the bill, called the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, alongside Sen. James Lankford\u00a0(R-Okla.) in June.</p><p>             The panel adopted several other pieces of\u00a0cybersecurity legislation on Wednesday, including a bill sponsored by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the committee's chairman, that\u00a0\"would give agencies authority to block websites if there's a pressing cybersecurity need,\"Nextgov's\u00a0Joseph Marks reported. Under the bill, called the Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act of 2018, federal agencies could\u00a0\"override union objections to block employees from using personal email accounts or Facebook on work computers,\" Marks reported.</p><p>             PWNED: Christine Blasey Ford, a professor in California who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were both teenagers, plans to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee today that her email was hacked after her identity became public.\u00a0\"This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault,\" Ford plans to tell the committee, according to her prepared opening remarks. Ford also plans to say that she has received death threats and been harassed.\u00a0\"People have posted my personal information on the Internet,\" Ford intends to tell senators. \"This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats.\"</p><p>             - \"Legislation introduced in the House Wednesday would create a stronger federal chief information officer and establishes a chain of command for some of the administration's most important IT officials,\"Nextgov's\u00a0Frank Konkel reported. \"The Federal CIO Authorization Act of 2018 would make the federal CIO a presidential appointee who would report directly to the Office of Management and Budget director. Currently the federal CIO reports to OMB's deputy director for management.\" The bill was introduced by Reps. Will Hurd\u00a0(R-Tex.) and Robin L. Kelly (D-Ill.).</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - \"Researchers at Cisco's Talos have discovered that VPNfilter - the malware that prompted Federal Bureau of Investigation officials to urge people to reboot their Internet routers - carried an even bigger punch than had previously been discovered,\"Ars Technica's Sean Gallagher reported Wednesday. \"While researchers already found that the malware had been built with multiple types of attack modules that could be deployed to infected routers, further research uncovered seven additional modules that could have been used to exploit the networks routers were attached to, thus stealing data and creating a covert network for command and control over future attacks. The malware appeared to be primarily intended to attack Ukraine on the anniversary of the NotPetya attack, but VPNfilter was clearly built for long-term use as a network exploitation and attack platform.\"</p><p>             - \"Uber has agreed to pay $148 million to settle allegations from 50 states and the District that the ride-hailing company violated data breach laws when it waited a year to disclose a hack affecting tens of millions of its riders and drivers,\"The Post's Brian Fung reported on Wednesday. \"The settlement is among the biggest in Uber's history and marks the first time the company has settled a matter with the top law enforcement officials from all 50 states and the District. It is the largest multistate penalty ever levied by state authorities for a data breach.\"</p><p>Moreover, Uber had paid $100,000 to the hackers to stay quiet about the breach that exposed names, email addresses and phone numbers of 57 million people around the world, Brian reported. The company will have to enact several changes as part of the settlement.\u00a0\"Uber agreed to undergo regular third-party audits of its security practices and to set up a program allowing employees to file concerns about ethics violations they may have witnessed while on the job,\" Brian wrote. \"It also agreed to take precautions to safeguard any Uber data that may be held by third parties, according to New York's attorney general's office.\"</p><p>             - \"The Port of San Diego said Wednesday it is investigating a highly sophisticated cybersecurity threat to its technology systems that is currently affecting the public agency's ability to process park permits and records requests, and perform other business services,\"the San Diego Union-Tribune's\u00a0Jennifer Van Grove and Gary Robbins reported.\u00a0\"The digital assault is similar, in some ways, to a ransomware attack that was launched against the city of Atlanta in March, security analysts say.\"</p><p>             - \"European Union lawmakers appear set this month to demand audits of Facebook by Europe's cybersecurity agency and data protection authority in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal,\"the Associated Press reports. \"A draft resolution submitted Thursday to the EU Parliament's civil liberties and justice committee urged Facebook to accept 'a full and independent audit of its platform investigating data protection and security of personal data.' \"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from abroad:          </p><p>             Today          </p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>Trump says he prefers to \"keep\"\u00a0 Rosenstein:</p><p>Michael Caputo loses temper on CNN panel:</p><p>Injured turtle fitted with custom wheelchair:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-40f62f0b3c784c009f9826ff50ca981b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-SRH1-JB4M-V34C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2376\"/><timeReceived>11:52 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) tweeted.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. Mark Warner\u00a0(Va.) and Ed Markey (Mass.) also pressed for tougher data security laws, and said Congress needs to set limits on how much customer data U.S. companies are allowed to store. Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) went even further - he said\u00a0senior executives who ignore customer data privacy should face jail time.</p><p>             After\u00a0potentially one of the largest breaches of consumer data in history, lawmakers appear ready to take a page out of Europe's playbook to ensure it does not happen again: Their calls for aggressive penalties for companies that have poor data security are reminiscent of the General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in the European Union earlier this year. The GDPR requires companies to adhere to a highly specific set of security requirements - and contains fines up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue for violations.\u00a0It is unclear, however, how such legislation would fare in a split Congress that appears poised for gridlock.\u00a0</p><p>             Wyden outlined on Twitter specific legislation\u00a0that would impose \"harsh fines and prison terms\" for companies that misuse consumer data. The bill, which a spokesman said he is preparing to introduce early next year, would set up a new office with the Federal Trade Commission called the Bureau of Technology, give it sweeping powers to punish businesses for lax data security practices, and require it to hire 175 staffers to \"police the largely unregulated market for private data.\"</p><p>             The bill would also introduce a new set of data security requirements, set up a \"do not track\" list for individual consumers to opt out of data collection online, and outlines \"steep fines (up to 4 percent of annual revenue), on the first offense for companies and 10-20 year criminal penalties for senior executives,\" according to a release from Wyden's office.\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren also said there should be consequences for executives, tweeting, \"CEOs won't take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line.\"\u00a0</p><p>To address the current crisis, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that Marriott that should pay for new passports for customers whose passport numbers were stolen.</p><p>Marriott, for its part, seemed to admit a degree of culpability for the breach of its Starwood reservation system containing addresses, travel locations, credit card numbers, phone numbers, passport numbers. The breach could possibly leave droves of customers vulnerable to espionage or identity theft.</p><p>\"We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of ourselves,\" Marriott president and chief executive Arne Sorenson said in a release. \"We are doing everything we can to support our guests, and using lessons learned to be better moving forward.\"</p><p>             But this apology was not sufficient for lawmakers, who insisted that businesses like Marriott can no longer be trusted to police themselves when it comes to data security.          </p><p>\"It seems like every other day we learn about a new mega-breach affecting the personal data of millions of Americans,\" Warner said in a statement. \"Rather than accepting this trend as normal, this latest incident should strengthen Congress' resolve.\"</p><p>\"If history is any guide, Marriott's mega data breach will be treated like all the others: the company will apologize and offer useless credit monitoring to the victims impacted,\" Wyden tweeted. \"The status quo isn't working.\" There have been several major breaches in the last several years that put hundreds of millions of customers' personal information at risk: The breaches of Target and Yahoo in 2013; Home Depot in 2014; the health insurer Anthem in 2015; and credit reporting company Equifax last year.</p><p>But as of now, U.S. companies rarely face fines for breaches.\u00a0The last major U.S. corporate cybersecurity overhaul was the 2014 Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, which led to a voluntary set of standards managed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). That law doesn't include fines for violations or data breaches.</p><p>Ron Gula, a cybersecurity investor who founded Maryland-based cybersecurity company Tenable Network Security, said Warner and Markey's idea that setting limits on personal information that companies can store would not be realistic for companies like Marriott, though he noted penalties might help improve their attitudes toward security.\u00a0</p><p>\"When you book a Marriott hotel room it's kind of nice that they already have all of your information when you book a room ... they are always going to have to collect sensitive data on their customers,\" Gula said. \"So the only other option is to increase their cybersecurity. The only other thing you can do is just increase penalties.\"</p><p>Others were skeptical that penalties would do anything to address the broader issue. As soon as there's a security mandate, some experts worried companies would focus on meeting the bare minimum that's required of them to avoid the fine.\u00a0          </p><p>Businesses \"must demonstrate that they are investing in security, not just to meet the minimum threshold of what the law requires - but that protecting their customers is a pillar of their business,\" Ellison Anne Williams, a former NSA technologist who is chief executive of a Maryland-based encryption company called EnVeil, told me in an email.</p><p>             Sign Up!

The case was brought by one such company, Six4Three, which claims its business was destroyed in 2015 by Facebook's actions.\"</p><p>Many companies that relied on Facebook's data via an application programming interface, or API, folded after the tech giant\u00a0in 2014 \"announced it was restricting developers' access to the API, citing privacy concerns from users who complained that their data was being shared with outsiders without their knowledge,\" according to my colleagues. But Six4Three\u00a0is challenging's Facebook's explanation.\u00a0\"Six4Three alleges that privacy was not the reason Facebook shut down the API,\" Elizabeth and Craig wrote. \"The developer claims Facebook realized that it could use its data feed as leverage, to pressure businesses to buy advertising that would fuel the company's then-nascent mobile-ad business.\"</p><p>             PATCHED: Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) introduced a bill that would create a program at the State Department to share information on election\u00a0security with U.S. allies, according to a press release from Klobuchar's office. The bill, titled\u00a0\"Global Electoral Exchange Act,\" would authorize the department to award grants to American nonprofits that focus on election security in order to share information with similar groups in allied countries.\u00a0\"Our intelligence community continues to warn that our elections-and those of our allies-are a target for adversaries,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"This bipartisan legislation will allow the State Department to work with our allies abroad to share information, discuss best practices, and combat the growing threat of election interference to democracies around the world.\"</p><p>Moreover,\u00a0under the program, foreigners involved in administering elections would travel to the United States to study U.S. electoral procedures while American officials would have an opportunity to learn about other countries' election security efforts.\u00a0A similar bipartisan bill sponsored by Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) passed the House in a voice vote in September. \"The threats to our democratic electoral process and those of other democracies across the globe should not be taken lightly,\" Sullivan said in a statement.</p><p>             PWNED: A Saudi critic of the\u00a0authorities in Riyadh alleges in a lawsuit that the Israeli company NSO Group, which sells the Pegasus spyware, helped Saudi Arabia monitor his communications with Jamal Khashoggi, a\u00a0\u00a0journalist who was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October, the New York Times's\u00a0David D. Kirkpatrick reported.\u00a0\"The spyware allows its customers to secretly listen to calls, record keystrokes, read messages, and track internet history on a targeted phone,\" according to the Times.\u00a0\"It also enables customers to use a phone's microphone and camera as surveillance devices. Because of those sweepingly invasive capabilities, Israel classifies the spyware as a weapon. The company must obtain approval from the Defense Ministry for its sale to foreign governments.\"</p><p>             The Saudi opposition activist, Omar Abdulaziz, has asylum in Canada and lives in Montreal. Abdulaziz and Khashoggi, who was a contributing columnist for The Post, collaborated on dissidence projects, the Times reported.\u00a0\"The lawsuit was filed by an Israeli lawyer, Alaa Mahajna, in cooperation with Mazen Masri, a lecturer at the City University of London,\" Kirkpatrick wrote. \"The lawyers say in the court papers that they intend to argue that the resulting exposure of the collaboration between Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi 'contributed in a significant manner to the decision to murder Mr. Khashoggi.'\"          </p><p>             - The United States and China will start negotiations to enact\u00a0\"structural changes\" to their trade relations, according to a White House statement.\u00a0The talks will include topics such as \"forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection,\" as well as\u00a0\"cyber intrusions and cyber theft,\" the statement said.\u00a0\"Many analysts are skeptical that China will make fundamental changes to its state-led economic system in the 90-day talks,\" The Post's\u00a0David J. Lynch wrote.</p><p>             -\u00a0\"U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday of being a 'slow learner' who again tried to meddle in U.S. elections in November, adding that he had no trust in the Russian leader,\" Reuters's\u00a0Phil Stewart reported. According to Reuters, Mattis said that \"(Putin) tried again to muck around in our elections this last month. And we are seeing a continued effort along those lines.\"</p><p>             - \"The Office of Management and Budget, in partnership with the Department of Education and the CIO Council, is launching an educational program to train current federal employees without an IT background in cyber defense skills,\"FCW's\u00a0Chase Gunter reported.\u00a0\"The Federal Cybersecurity Reskilling Academy is 'the first of many of the reskilling efforts that the administration is exploring,' said Federal CIO Suzette Kent on a briefing with reporters.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0\"A proposal to codify and elevate the authority of the White House's top IT officer passed in the House on Friday,\" FedScoop's Carten Cordell reported. \"The Federal CIO Authorization Act of 2018 - sponsored by Reps. Will Hurd, R-Texas, and Robin Kelly, D-Ill. - aims to make the Federal CIO a presidentially appointed position that reports directly the Office of Management and Budget director, instead of the deputy director, as it currently does.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - \"Alex Younger, chief of the U.K.'s foreign spy agency MI6, named Russia as a major proponent of state-sponsored cyber and terrorist attacks and warned the Kremlin there is a cost attached to every attack,\"\u00a0Bloomberg News's\u00a0Kitty Donaldson reported. \"He told Russia not to underestimate Britain's 'determination'' and 'capabilities,'' after President Vladimir Putin sought to melt at least a layer of diplomatic frost at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina by praising Britain as an 'important partner.'''</p><p>- More cybersecurity\u00a0news from abroad:          </p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>Tributes pour in for George H.W.

Jerry Brown (D) on Thursday signed the California Consumer Privacy Act into law, setting tough new restrictions on how Facebook, Google and other tech giants handle Californians' personal data.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The legislation, which mirrors sweeping privacy rules adopted in the European Union\u00a0this year, could generate new momentum for privacy initiatives at the federal level as well as in other states. The Golden State has long exerted an outsize influence on national Internet policy, and the law is likely to amplify debate over how to regulate companies' use of personal data at a time when the issue has come to the fore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"California has always been a bellwether for where rest of the country is going on tech policy and tech legislation,\" said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a digital rights group. \"If the people there are saying, 'We demand more control, insight and transparency about how our data is collected and used,' that's a very important signal to the rest of the country.\"          </p><p>Under the new law, tech companies will be required to tell customers about the types of data they collect and disclose the advertisers and other third parties they share it with, as my colleague Tony Romm reports. It also allows people to opt out of having their data sold and empowers the state attorney general to fine companies if they fail to safeguard people's information.</p><p>The law doesn't take effect until 2020. In the meantime, lawmakers are expected to do a lot of fine-tuning, and they're all but certain to face aggressive lobbying from corporate opponents such as Facebook, AT&amp;T and others. By the time the state implements the law, it could look very different from the way it does today:</p><p>But the push to get it passed is already rekindling discussion among federal lawmakers about the possibility of crafting national privacy rules.\u00a0</p><p>             \"My hope is just that it will initiate a real conversation that gets us to adopting some principles by November,\" Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents part of Silicon Valley, told Tony.</p><p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) expressed skepticism about how much a gridlocked Congress could do, but noted that the public demand was strong. \"The concerns about privacy have increased,\" she told my colleague. \"As people have learned more about this, there's been greater appetite to have protections.\"</p><p>             Indeed, there have been some signs of movement on this front lately. Just last week, Axios reported that White House officials had met with industry groups to discuss what federal online data privacy regulations might look like. Privacy regulators from the Federal Trade Commission said recently they're planning a listening tour this fall to learn about how to address data collection mishaps and other digital challenges. There are also data privacy bills in Congress that are drawing bipartisan support, as I reported this month.</p><p>             And whether or not Congress takes action, other states are poised to follow in California's footsteps, experts said. That's what happened after California in 2003 passed the country's first law requiring companies to notify customers of data breaches. In the 15 years since, all 50 states have adopted similar measures, many of them modeled after the Golden State's.\u00a0</p><p>             \"Inaction at the federal level is in part a reason why California seems to be taking this step,\" Harley Geiger, director of public policy at the data security firm Rapid7, told me. \"There should be broad realization that if federal inertia persists, we could well see a situation on privacy and security in the states that we currently do with data breach notification.\"          </p><p>From Geoffrey A. Fowler, The Washington Post's technology columnist:\u00a0</p><p>             The manner in which California's law came to be sends a message in itself, underscoring how concerned the state's residents are about who gets to do what with their personal information in the age of Cambridge Analytica, targeted advertising and massive data breaches.\u00a0          </p><p>\"California is not only the home base for the largest data and tech companies in the world,\" O'Connor told me. \"It's also the place where the companies are the most familiar with the power and the potency of data as a business asset. And there's a fairly informed electorate about how data can be used and manipulated.\"</p><p>The effort started with a ballot initiative introduced by a Alastair Mactaggart, a wealthy real estate developer, that would have imposed even tougher restrictions on the tech industry, as Tony has reported. After the measure garnered more than 600,000 signatures - nearly double the amount needed to include it on state ballots in November - Mactaggart agreed to withdraw it if lawmakers passed a compromise bill ahead of a June 28 deadline for finalizing ballot propositions.\u00a0</p><p>In a mad dash, policymakers hammered out the bill and sent it to Brown's desk.</p><p>             PINGED: The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday approved a bill by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.)\u00a0that aims to\u00a0deter cyberattacks sponsored by foreign states. Yoho\u00a0told lawmakers during the committee's meeting that \"the United States urgently needs to upgrade its\u00a0cyber deterrence, but there are no procedures in current law for naming and shaming state-sponsored hackers and, or linking penalties\u00a0to their illicit conduct.\"</p><p>Under the bill, titled Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018, the president could label those engaging\u00a0in state-sponsored cyberattacks\u00a0against the United States as \"critical cyber threat actors.\" The bill also lists a variety of\u00a0punitive measures the United States could take in response, such as financial sanctions or preventing travel. In a statement following the bill's passage in committee, Yoho said China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are among those that \"have developed sophisticated capabilities\" to harm the United States' economy, infrastructure\u00a0and elections. \"It is vital that when these attacks happen, they are exposed, pulled out of the shadows, and punished accordingly,\" Yoho said in his statement.</p><p>             PATCHED: Some experts worry that the improved ability\u00a0of Microsoft's facial-recognition technology to recognize people of color could be used against immigrants given the company's work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\u00a0The Washington Post's Drew Harwell reports. Satya Nadella, the company's chief executive, said in a post\u00a0last week that Microsoft's work with ICE involves assisting the agency with \"mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads,\" Harwell reports.</p><p>             \"Today's facial-recognition systems more often misidentify people of color because of a long-running data problem: The massive sets of facial images they train on skew heavily toward white men,\" Harwell\u00a0writes. \"A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study this year of the face-recognition systems designed by Microsoft, IBM and the China-based Face++ found their accuracy in classifying a person's gender was 99 percent for light-skinned males and 70 percent for dark-skinned females.\"</p><p>David Robinson, a managing editor of Upturn, a think tank seeking to promote the ethical use of technology, told Harwell\u00a0that improving facial recognition is the bare minimum that\u00a0tech companies can do. Those businesses \"have to acknowledge their moral involvement in the downstream use of their technology,\" Robinson told Harwell. \"The impulse is that they're going to put a product out there and wash their hands of the consequences. That's unacceptable.\"</p><p>             PWNED: Gen. James M. Holmes, the head of Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base, said Thursday that the military intends to resort to artificial intelligence more in the future, Defense One's Marcus Weisgerber\u00a0reports. Holmes said the military is bound to increasingly rely on programs such as Project Maven, which aims to use artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, according to\u00a0Weisberger. \"The benefit of this will be: it will free up people to focus on thinking about what they see and what it means in the intelligence field and on passing that information to decision makers more timely because you're able to do it faster,\" Holmes said, as quoted by\u00a0Weisberger. \"That's a big part of our future and you'll continue to see that expanded, with Project Maven being one of the first steps in bringing learning machines and algorithms in to be able to allow people to focus on things that people do best and let the machine do that repetitive task.\"</p><p>             Holmes's comments follow Google's decision\u00a0not to renew its involvement in Project Maven when its contract with the Pentagon expires in March of next year, which\u00a0The Post's Harwell reported on June 1. Thousands of\u00a0employees at Google had asked\u00a0chief executive Sundar Pichai\u00a0in a letter that the company withdraw from the program, Harwell wrote. Pichai said in a blog post on June 7 that Google will not use artificial intelligence to develop weapons or for applications that would aim \"to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.\" He added that the company intends to\u00a0continue to partner\u00a0with\u00a0governments on \"cybersecurity, training, military recruitment, veterans' healthcare, and search and rescue.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news:          </p><p>             -\u00a0\"A U.S. official says the suspect in the shooting at a Maryland newspaper was identified using facial recognition technology,\"the Associated Press reported Thursday evening. \"The official said the man was identified with the technology after he had damaged his fingerprints in what investigators believe was an attempt to prevent them from quickly identifying him.\" Five people were killed and two were injured in a shooting yesterday at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., The Post's\u00a0Lynh Bui, Ovetta Wiggins and Tom Jackman\u00a0reported.</p><p>             - The National Security Agency said\u00a0it started \"deleting all call detail records (CDRs) acquired since 2015 under Title V of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\" last month. NSA analysts\u00a0noticed that the\u00a0agency was receiving some call detail records from telecom providers that it was not supposed to get, according to a statement\u00a0released on Thursday. The agency noted that those records do not include the\u00a0content of the calls.\u00a0\"Because it was infeasible to identify and isolate properly produced data, NSA concluded that it should not use any of the CDRs,\" the statement said. \"Consequently, NSA, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, decided that the appropriate course of action was to delete all CDRs.\" The agency added that it has fixed the \"root cause of the problem.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Huawei\u00a0didn't quite appreciate\u00a0lawmakers' concern that the Chinese telecom giant's\u00a0partnerships with American universities may be a \"significant threat to national identity.\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.)\u00a0expressed those worries in a June 19 letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0that was signed by\u00a024 other Republican and Democratic\u00a0lawmakers from both chambers. \"In response, Eric Xu, Huawei's rotating chairman, called Rubio and Banks 'closed-minded and ill-informed,' \"Reuters's Sijia\u00a0Jiang reported on Thursday. Huawei provided a transcript to Reuters of the\u00a0comments that Xu made\u00a0in\u00a0Shanghai, Jiang writes. \"It seems that their bodies are in the information age but their minds are still in the agrarian age,\" Xu said, as quoted by Jiang.</p><p>             - A former Equifax employee was charged with insider trading in connection with\u00a0the huge data breach that hit the company in 2017, according to a statement released\u00a0Thursday by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia. Judicial authorities alleged that Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, who was a software development manager, exploited information to make money once the breach was revealed. \"Bonthu allegedly took advantage of his position to profit while members of the public were unaware of the data breach at Equifax,\"\u00a0Byung J. \"BJay\" Pak, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, said in a statement. \"The integrity of the stock markets are jeopardized when greedy individuals who are entrusted with nonpublic information use the knowledge for their benefit.\"\u00a0Bonthu, 44, was the second person to be charged in a case of insider trading related to the Equifax data breach, according to the U.S. attorney's office.\u00a0Jun Ying, another former Equifax worker,\u00a0faced similar charges and pleaded not guilty in March, according to the\u00a0statement.</p><p>             - More cybersecurity\u00a0news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - A digital bank said it warned Ticketmaster UK about a security breach well before the ticketing service revealed the hack, the BBC reported on Thursday. \"The cause of the breach, which the BBC understands has affected up to 40,000 UK users, appears to be a customer-service chatbot employed by third-party Inbenta Technologies,\" the BBC wrote.</p><p>             CHAT ROOM          </p><p>             - President Trump again on Thursday expressed frustration with U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Here's what he said in a morning tweet:</p><p>His remarks sparked a day of discussion\u00a0on Twitter. From CNN's Abby D.

This is why the legislative branch narrowly failed to repeal the law in 2017 despite Republican promises to do so - and majorities in both chambers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than any other policy issue, the GOP lost control of the House in the midterms because of a pending lawsuit by Republican attorneys general that puts millions of people with preexisting medical conditions at risk of losing protections they received as a result of the 2010 law.</p><p>The popularity of other provisions, like letting young adults stay on their parents' health plans until they turn 26, explains why GOP leaders on Capitol Hill are so anxious and angry that President Trump has picked a fresh - and they say futile - fight to replace the law.</p><p>Rolling back entitlements once they're expanded is politically perilous because there are always oodles of humanizing stories about individuals who would suffer, and people who stand to lose what they've grown accustomed to care more about protecting their benefits than critics who don't want their tax dollars to pay for them.</p><p>This was true after Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security, Lyndon Johnson established Medicare and, now it seems, after Barack Obama expanded Medicaid. Republicans initially campaigned on overturning the New Deal and the Great Society. They relented only after public opinion hardened against doing so. This week we're seeing how that's starting to happen with Obamacare.</p><p>Ignoring the advice of Vice President Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the president ordered the Justice Department this week to ask an appellate court to fully invalidate the Affordable Care Act as part of the lawsuit brought by Republicans in the states. Trump is now pressing GOP senators to come up with a replacement plan, something few have any appetite for.</p><p>             -- Two rulings issued last night by the federal district court in D.C. illustrate the human dynamics that make it so incredibly difficult to cut holes in the safety net. Judge James Boasberg threw sand in the gears of the Trump administration's campaign to compel poor people who depend on Medicaid to hold jobs in exchange for health benefits. For the second time, he rejected Kentucky's work requirement program and declared the rules that recently took effect in Arkansas \"cannot stand.\"</p><p>Boasberg, an Obama appointee, said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar behaved in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner when he signed off on the plans without considering the human impact and the intent of Congress when it established Medicaid. While his rulings technically apply only to the two states, they could also impact six other states that have received permission from the Trump administration to begin work requirements and seven other states that have applications pending.</p><p>             The judge opened his 35-page Arkansas decision with an anecdote about one of the approximately 18,000 people who were denied coverage between September and December for failing to comply with the state's new requirements.          </p><p>\"Adrian McGonigal is 40 years old and lives with his brother in Pea Ridge, Arkansas,\" Boasberg wrote. \"He used to have a job working in the shipping department of Southwest Poultry, a food-service company located nearby, although he received no medical insurance through his employer. Like many Americans, he has several serious medical conditions. Beginning in 2014, McGonigal was able to receive medical care - including regular doctor visits and numerous prescription drugs - through the state's expanded Medicaid program. In mid-2018, however, McGonigal learned that he would be subject to new work requirements. ...</p><p>\"Despite his lack of access to, and difficulty working with, computers, he was able to report his employment in June 2018, but he did not know he needed to continue to do so each month. As a result, when he went to pick up his prescriptions in October, the pharmacist told him that he was no longer covered, and his medicines would cost him $800. In the absence of Medicaid, he could not afford the cost of the prescriptions and so did not pick them up. His health conditions then flared up, causing him to miss several days of work, and Southwest Poultry fired him for his absences. He thus lost his Medicaid coverage and his job.\"</p><p>             -- My colleague Amy Goldstein, coincidentally, published a powerful piece yesterday morning from the small town of Marianna, Ark., about how hard it is for poor people in a job-starved region to comply with rules that may sound easy to you but turn out to be quite onerous: \"Computers are so scarce that even the public library has a sign out front saying it does 'not offer the Internet' - a problem for the work requirement's first several months, when people could not yet phone in their monthly reports.\" Amy's story includes these two particularly evocative examples:</p><p>\"Elizabeth Cloinger, 47, who lives in a trailer next to her cousin's house just outside town, thought she was complying with the new rules. She has been on Medicaid for years and already had a job, working seven days most weeks as a home health aide. Her wages - 9.25 an hour, with 50 cents more for hospice patients - and her hours met the new rules. Yet she received a June letter saying she needed to verify that her income made her eligible, or she would be cut off.</p><p>\"She called the listed phone number and faxed information to a state employee in Pine Bluff. She was told that, like many people, she was exempt from the work requirements - in her case, because she was caring for her 20-year-old daughter recovering from a car accident and her 3-year-old granddaughter. But on Aug. 18, she received another letter, saying she had been terminated because she had not verified her income. In December, four letters arrived saying she needed to update her email address, then 11 more in January. Each letter told her to create an online account. She doesn't have a computer and didn't realize that the program requires everyone to get an email address.</p><p>\"In all these months, Cloinger hasn't seen a doctor for the swelling in her right foot, which makes it hard to stand for long. Nor has she addressed the throbbing around the scar from her hysterectomy two years ago. 'I won't go' to the doctor, she said, having just finally paid off - in $10 monthly installments - a hospital bill for the X-rays she needed for a torn tendon before she got onto Medicaid. 'I am just putting it in God's hands,' Cloinger said. 'He is going to let me stay on this Earth to see my grandbaby be raised.'\"</p><p>             Conisha Gatewood, 31, also got caught up in the confusion. She was referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist for nonstop menstrual bleeding caused by ovarian cysts: \"But when she arrived for a September checkup, she was told she no longer had insurance. 'I was like: 'Yes, I do. They sent me the papers in June.''' She thought she had done everything right, creating a password and an online account. The state had used an automated system to fill in her child-care job and work hours. A letter from the state confirmed that, she thought, telling her she did not need to search for a job because she already worked. But then another letter came, telling her she needed to do a job search after all. 'I was so confused,' Gatewood said. 'I already had a job. No one could tell me what I needed to do.'</p><p>\"By the time she was cut off, she had found a better-paying position, selling cellphones inside a Walmart. In January, she reapplied to Arkansas Works - and was rejected because her December phone sales, high for the holidays, put her just over the income limit. She should go to her doctor this month, but she hasn't made an appointment. She has also stopped filling prescriptions, including for the birth control pills that correct her bleeding.\"</p><p>             -- Back to health care writ large: \"The White House has no proposal in the works, according to administration officials, but Trump wants Republicans to pass a bill before his reelection effort that would do what Obamacare does - provide coverage to millions of Americans,\" Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. \"Trump spoke with Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) on Tuesday evening and listed his priorities in a phone call with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) on Wednesday morning. ... White House aides said they are looking at a Barrasso plan that pushes short-term, limited-duration health insurance ... Also in the mix is legislation from Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that would provide block grants to states to provide coverage.\"</p><p>             -- In conversations with his members, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has also argued for the party to move on. His former chief of staff tweeted this:</p><p>             -- Mick Mulvaney is pulling the strings and pushed Trump to pick this fight.From Dawsey, Ashley Parker and Damian Paletta: \"His pitch came during scheduled 'policy time' with Trump on Monday and spanned several meetings throughout the day. It was met with resistance from some on the president's legal team and his Justice Department, as well as with skepticism from [Pence] ... The behind-the-scenes role played by Mulvaney - who in Congress was a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus and earned a reputation for frustrating Republican leadership - highlights the way he has operated as a top aide to Trump, first as budget director and now as acting chief of staff.\"</p><p>             GET SMART FAST:  </p><p>             BIG TECH:          </p><p>             -- The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced this morning that it is charging Facebook with housing discrimination, alleging its targeted advertising platform violates the Fair Housing Act by \"encouraging, enabling, and causing\" unlawful discrimination by restricting who can view housing ads.Tracy Jan reports: \"The charges caught Facebook off guard, coming one week after the social media giant agreed in a sweeping settlement with civil rights groups to overhaul its microtargeting ad system for job, housing and loan advertisements after discrimination complaints. 'We're surprised by HUD's decision, as we've been working with them to address their concerns and have taken significant steps to prevent ads discrimination,' said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. He said a breakdown occurred when the government requested total and unfettered access to the company's user base, a request Facebook denied because it would have set a dangerous precedent.\"</p><p>             -- Facebook announced it will begin blocking white-nationalist and white-separatist posts, photos and other content in response to criticism that a loophole on the platform allowed racism. Previously, the site only prohibited users from sharing messages that glorified white supremacy, but civil rights advocates argued that wasn't enough. (Tony Romm and Elizabeth Dwoskin)</p><p>             -- Twitter won't remove the president's tweets that violate the platform's rules. But it will begin to label them.Faiz Siddiqui reports          : \"The next time a politician, dignitary - or perhaps a president - makes an utterance that violates Twitter standards, the message might be accompanied by a note that expands on the 280-character tweet, a top official with the company said Wednesday. Twitter is exploring how it can annotate offensive tweets that break its rules but remain in the public interest, said Vijaya Gadde, the company's head of legal, policy, and trust and safety. ... 'One of the things we're working really closely on with our product and engineering folks is, 'How can we label that?'' Gadde\u00a0said. 'How can we put some context around it so people are aware that that content is actually a violation of our rules and it is serving a particular purpose in remaining on the platform.'\"       </p><p>             -- Google's CEO met with the president yesterday:          </p><p>             -- The British government released a scathing assessment of the security risks posed by the Chinese telecom company Huawei to Britain's telecom networks, as London weighs whether to heed U.S. calls to bar the firm from the next-generation 5G network over fears it will enable spying by the Chinese government and potential cyberattacks. Ellen Nakashima reports: \"This is the second consecutive year the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ - the British spy agency equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency - has identified serious problems. This year, officials said they have found 'further significant technical issues' in the firm's engineering processes, as well as continued 'concerning issues' in Huawei software, 'leading to new risks' in Britain's 4G telecom networks. Most ominously, the spy agency, which oversees a center that vets Huawei hardware and software for bugs and security vulnerabilities, said it can provide 'only limited assurance' that the long-term national security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment deployed in Britain, and that 'it will be difficult' to manage the risk of future products until the current defects are fixed.\"</p><p>             -- A Chinese gaming company is seeking to sell Grindr, a popular gay dating app, after U.S. officials raised security concerns about its ownership.\u00a0The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States told the company,\u00a0Beijing Kunlun Tech, that its ownership of the California-based app\u00a0constitutes a national security risk. (Reuters)</p><p>             -- Two former top CIA officials\u00a0compiled an unclassified report on the major national security challenges facing the United States and are offering it to every candidate running for president so they can counteract \"fake news\" and foreign election interference.Shane Harris reports: \"The report, which former acting CIA directors Michael Morell and John McLaughlin call a 'briefing book,'\u00a0is modeled on the classified oral briefing that the intelligence community provides to the nominees of each major political party running for president, usually after the nominating conventions. The former officials said they're distributing their briefing now, more than a year before nominees are selected, in response to 'the recent rise and abundance of fake news and foreign election interference,' according to a copy reviewed by The Post.\"</p><p>             THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:          </p><p>             -- Attorney General William Barr will almost certainly miss the deadline set by House Democrats for handing over special counsel Bob Mueller's full report.Karoun Demirjian reports: \"Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that during a Wednesday phone call with Barr, the attorney general said it would be 'weeks, not months' before lawmakers can see the report, making it 'apparent that the department will not meet the April 2 deadline that we set' earlier this week. Barr would not promise that 'an unredacted full report with the underlying documents, evidence, would be provided to Congress and to the American people,' Nadler said. 'We're not happy about that, to put it mildly.' Though Nadler would not say whether lawmakers will issue a subpoena, he told reporters that April 2 was 'a hard deadline that we set and we mean it.'\"</p><p>             -- Trump told Sean Hannity that he hasn't ruled out pardoning Michael Flynn and other campaign aides.\u00a0Colby Itkowitz reports: \"Trump called into Hannity's show Wednesday night and talked for 45 minutes with the host. ...\u00a0Most of that time was spent denigrating the investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Trump's victory lap ... included bashing the FBI as 'dirty cops,' former FBI director James B. Comey as 'a terrible guy,'\u00a0and former CIA director John Brennan as a 'sick person.' Trump called Barr ... 'a great gentleman'\u00a0and said 'had he been there initially, this all wouldn't have happened.'\"\u00a0The president also repeated the demonstrably false statement that Russia preferred Hillary Clinton over him in 2016.</p><p>             -- Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano, a stalwart Trump ally, warned viewers that the still-confidential Mueller report might contain evidence pointing to conspiracy and obstruction.The Daily Beast's Justin Baragona reports: \"'We saw on Sunday a four-page summary of a 700-page report,' the Fox analyst said. 'The 700-page report is a summary of two million pages of documents, of raw evidence.' ... 'In the 700-page summary of the two million pages of raw evidence, there is undoubtedly some evidence of a conspiracy and some evidence of obstruction of justice, just not enough evidence.' ... Napolitano went on to note that if 'there were no evidence of conspiracy and no evidence of obstruction, the attorney general would have told us so,' adding that Barr didn't, so 'there is something there' that Democrats and Trump opponents want to see. And they'll have a 'field day' with it.\"</p><p>             -- Meanwhile, a grand jury that worked with Mueller is still impaneled and working on related matters, including an ongoing investigation of a foreign state-owned mystery company that refused to comply with a subpoena from Mueller.Spencer Hsu reports: \"Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington on Wednesday held the first public hearing involving the secret subpoena fight by the foreign company since it rebuffed a grand jury request last July for documents. Howell asked David Goodhand, senior counsel to U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District, whether the grand jury impaneled by Mueller remained active. Subpoenas and contempt proceedings related to a grand jury expire when a grand jury ends.\u00a0'It's continuing robustly,' Goodhand said.\"</p><p>             The hearing was held to consider a request by the Reporters Committee for\u00a0Freedom of the Press to unseal materials related to the case, including the identity of the mystery company:\u00a0\"Howell said she would issue an order granting a 'huge chunk' of the Reporters Committee's request to make records public after she gave each side at least one month to confer about potential redactions to the sealed court motions and hearing transcripts in the case.\"</p><p>             -- House Democrats are seeking access to 10 years of Trump's financial records after Michael Cohen claimed the president had inflated his net worth.David A. Fahrenthold and Colby Itkowitz report: \"Last week, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) sent a letter to Victor Wahba, the chairman and chief executive of the audit firm MazarsUSA, asking for copies of 'statements of financial condition' and audits prepared for Trump and several of his companies ... The news ... leaked after top Republicans on the panel sent a letter to Wahba Wednesday expressing their displeasure over Cummings's request and his lack of consultation with them before making it.\"</p><p>             -- Cohen testified that Trump submitted a false insurance claim regarding a fresco on the ceiling of Melania Trump's bathroom in Trump Tower.\u00a0Jacqueline Alemany reports: \"Lawmakers are looking into Cohen's claim, which would be the first example of insurance fraud that has surfaced following his public testimony that Trump often exaggerated his personal wealth in financial documents provided to banks and insurers.\" The White House responded by saying \"no one should believe a word\" Cohen says.</p><p>             -- The special counsel's office interviewed Russian agent Maria Butina, but we still don't know what she said because the report remains confidential. Butina, who's been in jail since her arrest last year, spoke to Mueller's investigators\u00a0for about an hour. They were interested in her interactions with J.D. Gordon, a former national security aide on the Trump campaign, per\u00a0CNN.</p><p>             THE POLITICAL FALLOUT:          </p><p>             -- Trump will visit Grand Rapids, Mich., tonight for his first campaign rally since Mueller submitted a report that has only inflamed passions on both sides of the political divide.Greg Jaffe and Jenna Johnson report: \"Karen Dunnam, 62, will be taking part in a protest that she helped organize. She will be demonstrating against Trump but also the 'Magahats,' which she pronounces 'maggots,' who have come to support him. ... Inside the arena, which is likely to be packed with more than 12,000 people, Liz Johnson, a law student and mother of three boys, will be volunteering on behalf of her president. She wonders about the damage done by the long investigation and why it couldn't have been completed sooner. ... Many Republicans, like Johnson, said that the report proved definitively that Trump was the victim of a baseless two-year vendetta brought on by a deep-state Washington establishment that he had vowed to dethrone. Many Democrats, like Dunnam, said the real truth about Trump was buried somewhere in the unreleased details of Mueller's report.\"</p><p>             -- A majority of Americans say Barr's letter did not exonerate Trump of collusion, according to a new CNN-SSRS poll.CNN's Jennifer Agiesta reports: \"A majority (56%) says the President and his campaign have not been exonerated of collusion, but that what they've heard or read about the report shows collusion could not be proven. Fewer, 43%, say Trump and his team have been exonerated of collusion. ... Republicans and Democrats are on opposite sides of this question: 77% of Republicans say the President has been exonerated, 80% of Democrats say he has not. Independents break against exoneration -- 58% say the President and his campaign were not exonerated. ... Nearly 6 in 10 Americans want to see Congress continue to pursue hearings into the findings of Mueller's report.\"</p><p>             -- According to a CBS poll, 3 in 4 Americans -\u00a0including majorities of both Republicans and Democrats -\u00a0want the full report released to the public.          </p><p>             -- An NBC News\u00a0poll out this morning shows\u00a0Americans split over who would win if the 2020 election were today: Forty-three percent think Trump would prevail, the same percentage of people who think\u00a0the Democrat would win.</p><p>             -- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is considering a primary challenge against Trump, said he is still \"anxiously waiting\" to see more details from Mueller's report. But Hogan acknowledged that Barr's summary of Mueller's findings was \"good news\" for Trump that does not make the president more vulnerable to a primary upset next year.

May offered no timetable for her possible departure. Some Tory lawmakers said a leadership election within the party could happen over the summer, with May leaving 10 Downing Street by the autumn. ... While May's offer to step aside encouraged a number of Conservative rebels to say they now will support her twice-defeated Brext deal, she still may not have enough votes for the deal to pass this divided Parliament. Crashing out of the European Union without a deal as well as a long delay, a general election or a second referendum all remain options as the chaos of Brexit continues.\"</p><p>             -- The British environment secretary Michael Gove and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson are considered two front-runners to replace May.Karla Adam reports: \"Gove, a prominent Brexiteer and one of the Conservative Party's more cerebral figures, played a key role in the 2016 Vote Leave campaign. He has been loyal to May since returning to the cabinet, but his reputation took a hit after he was accused of betraying Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest. ... Johnson is that rare politician who has cross-party appeal. He served two terms as the mayor of London - an impressive feat in a city that typically votes Labour. But his popularity began to slump after the 2016 European Union referendum, especially in pro-E.U. cities such as London, and he received mixed reviews for his time as foreign secretary.\"</p><p>             -- While testifying on Capitol Hill, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo deflected questions about whether Kim Jong Un bears responsibility for North Korea's human rights abuses. When asked whether Kim was responsible for his country's labor camps, Pompeo repeatedly said, \"He's the leader of the country.\" In response to a question about Otto Warmbier, Pompeo chose to blame \"the North Korean regime\" for the American student's death rather than Kim himself.

Peter Elms, the assistant general manager of Immigration New Zealand, said in a statement that there were 6,457 registrations after the shooting, and 4,844 in the 10 days before.

While Trump has thrown his support behind Guaid\u00f3, Russia and China remain loyal to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u00a0From Al Jazeera: \"The US government says the Russian troops include special forces and cybersecurity personnel. 'They've got a lot of pressure right now. They have no money, they have no oil, they have no nothing. They've got plenty of pressure right now. They have no electricity,' Trump said.

But as word spread following Tuesday's hearing, attacks poured in from Capitol Hill, the presidential campaign trail and Twitter. DeVos defended the proposal, saying Special Olympics benefits from private philanthropic support. ... That did little to calm the storm. ... The proposal appeared dead again this year. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the top Republican on the Senate panel that oversees appropriations for the Education Department, said in a statement that his chamber's bill will not cut the funding.\" The cost of five of the president's trips to Mar-a-Lago would cover DeVos's proposed cuts to the Special Olympics, Philip Bump notes.</p><p>             -- The commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection warned that the country has hit a \"breaking point\" at the border amid a surge of immigrants.Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti report: \"Kevin McAleenan ... said that for the first time in more than a decade, his agency is 'reluctantly' performing direct releases of migrants, meaning they are not turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they are not detained, they are not given ankle bracelets to track their movements and they are allowed to leave with just a notice to appear in court at a later date. He said that this is a 'negative outcome' but that it is 'the only current option we have' because of overcrowding at detention facilities as Central Americans stream to the border knowing they will be able to gain entry with asylum claims.\"</p><p>             -- Not much is behind many of the executive orders that the president signs with much fanfare.The Los Angeles Times's Noah Bierman reports: \"For a president who relishes pomp and shows of executive action, unchecked by Congress, signing ceremonies have become a hallmark, a way to convey accomplishment for a man who asserts he has done more than any president in history. The Times reviewed 101 executive orders Trump has signed since inauguration day, and interviewed experts, advocates and administration officials about their effects. Many were geared toward favored political constituencies, including veterans, blue-collar workers and evangelical Christians. Few moved policy significantly; generally the orders created committees or task forces, demanded reports or pressed for enforcement of existing laws.\"</p><p>             -- Stephen Moore, Trump's nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve, owes more than $75,000 in taxes and other penalties.Bloomberg News's Christopher Condon and Joe Light report: \"A federal tax lien filed in the circuit court for Montgomery County, Maryland, where Moore owns a house, says that the government won a judgment against Moore for $75,328.80.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) promised to go to war against the NRA if elected president as he explained that\u00a0             gun violence is very personal to him.CNN's Gregory Krieg and Dan Merica report: \"I am tired of going to funerals where parents are burying their children,\" Booker said before referencing the death of Shahad Smith, a 28-year-old man killed in Newark. \"I live in Newark, and my mayor is doing a great job in lowering crime, but there are shootings ... Shahad Smith was killed with an assault rifle on my block last year, on the top of the block where I live.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Booker also expressed frustration at the way his Democratic rivals are debating reparations, saying the issue has been reduced to \"a box to check on a presidential list\": \"This is so much more of a serious conversation,\" he said. \"So do I support legislation that is race-conscious about balancing the economic scales? Not only do I support it, but I have legislation that actually does it.\" The senator then slammed \"horrible crime bills\" signed in the 1990s by some of his fellow 2020 candidates. The most notable was the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994 that former vice president Joe Biden wrote when he was a senator and that gained support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee when they were representatives.</p><p>             -- While Booker was mayor of Newark, the city's police force attracted numerous complaints of racial profiling.The New York Times's Nick Corasaniti and Stephanie Saul scrutinizes his record: Booker \"had swept into office in 2006 pledging a safer city through zero tolerance on crime. And while killings actually rose in his first year, over the next three they fell to historic lows. Yet grievances against the police were piling up in the city's black wards, with allegations of racial profiling, unlawful stops and excessive force. The A.C.L.U. and local activists pressed for reforms, complaining about pushback from Mr. Booker, whose administration was promoting the plunging homicide rate.\"</p><p>             -- As California's attorney general, Kamala Harris championed a war against truancy. Now some of the parents who\u00a0were caught up in it are speaking out against the Democratic senator. Cheree Peoples was arrested six years ago after her daughter, Shayla, repeatedly missed school because of complications caused by sickle cell anemia. Despite plenty of evidence given to Shayla's school about her illness, Peoples was still detained.\u00a0\"Peoples was caught up in the hugely complex forces Harris and her tough-on-truancy stance unleashed more than a decade ago,\" HuffPost's Molly Redden reports. \"Harris has since replaced her punitive stance with the message that parents of truant children need help, not scare tactics ... Peoples' arrest wasn't a freak occurrence --\u00a0it was the inevitable outcome of Harris' campaign to fuse the problem of truancy with the apparatus of law enforcement. ... There are still hundreds of families across California entering the criminal justice system under the aegis of Harris' law.\"</p><p>             -- Former Virginia governor\u00a0Terry McAuliffe (D) is inching closer to a 2020 presidential run.

She paid $29,170 in federal taxes. Ms. Gillibrand, who is currently at the bottom of the polls, recorded a video touting the disclosure of her taxes as a step toward political transparency.\"</p><p>             -- \"Many of the Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020 haven't been quick to disclose their own personal tax returns, saying it will take some time for the documents to be assembled or offering vague explanations for the delay,\"Holly Bailey notes.\u00a0Other than Gillibrand, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren has offered an extensive look at her tax records - posting filings on her campaign site dating back to 2008, when the then-Harvard Law professor was appointed to a congressional panel overseeing the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis. Warren, who prepares her own taxes, has yet to file her 2018 return but plans to make it public when she does, according to her campaign.\"</p><p>             -- Warren unveiled a plan to take on farm consolidation by demanding changes from the largest corporate agricultural firms, a proposal that could attract a lot of interest in Iowa.The Des Moines Register's Brianne Pfannenstiel and Kim Norvell report: Warren's plan \"would address consolidation in the agribusiness industry, 'un-rig' the rules she says favor its largest players, and elevate the interests of family farmers. ... The companies she names in her plan - Tyson, Dow-DuPont and Bayer-Monsanto - are some of the key players in Iowa's economy. ... Rural Iowa, in particular, has felt the effects of farm consolidation, which creates ripple effects through local economies. According to data for the U.S. Agriculture Census, Iowa lost 32,600 farms during a 30-year period that ended in 2012.\"</p><p>             -- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) proposed a trillion-dollar plan to rebuild infrastructure across the nation.\u00a0In a Medium post, Klobuchar's campaign presented the proposal as the senator's \"top budget priority\" if she were elected president. It will target, among other issues, the repair of roads, highways and bridges and the construction of protection against flooding, as well as the modernization of airports and seaports and the expansion of public transit options.</p><p>             -- \"Democrats' 2020 policy proposals almost certainly require middle class tax hikes,\"Jeff Stein notes.</p><p>             -- Former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams predicted a female or minority candidate would win the Democratic nomination. Abrams added later in an appearance on \"The View\" that she is \"open to all options,\" including a presidential bid. She also said that\u00a0although she has spoken to Biden, serving as his running mate \"was not the core issue.\" On the possibility that she would enter the 2020 field to get a vice-presidential nod, she said, \"I think you don't run for second place.\" (John Wagner)</p><p>             THE NEW CONGRESS:          </p><p>             -- In response to the Green New Deal, Nancy Pelosi unveiled a limited bill to combat climate change that would keep the United States in the Paris accord.Mike DeBonis reports: \"A day earlier, as some Democrats have embraced Medicare-for-all, Pelosi (D-Calif.) rolled out legislation to shore up the Affordable Care Act ... In both cases, the bills are much more in line with the centrist platforms of freshman lawmakers who unseated Republicans in dozens of suburban and rural districts that will be crucial to the party holding its majority in 2020.

By Wednesday afternoon the PAC devoted to increasing Hispanic elected officials launched a website trying to draft Luj\u00e1n into the Senate race ... Hispanic leaders have often felt that, when it comes to statewide office, particularly Senate races, that establishment Democrats often favored the 'electability' of a white candidate over a rising star Latino.\"</p><p>             -- Rep.

He flew in a private jet, lived in a mansion overlooking the Pacific and rang up six-figure receipts at Neiman Marcus and other sumptuous retailers.

As local newspapers disappear, citizens increasingly rely on national sources of political information, which emphasizes competition and conflict between the parties. Local newspapers, by contrast, serve as a central source of shared information, setting a common agenda. Readers of local newspapers feel more attached to their communities. Unless something is done, our politics will likely become ever more contentious and partisan as the media landscape consolidates and nationalizes.\"\u00a0</p><p>             DAYBOOK:          </p><p>             Trump will meet with the secretary of state before traveling to Grand Rapids, Mich., for a rally.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) quotes William Jennings Bryan's \"Cross of Gold\" speech as she channels the prairie populism that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 1896. \"Like Bryan, I will fight for farmers,\" she promises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) calls for a modern-day Granger movement, the coalition of Midwestern farmers that formed after the Civil War to challenge hefty fees being charged by monopolistic railroads to transport their grain to market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Literally this movement started when farmers were out there with their pitchforks ... and that's what we need to see today,\" Klobuchar told hundreds of farmers during a forum here in rural northwestern Iowa on Saturday afternoon. \"Our railroads ... are down to four, the same number as on the Monopoly board. We are entering what is essentially a new Gilded Age, and we need to take on the power of these monopolies. We're getting to the point where you know you're not going to be able to get a fair deal.\"</p><p>This riff drew the loudest cheers of the day during the Heartland Forum. Klobuchar was one of four Democratic presidential candidates, plus Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who fielded questions about issues facing rural America. About 150 farmers gathered for a separate rally earlier in the day to agitate for legislation that would put a moratorium on corporate mergers.</p><p>             -- Warren went even further than Klobuchar as she called for breaking up Big Ag. She promised to try unwinding some megamergers that have already been approved if she's elected, including the $66 billion Bayer-Monsanto deal, which combined two major seed suppliers. Government statistics show four companies control 85 percent of the U.S. corn seed market, up from 60 percent in 2000, and 75 percent of soybean seeds, up from about 50 percent.</p><p>\"Twenty years ago, 600 different outfits were selling seeds. Today, basically, it's six,\" Warren said. \"A generation ago, 37 cents out of every food dollar went into a farmer's pocket. Today, it's 15 cents. And one of the principal reasons for that has been concentration in agribusiness. You've got these giant corporations that are making bigger and bigger profits for themselves, for their executives and for their investors, but they're putting the squeeze on family farms. We've got to start fighting back against them.\"</p><p>             -- It's not just farmers who are suddenly fixated on corporate consolidations. This has quickly become one of the hottest topics on the campaign trail, surfacing in conversations across the country. M&amp;A is suddenly sexy off Wall Street and could play as prominent a role in 2020 as in any national election since 1912.</p><p>             Trustbusting has become the cleanest proxy for Democratic presidential aspirants to demonstrate their seriousness about taking on corporate power. Democrats point to data that suggests we're living in an era of monopolies, monopsonies and oligopolies not seen since the Gilded Age. They blame consolidation for stagnant wages, higher prices, lower product quality, income inequality and a host of other systemic problems afflicting the middle class.</p><p>             Agriculture is one of several large industries in which this year's bumper crop of Democratic candidates is calling for breaking up the biggest players or otherwise limiting their power, from technology and telecommunications to transportation, online travel, financial services, pharmaceuticals and, of course, health insurance companies. They all say that the Trump administration's most notable move in the antitrust space, unsuccessfully opposing the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, was more about trying to punish CNN for its coverage of the White House than actually trying to limit corporate power.</p><p>             -- Breaking up the big banks is a well-known pillar of Bernie Sanders's stump speech, but even when he's speaking to urban audiences, the senator from Vermont still takes time to decry the Bayer-Monsanto merger as bad for farmers and consumers. Sanders wasn't in Iowa this weekend, but he wrote an op-ed for Saturday's Des Moines Register promising to strengthen antitrust laws.          </p><p>\"When we are in the White House, we will reverse the Trump administration's elimination of President Obama's rule to let small farmers take legal action when they are abused by big corporate middlemen,\" Sanders wrote. \"The same goes for Trump's elimination of the agency inside the USDA that enforces antitrust laws in the meatpacking industry. ... We must end the absurd situation where the top four packing companies now control more than 80 percent of the beef market, 63 percent of the pork market, and 53 percent of the chicken market. We must help communities where there is a single buyer, meaning farmers are at the mercy of a corporation that's effectively forcing them to use only the company's feed and livestock.\"</p><p>             Bernie's lifelong political hero has been Eugene Debs, an Indiana union leader who spent six months behind bars in 1894 for organizing a strike that a conservative federal judge ruled was illegal. Pullman, a rail car manufacturer that essentially had a monopoly on production, slashed wages by 25 percent but refused to cut rents for workers living in houses in the company town outside Chicago. When Pullman employees went on strike, Debs announced that members of his rail worker union would refuse to do any work on Pullman coaches. This show of solidarity paralyzed the nation's transportation network. Debs's approach to organizing indelibly shaped the senator's worldview, as I documented in a January 2016 Big Idea. (Klobuchar also mentioned the Pullman strike during Saturday's forum.)</p><p>             -- History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. There are eerie, and undeniable, parallels between the Gilded Age and the present moment.</p><p>Bryan, known as the Boy Orator of the Platte, represented neighboring Nebraska in Congress. He advocated unsuccessfully for bimetallism, which would have created inflation that helped farmers at the expense of eastern moneyed\u00a0elites. Warren, an expert on bankruptcy as a Harvard Law professor and the bane of big banks as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is an Oklahoma native who similarly peppers her erudite speeches with folky aphorisms.</p><p>             -- Klobuchar is writing a full-length book on antitrust policy that she expects will come out in the next six months to a year, likely before the Iowa caucuses. \"It's almost done,\" she said in a half-hour interview after the forum here. \"I think it does help that a number of candidates are talking about it. Otherwise I'd be out there by myself.\"</p><p>             Speaking to the crowd, Klobuchar touted her role as the top Democrat on the Senate subcommittee that oversees antitrust and competition policy. She says it was mergers in the pharmaceuticals industry, which led to price hikes for insulin, that prompted her to realize we've entered a new Gilded Age. \"They have two lobbyists for every member of Congress, and nothing happens - including antitrust,\" she said of Big Pharma. \"You know the first state that had a comprehensive antitrust law? It was Iowa. Iowa did it in 1888, and now we know we have to do it on the federal level and improve some of the laws that we have now.\"</p><p>             -- Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), one of the three other Democrats who sit on the antitrust subcommittee, was one of the leading critics of Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and has sponsored far-reaching legislation to restrict mergers and acquisitions in the farming and food sectors. (The Washington Post is owned by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos.) Booker's bill, which was dead on arrival in a Republican-controlled Senate, was modeled on a proposal introduced 20 years ago by the late senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota populist folk hero who died in a 2002 plane crash.</p><p>\"A small number of giant companies control every link of our food chain,\" Booker said in a statement. (He skipped the Iowa cattle call to attend fundraisers before the first-quarter deadline.) \"Consolidation has now reached a point where the top four firms in almost every sector of the food and agriculture economy have acquired abusive levels of market power. As a result, the U.S. is losing farmers at an alarming rate, agricultural jobs and wages are drying up and rural communities are disappearing.\"</p><p>             -- Former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said that \"Sen. Warren has been fantastic on this\" when asked whether he'd block more mergers during the Storm Lake event. \"When we analyze antitrust, we have to think more about not just prices for consumers but all the people along the production chain,\" Castro said at the event.</p><p>             -- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has endorsed Warren's proposal to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon. She plans to introduce a bill in the House that would do so.</p><p>             -- The rising tide of populism is already having some impact. Tech giants are panicked about what the next administration will do to them. They're trying to avoid the pitchforks by asking to be regulated, understanding that it will probably be easier to water down both the rules and the enforcement, thanks to their armies of lobbyists, if they have seats at the table. And big companies with savvy strategists understand that they can actually shape regulations in ways that create compliance costs and erect barriers to entry for entrepreneurs looking to challenge them. There's a long history of this, and Mark Zuckerberg's op-ed in Sunday's Post reads like a classic of the genre.</p><p>             -- Even former congressman John Delaney (Md.), perhaps the biggest corporatist in the field of 15 Democratic candidates, called for updating antitrust laws on Saturday.At the forum, he declined to discuss breaking up specific companies but agreed that the growing number of mergers poses problems to society. \"All the big companies have effectively controlled the part of the agricultural market where there's no risk, and they leave the farmers in the one part of the market where there's risk,\" he said.</p><p>             -- Beto O'Rourke wasn't in Iowa on Saturday because he was holding a big rally in his hometown of El Paso. But he used that kickoff speech to promise that combating the concentration of wealth and power will be a centerpiece of his campaign. \"This extraordinary, unprecedented concentration of wealth and power and privilege must be broken apart, and opportunity must be shared with all,\" O'Rourke declared.</p><p>             -- Assuming Joe Biden still forges ahead with his plans to run for president after another rough week - from tone-deaf comments on Anita Hill to fresh scrutiny of his erratic record on abortion rights and topped off by Lucy Flores's allegations of unwanted touching - this issue will likely emerge as another liability on his left flank. The Obama administration had a spotty record on antitrust enforcement, something Klobuchar, Warren and Sanders each allude to when discussing this issue, and Obama White House officials were buddy-buddy with the big tech titans who have now become villains in the eyes of many Democratic activists. As a senator from Delaware, Biden was not just an ally of big business, Wall Street and credit card companies. Going back to the 1970s, he actually fought against strengthening antitrust laws.</p><p>             -- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is also viewed by rival campaigns as vulnerable on this issue. It's not just that she hasn't led on antitrust. She hasn't even staked out a position. Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, the author of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\" says Harris is \"the largest question mark\" among the major candidates. \"She has been silent on the questions raised by tech monopolies,\" Wu warned in a recent op-ed for the New York Times. \"Ms. Harris attracted some attention last month when she declined to register opposition to the proposed merger of the wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile - in stark contrast to the rest of the senators running for president. It may be that she is relatively open to approving mergers; it is also possible that her positions are just undeveloped.\"</p><p>A Harris spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>             -- Klobuchar told me that the growing competition among Democrats to toughen antitrust laws and enforcement reminds her of the 1912 election. \"It was a Republican president, Teddy Roosevelt, that pushed antitrust,\" she said. TR was incensed that his successor as president, William Howard Taft, wasn't pursuing his agenda, especially trustbusting. So he challenged Taft for the GOP nomination. After losing at the convention, he created the new Bull Moose Party to run as an independent and decry growing corporate power. Woodrow Wilson sought to pick off Roosevelt's progressive supporters by co-opting one of his core issues. \"Wilson actually had a campaign song about antitrust,\" said Klobuchar. \"You can look it up.\" Wilson won the three-way race. During his first term, he signed the Clayton Antitrust Act and created the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>             -- Warren, Klobuchar and Booker all suggest that their ultimate goal on antitrust is to save capitalism for future generations by limiting its excesses and maximizing competition in the marketplace. This sets them apart from someone like Sanders, who advocates for democratic socialism.</p><p>             Bob Leonard, the news director for the Iowa radio stations KNIA and KRLS, asked Klobuchar about vertical integration. \"In mid-2018, Walmart began bottling milk in a newly built facility near Fort Wayne, Indiana, for its 500 stores in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana,\" he lamented, citing a recent story from an agricultural trade publication. \"With this, Walmart has Walmart-contracted truckers, hauling Walmart-contracted milk to a Walmart bottling plant that Walmart will then process and haul to Walmart stores on Walmart trucks to sell directly to Walmart customers. Costco is doing the same for chickens. Milk and chickens are loss leaders for these chains. ... What specifically will you do to address this?\"</p><p>             Klobuchar said meaningful action will require changing the laws because the confirmations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh mean that the Supreme Court will likely be hostile to antitrust efforts for at least a generation. In the meantime, she said, it's important to put as much money into enforcement as possible. \"Think about the AT&amp;T breakup. That took years to get done. But what happened? We saw significant lowering of our long-distance rates,\" Klobuchar said. \"You have to be willing to put the resources into it. We now have several trillion-dollar companies. So you have to have people that are as sophisticated as those corporate tycoons to be able to take this on. You can't just think you're going to be able to do it with three lawyers in a room.\"</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas to obtain the full report of special counsel Bob Mueller.John Wagner reports: \"Rep.

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta's resignation this morning is another data point of how far society has come since the #MeToo movement began. But several stories this week have also laid bare some of the persisting systemic challenges in combating what advocates call rape culture. There are daily reminders of how much still has not changed both at home and abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             -- Acosta stepped down in the face of mounting scrutiny over his role in negotiating a 2008 deal with Jeffrey Epstein that allowed the financier to plead guilty to lesser offenses in a sex trafficking case. \"I don't think it's right or fair to have this administration's labor department have Epstein be the focus instead of the incredible economy we have today,\" Acosta said on the White House lawn. \"It would be selfish for me to stay in the position and continue talking about a case that is 12 years old.\"</p><p>             Standing at his side, Trump emphasized that the decision to resign was made by Acosta and that he was not fired. \"This was him, not me,\" the president said. \"I said to Alex, 'You don't have to do this.'\"</p><p>             -- Acosta tried to save his job with a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, but the reality turned out to be much more complicated than the version of events he outlined.Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett, Kimberly Kindy and Renae Merle reported last night: \"Current and former law enforcement officials expressed concerns about the number of unusual decisions made in Epstein's favor more than a decade ago. Court documents show that Acosta's office was amenable to the demands of Epstein's defense team even as it kept Epstein's alleged victims in the dark. And where Acosta would not bring a federal case, federal prosecutors in New York did - on the basis of at least some of the same allegations and evidence that Acosta was considering.</p><p>\"Acosta said during his news conference that his office intervened in the early 2000s to make sure Epstein would be jailed after a grand jury convened by the Palm Beach County state attorney recommended a single charge that would have resulted in no jail time and no requirement that Epstein register as a sex offender. Former Palm Beach County state attorney Barry Krischer disputed that version of events, saying Acosta's 'recollection of this matter is completely wrong.' ... And Acosta's characterization is somewhat undercut by internal Justice Department emails that became part of the public court record in subsequent lawsuits. Those messages show some coordination between federal prosecutors and the Palm Beach County state attorney. They also show a prosecutor in Acosta's office, A. Marie Villafana, acceding to demands from Epstein's attorneys not to inform alleged victims that the federal criminal investigation had been settled with a non-prosecution agreement.\"</p><p>             -- Meanwhile, at least a dozen new victims have come forward since the weekend to claim they were sexually abused by Epstein, according to the Miami Herald's Julie K. Brown and David Smiley, \"even as the multimillionaire money manager tries to convince a federal judge to allow him to await a sex trafficking trial from the comfort of the same $77 million Manhattan mansion where he's accused of luring teenage girls into unwanted sex acts. Following Epstein's arrest Saturday in New Jersey, four women have reached out to New York lawyer David Boies, and at least 10 other women have approached other lawyers who have represented dozens of Epstein's alleged victims in the past. Jack Scarola, a Palm Beach attorney, said at least five women, all of whom were minors at the time of their alleged encounters with Epstein, have reached out to either him or Fort Lauderdale lawyer Brad Edwards.\"</p><p>             -- One of the new accusers, Jennifer Araoz, spoke with Savannah Guthrie this morning on NBC's \"Today\" show.             She said she believes she was \"groomed\" for Epstein. \"I was a pretty happy child, but I had some pains growing up because my father had passed when I was 12 years old, so that definitely took an effect on me as a kid,\" Araoz said. \"It was [a process]. It wasn't an overnight thing and that's why I feel like it was really well thought out, well planned to really make me feel as comfortable as possible to almost keep me coming back. I didn't really think her and him would conspire to have me go there to do such weird things that ended up happening.\"</p><p>             -- Federal prosecutors are being more aggressive against others accused of sex crimes. For example, the R&amp;B singer R. Kelly was arrested last night in Chicago after a federal grand jury indicted him on 13 new counts, including enticement of a minor and obstruction of justice. This is in addition to the charges he's already facing from local authorities in Illinois. \"The 52-year-old Grammy winner, whose real name is Robert Kelly, was arrested in February on 10 counts in Illinois involving four women, three of whom were minors when the alleged abuse occurred. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and was released on bail,\" the AP notes. \"Then on May 30, Cook County prosecutors added 11 more sex-related counts involving one of the women who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was underage. ...</p><p>\"Kelly has faced mounting legal troubles this year after Lifetime aired a documentary 'Surviving R. Kelly,' which revisited allegations of sexual abuse of girls. The series followed the BBC's 'R Kelly: Sex, Girls &amp; Videotapes,' released in 2018, that alleged the singer was holding women against their will and running a 'sex cult.'

In this case, Pence's private political considerations cost the administration a chance to elevate a fresh conservative to the federal bench when Kanne, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, revoked his senior status upon learning that Fisher wouldn't be nominated to replace him.\"</p><p>             2020 WATCH:          </p><p>             -- What is Joe Biden trying to hide?Matt Viser reports: \"Biden's effort to make his lengthy experience the central issue of his campaign has been confounded by questions about his actions during almost four decades as a U.S. senator, on issues including criminal justice, busing and the hearings into the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Those questions might be answered in the massive trove of Senate records he donated eight years ago to the University of Delaware under an agreement that they could be made public by early this year. But the records are being kept secret, following new terms the university posted on its website just before Biden made his presidential campaign official in April. ...</p><p>\"The collection of documents that Biden donated to his alma mater fills 1,875 boxes and also includes 415 gigabytes of electronic records. It includes committee reports, drafts of legislation and correspondence. ... The documents also could showcase his foreign policy views, including the internal deliberations that led to his support for the Iraq War ... Biden has at times played down or misrepresented his record - saying last weekend, for example, that he did not support more funding for state prisons, even though in 1994 he argued for $6 billion in such funding.\"</p><p>             -- Biden used the first big foreign policy speech of his presidential run to blast Trump for embracing autocrats and to promise that his administration would make the defense of democracy a priority.Greg Jaffe and Cleve Wootson report: \"He accused Trump of 'walking away from American responsibility, lying about matters big and small' and bankrupting 'America's word.' Biden's alternative largely involved a return to traditional American principles such as the promotion of democracy and cooperation with allies. Instead of focusing exclusively on the United States' unilateral interests, he spoke of a return to spreading American values. 'No army on Earth can match the electric idea of liberty,' Biden said in his speech at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York.\"</p><p>             THE SENATE:          </p><p>             -- Kentucky's lone Democratic congressman said he'd like to see other candidates get in the race to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Colby Itkowitz and Paul Kane report: \"Rep. John Yarmuth's comments came after a rocky start to Amy McGrath's campaign, which launched on Tuesday. McGrath had a strong first 24 hours in fundraising but then stumbled when answering whether she would have supported the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Yarmuth, who said he is not going to run for the Senate seat, said he was asked earlier 'whether a primary might be helpful in this race.' 'I said, 'Yeah, I think it might be,'' Yarmuth said.\"</p><p>             -- Trump is \"not on board\" with Sessions running to win back the Senate seat he gave up when he became attorney general, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told the Hill.          </p><p>             -- Former congresswoman Cynthia Lummis announced that she is running for the open Senate seat in Wyoming, jumping into what could turn into a contentious Republican primary against Rep. Liz Cheney.Roll Call reports: \"Longtime GOP incumbent Michael B. Enzi announced in May he would not run for re-election. Whoever wins the GOP primary would be the favorite to replace him given the state's strong Republican lean. ... Lummis told reporters on a conference call Thursday afternoon that she spoke to Cheney recently and informed her that she would be running for Senate. She said that if Cheney did get in the race, the primary would be a 'real barn burner.' Lummis said she is more libertarian than Cheney, especially when it comes to international intervention. The former lawmaker also noted that both Cheney and Wyoming's junior senator, John Barrasso, are members of congressional Republican leadership, and argued it would benefit the state to have a member of their delegation who is not and 'can take leadership on.'\"</p><p>             -- With former Tennessee governor Bill Haslam announcing that he will not run for the Senate seat that's opening with Lamar Alexander's retirement, the Republican primary is wide open.The Tennessean reports: \"While U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty and U.S. Rep. Mark Green, R-Clarksville, are the most widely circulated names considering a run, others are also mulling their options. \u00a0Green removed himself from the race Thursday morning, hours after Haslam's decision was announced. Hagerty did not answer questions Thursday about his potential interest in the race but thanked Haslam for his leadership, passion and service. U.S. Rep. David Kustoff said Thursday morning he was thinking about the opportunity to run for the Senate. At least one former member of Congress is out: Diane Black. Teresa Koeberlein, who served as Black's longtime chief of staff, told The Tennessean on Thursday the former congressman is not considering a Senate bid.\"</p><p>             SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:          </p><p>Germany's ambassador to the U.S. showed solidarity with Kim Darroch by inviting the departing U.K. ambassador to breakfast alongside the French and European Union's top diplomats.

Andrew Cuomo surprised his Democratic primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, by aggressively attacking her from start to finish during their debate on Wednesday night at Hofstra University.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to a massive fundraising advantage, the most recent public poll - from Siena College - put Cuomo ahead by 35 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An internal poll conducted for Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) also showed him leading his primary challenger by 35 points three weeks ahead of the federal primaries in June. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had Nixon's endorsement, toppled the longtime boss of the Queens machine by 15 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Party leaders got another taste of the anti-establishment zeitgeist in Florida on Tuesday, where Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum won the Democratic primary for governor after trailing in every public poll. The front-runner he defeated, Gwen Graham, is the child of a former governor. Just like Cuomo.</p><p>             Against this backdrop, the Democratic establishment from coast to coast - which the 60-year-old Cuomo personifies as much as Crowley or Graham - is running scared. Party pooh-bahs are pumped to ride the wave of progressive energy to power in November, but they're also anxious about where it leads. Many of the savviest strategists in Democratic politics privately worry that they're still in the opening phases of the liberal equivalent of the tea party movement, which destabilized the GOP in 2010 and laid the groundwork for Donald Trump's takeover. Who might be the Democratic Robespierre?</p><p>             So it should surprise no one that the governor of America's fourth-most-populous state is leaving nothing to chance as his Sept. 13 primary approaches. That's why he came out swinging against Nixon, a democratic socialist who is best known for her role as Miranda on \"Sex and the City.\" The hour-long debate in Hempstead aired on New York CBS affiliates.</p><p>             -- Cuomo has already migrated leftward on issues such as marijuana, paid family leave and the minimum wage. He didn't position himself last night as a pragmatist - he referred to ICE agents as \"thugs\" at one point - so much as he sought to portray Nixon as an extremist with pie-in-the-sky ideas that would jack up people's taxes and cause \"mayhem.\"          </p><p>Cuomo said Nixon's support for public employees having the right to go on strike might mean police officers off the street, trash uncollected and trains stranded in stations. \"If you allow the public-sector unions to strike, teachers could go on strike,\" he warned. \"There would be no school! Children wouldn't be educated! It would clearly be mayhem!\"</p><p>             Cuomo argued that Nixon's proposal for universal health care would double the tax burden for New Yorkers and divert money\u00a0from other popular programs. The idea \"reminds me of the story of the doctor who says, 'If you survive the operation, you're going to have a long, healthy life,' \" Cuomo said. \"Nobody has done it successfully.\" Nixon responded with a passionate case that health care is a human right and said New York could be a model that others follow.</p><p>             During a dispute about whether the state or the city is to blame for problems on the Big Apple's subway system, Cuomo lost his cool. \"Can you stop interrupting?\" he said. \"Can you stop lying?\" Nixon replied. \"Yeah,\" the governor countered, \"as soon as you do.\"</p><p>             -- Alluding to her career as an actress, Cuomo said Nixon \"lives in a world of fiction.\" \"I live in the world of fact,\" he continued. \"The job of governor ... is not about advocacy. This is a real job.\"</p><p>\"Experience doesn't mean that much if you're not actually good at governing,\" Nixon replied.</p><p>             He accused her of not understanding how the legislative process worked and repeatedly noted that Republicans run the state Senate, which limits how much he can accomplish. She blamed him for the GOP being in control. \"To change the campaign finance laws, you need something called the New York state legislature,\" he said at one point, condescendingly. \"You can't just snap your fingers!\"</p><p>             -- To be sure, that's tame compared with the 1966 California governor's race. Facing a challenge from an actor named Ronald Reagan, Democratic Gov. Pat Brown - whose son Jerry now holds the same office - pointed out that John Wilkes Booth, who killed Abraham Lincoln, was also an actor.</p><p>Reagan, who spent most of his life as a Democrat, didn't run for office until he turned 55. Nixon, a first-time candidate, is 52.</p><p>The Gipper's early opponents in both the Republican establishment and the Democratic Party never took him sufficiently seriously because of his background before he got into politics.

He asked her what kind of message that sends to parents trying to keep their kids off drugs. She did not directly answer. \"Marijuana has been legal for white people for a long time,\" Nixon said. \"It's time to make it legal for everyone else.\"</p><p>Cuomo volunteered that he smoked marijuana in college, and he said he's given \"advice and guidance\" so his own children make \"responsible choices.\"</p><p>\"I think legalizing marijuana ... makes sense,\" said Cuomo. \"I disagree with my opponent that the revenue should go to reparations!\"</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- The Trump administration is denying or stripping passports from a growing number of Americans along the U.S. border, accusing hundreds - if not thousands - of Hispanics of using fraudulent birth certificates, and throwing their citizenship into question.Kevin Sieff reports: \"In a statement, the State Department said that it 'has not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport applications.'\u00a0...

Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\u00a0From Abha Bhattarai: \"Amazon on Wednesday published a rare blog post rebutting the senator's claims that thousands of Amazon employees rely on federal benefits to make ends meet. Those figures are 'inaccurate and misleading,' the company said, because they include temporary workers as well as those who choose to work part time. ... A few hours later, Sanders responded with a press release of his own. ... 'Bottom line: the taxpayers of this country should not have to subsidize employees at a company owned by [Jeff] Bezos who is worth $155 billion,' he wrote. 'That is absurd.' \"</p><p>             -- Former Trump\u00a0adviser Steve Bannon suggested data held by social media companies should be placed in a \"public trust.\" \"That trust is run by an independent board of directors.

Bannon also had harsh words for tech executives, calling them \"sociopaths.\" \"These people are complete narcissists.

Shear and Katie Rogers: \"Not long after [McCain] learned last summer that he had terminal brain cancer, he began convening meetings every Friday in his Capitol Hill office with a group of trusted aides. The subject was his funeral. He obsessed over the music, selecting the Irish ballad 'Danny Boy' and several patriotic hymns. He choreographed the movement of his coffin from Arizona, his home state, to Washington. And in April, when he knew the end was coming, he began reaching out to Republicans, Democrats and even a Russian dissident with requests that they deliver eulogies and serve as pallbearers. By the time he died on Saturday, Mr. McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life - but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to [Trump] and his agenda.\"</p><p>             -- New York Times, \"A Broken Relationship and Accusations of Emotional Abuse: The Case of Keith Ellison,\" by Julie Turkewitz and Farah Stockman: \"Behind the scenes, [the relationship between Keith Ellison and Karen Monahan] was rocky.

Now, as Mr. Ellison runs for attorney general in Minnesota, Ms. Monahan has accused her former boyfriend of emotional abuse and says he once shouted profanities at her, while trying to drag her off a bed. ... The allegations against Mr. Ellison ... are turning into a test among many liberals for where to draw the line between a messy relationship and an emotionally abusive one, and some say they aren't sure where it is.\"</p><p>             -- Yahoo News, \"The agency created to protect elections is broken,\" by Alexander Nazaryan: \"More than a decade before anyone worried about Russian bots, there were chads. ... Hanging chads that could not be counted led George W. Bush to beat Al Gore in Florida in the 2000 election by 537 votes and become president. ... Two years later, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, which was designed to provide funds for states 'to replace punch card voting systems' and to 'establish minimum election administration standards' for the nation's 10,000 voting jurisdictions. The law also provided for the creation of the Election Assistance Commission, or EAC, the nation's first federal agency created to oversee elections at every level of government.

Trump picked a fight over his border wall that doesn't look as though it will end anytime soon. The global economy is slowing at least partly because of the trade war he launched, which he insisted would be \"good\" and \"easy to win.\" And the sugar high from the Trump tax cuts has mostly worn off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But Trump is not the only world leader who has opted to stay home in 2019 because of a domestic political crisis that can be viewed through the prism of a backlash to globalization.          </p><p>             British Prime Minister Theresa May is skipping Davos so she can manage Brexit. \"May on Monday spelled out a 'Plan B' for Brexit that appeared very much like a warmed-over version of her Plan A, which suffered a crushing defeat in Parliament last week,\" Karla Adam and William Booth report from London. \"May was forced to return to Westminster by a newly assertive Parliament that has been trying to exert more control over what withdrawal from the European Union looks like. ... May refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit - the possibility that Britain could 'crash out' of the EU without a deal March 29, which the government warns could create economic hardship. ... May said that the people already voted for Brexit and that the job of her government and Parliament is to deliver it. A second referendum, she warned, 'could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy.'\"</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron opted to stick around Paris to deal with the Yellow Jacket protests. \"Citizens wearing the yellow vests French motorists are required to carry in their vehicles started weekly protests of a fuel tax increase in mid-November. Anger over the president's policies that were seen as favoring the wealthy swelled the demonstrations into a broader anti-government movement,\" the AP reports. \"Macron launched a 'national debate' last week to solicit ideas from citizens and to help assuage the anger. Thousands of people nevertheless turned out in Paris and several other cities Saturday, the 10th consecutive weekend of demonstrations.\" Still, Macron coaxed more than 150 corporate types to meet with him yesterday at the Palace of Versailles on their way to Davos. Big tech companies like Cisco, Microsoft and IBM - plus the candymaker Mars - announced a combined $682 million in planned investments.</p><p>             More than 60 heads of state will still fly to the Swiss Alps for the five-day confab, along with more than 3,000 of the haves, the have-mores and the hangers-on. But the meeting in many ways underscores the extent to which globalization continues to be in retreat and global elites have failed to turn the tide of populism. \"The combination of climate change, income inequality, technology and geopolitics pose an existential threat to humanity,\" Klaus Schwab, the founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum, said in a statement released ahead of the conference.</p><p>             -- The growing parallels to the 1930s are eerie, as powerful people repeat many of the same mistakes: falling prey to the rising tides of isolationism, nativism and protectionism.          </p><p>             -- The theme of this year's conference is \"Globalization 4.0: Shaping a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\" Sebastian Buckup, the director of programming at Davos, lamented in a lengthy essay last week that we live in \"an era of fortresses and walls,\" and he said the goal of the meeting is to draft \"a blueprint to construct a geopolitical framework that can support this era's needs.\"</p><p>             \"If we only respond to an accelerating world by reinforcing walls, we risk ending up trapped in our fortresses,\" Buckup said.\u00a0\"However, if we respond to an accelerating world by trying not to order it, we then surrender to chaos. ... New powers, problems, and technological possibilities are pushing hard against structures that were built for other purposes and other times. We need a new architecture-but where to start?\"</p><p>             -- One central focus of this week's gathering is climate change, but the world has backed away from collective action in the Trump era.

Oxfam published a report on Sunday, to coincide with the start of Davos, that shows billionaires got 12 percent richer last year while the 3.8 billion people who make up the world's poorest half saw their wealth decline by 11 percent. \"This is not inevitable, this is unacceptable,\" said Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. \"Oxfam said the number of billionaires has almost doubled since the financial crisis a decade ago yet tax rates on the wealthy and corporations have fallen to their lowest levels in decades,\" per the AP. \"Byanyima said 'the people in Davos' have the power to be 'the solution to end extreme inequality.'\" But they haven't.</p><p>             -- Rising fears about the state of the world's biggest economies are likely to preoccupy the Davos crowd as much as anything else. \"China reported Monday that its economy expanded by 6.6 percent last year - a figure that would be good for many countries but represents the slowest growth for China in 28 years.

Global trade threats came in second. A survey of 1,300 chief executives released Monday by PwC found that 30 percent of business leaders believe that global growth will decline in the next 12 months, a record jump in pessimism to about six times the number who said that last year. The most pronounced decline in optimism was in North America, where it dropped from 63 percent a year ago to 37 percent now.\"</p><p>             -- Asian markets retreated overnight in the face of all this bad economic news.          </p><p>             -- \"And there was equally concerning news for the global elite in the annual Edelman Trust Barometer, which showed the 'trust gap' between college-educated and wealthy people and a more frustrated mass population widened to a record extent,\" the Financial Times reports. \"Only one in five of the 33,000 people polled across 27 countries for the Edelman Trust Barometer said the current system was working for them, with more than 70 percent voicing a sense of injustice and a desire for change.

Yet lacking any consensus against Trump, Walt sees many leaders as engaged in a waiting game to try and sit him out. 'There is no longer this idea that he'd be reined in by the establishment and that you'd have a fairly normal administration,' said Walt. 'People are now fully aware that he's extremely impulsive and erratic and will continue to challenge the status quo. That means something different depending where you are.'</p><p>\"Leaders from all three camps will be present in Davos: those from traditional U.S. allies such as Canada and Germany who are resisting as far as possible in the hope they can wait Trump out; rivals from China and Russia who thought they could exploit the opportunities but have found him too erratic; and those in countries like Israel, Hungary and Brazil who have benefited from the environment around Trump's rise,\" Wainer writes for Bloomberg. \"Among the forum's headline attractions is German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who can be expected to build on her New Year's address denouncing nationalism and populism that reinforced her status as a Trump adversary. Yet she and Macron were unable to prevent Trump from quitting the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris climate accord. Germany is in the firing line if he follows through on his threat to impose punitive tariffs on imported cars.\"</p><p>             -- An American delegation still planned to attend after Trump pulled out on Jan. 10, including the secretaries of state, treasury and commerce, but the White House announced they'd stay home last Thursday afternoon. The administration did so reluctantly in the hours after the president denied Speaker Nancy Pelosi access to a military aircraft for a long-planned CODEL to visit combat troops in Afghanistan. \"Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos,\" Trump tweeted two weeks ago.</p><p>-- \"Of the Group of Seven countries, only Germany, Italy and Japan will send their top leaders.

The most anticipated appearance may be that of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is not even a full month into his presidency.

It's the equivalent of calling a conservative a RINO (Republican In Name Only). Democratic activists, based on polling and interviews, appear uninterested in nominating a billionaire or businessman to take on Trump, which is why Tom Steyer chose not to run and why Mike Bloomberg still could take a pass if he concludes there's no real path to victory.

In a new piece for Time magazine, he argues that the people who attend this conference are hypocrites who bear some responsibility for problems ailing the world today. \"You enabled the nationalism that threatens our societies. You stiffed so many of us,\" Giridharadas writes. \"You fought for rules that let you steal the future from our children. You pushed for monopolies ... and austerity and deregulation.

There is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford. By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.\"</p><p>             Klarman used to be the single largest GOP donor in New England, but he's redirected his giving to Democrats because of his distaste for Trump. \"This post-truth moment is quite dangerous,\" he writes in the letter to his investors, which include the Harvard and Yale endowments. \"Imagine an incident that threatens national security.

The legislation, released late Monday, would reopen the government through Sept. 30 while funding a variety of other immigration security measures and spending $12.7 billion on hurricane and wildfire disaster relief.

But the House legislation is dead on arrival in the Senate, where McConnell has made clear he will not advance any spending bills Trump won't sign.</p><p>\"The bill being voted on in the Senate also contains significant changes to asylum procedures for Central American minors, a fact that came to light only when the legislation was released late Monday night and sparked an angry reaction from immigrant rights activists. The legislation would require these minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, not at the U.S. border, as now occurs, and they would be returned home if they sought to apply for asylum at the U.S. border. It would also put new caps on asylum claims from Central American minors.\"</p><p>             -- Republican senators continue to largely support Trump's strategy, partly because of\u00a0intense pressure from the base.Seung Min Kim and Sean Sullivan report: \"Under pressure from conservatives to help Trump deliver on a signature campaign promise and unable to persuade him to avert the partial government shutdown, these lawmakers have all but surrendered to the president's will.

Asked about the pressure from constituents and some of the 800,000 affected federal workers to end the impasse, GOP senators insisted they are facing equal - if not more - insistence to stand behind Trump and his call for $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, especially from conservative voters.\"</p><p>             -- Democratic Sen.

The book, \"Team of Vipers,\" was written by former West Wing communications aide Cliff Sims.Philip Rucker recounts one of Sims's anecdotes about Trump berating former House speaker Paul Ryan: \"Trump watched on television, increasingly angry as [Ryan] criticized his handling of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He held the remote control 'like a pistol' and yelled for an assistant to get the Republican leader on the phone. 'Paul, do you know why Democrats have been kicking your a-- for decades? Because they know a little word called 'loyalty,' ' Trump told Ryan ... 'Why can't you be loyal to your president, Paul?' The tormenting continued. Trump recalled Ryan distancing himself from Trump in October 2016, in the days after the 'Access Hollywood' video in which he bragged of fondling women first surfaced in The Washington Post. 'I remember being in Wisconsin and your own people were booing you,' Trump told him, according to [Sims]. 'You were out there dying like a dog, Paul. Like a dog! And what'd I do? I saved your a--.' ...</p><p>\"Sims depicts Trump as deeply suspicious of his own staff. He recalls a private huddle in which he and Keith Schiller, the president's longtime bodyguard and confidant, helped Trump draw up an enemies list with a Sharpie on White House stationery. 'We're going to get rid of all the snakes, even the bottom-feeders,' Trump told them. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly told the staff that he viewed his job as serving the 'country first, POTUS second,' which Sims interpreted as potentially hostile to Trump's agenda. Sims recounts that Kelly once confided to him in a moment of exasperation: 'This is the worst [expletive] job I've ever had. People apparently think that I care when they write that I might be fired. If that ever happened, it would be the best day I've had since I walked into this place.' ...</p><p>\"At times, Trump evinced less rage than a lack of interest. Sims recounts one time when Ryan was in the Oval Office explaining the ins and outs of the Republican health-care bill to the president. As Ryan droned on for 15 minutes, Trump sipped on a glass of Diet Coke, peered out at the Rose Garden, stared aimlessly at the walls and, finally, walked out. Ryan kept talking as the president wandered down the hall to his private dining room, where he flicked on his giant flat-screen TV. Apparently, he had had enough of Ryan's talk. It fell to Vice President Pence to retrieve Trump and convince him to return to the Oval Office so they could continue their strategy session. ...</p><p>\"Perhaps the book's most cinematic chapter of chaos is 'The Mooch Is Loose,' a reconstruction of Anthony Scaramucci's 11 days as White House communications director. Sims was Scaramucci's right-hand man and describes the flamboyant aide's hunt for 'leakers,' which began with his own staff. Scaramucci assembled the 40-odd media aides and threatened to fire them all, Sims writes, as if he were a 'fire-breathing dragon that had just returned from laying waste to the unsuspecting peasants in the village.' Sims writes that Scaramucci ordered them to reply to anyone in the White House instructing them to leak information to a reporter, including then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, by saying: 'I cannot do that. I only report to Anthony Scaramucci and he reports directly to the president of the United States.' Even Trump was amused. 'Can you believe this guy?' the president told Sims. 'He's completely out of his mind - like, on drugs or something - totally out of his mind. We'll figure it out, but the guy is crazy.'\"</p><p>             -- Sims, a Trump loyalist, is not overly critical of Trump, but he doesn't paint a completely flattering portrait of the commander in chief either.The New York Times's\u00a0Maggie Haberman reports: The book's\u00a0\"descriptions of Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, defy the public perception of their marriage. Mr. Sims paints Mrs. Trump as protective of her husband as it related to his staff. ... In another scene, Mr. Sims describes the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explaining to Mr. Trump that little could be done about a journalist he did not care for when he asked why the person could not be 'suspended.'\"          </p><p>             THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:          </p><p>             -- Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani tried to back off from\u00a0his comments that negotiations about a potential Trump Tower in Moscow stretched through November 2016.Seung Min Kim reports: \"In a statement Monday, Giuliani said his comments were purely hypothetical and not based on any conversations with the president. His statement Sunday, made on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' that Trump associates had continued negotiations about the real estate project deep into the 2016 campaign had again raised scrutiny into then-candidate Trump's posture toward Moscow, including his call in July of that year for Russia to hack into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's emails. ...

The new information could lend ammunition to criticism that the Trump administration either knowingly let a Kremlin-allied oligarch off easy, or was outmaneuvered by a sophisticated legal and lobbying campaign funded by his companies.\"</p><p>             -- Russian pop star Emin Agalarov canceled his U.S. tour amid a dispute about an interview with Mueller's team.CNN's Kara Scannell reports: \"Agalarov was set to launch a four-city US tour Saturday in New York. Looming over the impending engagement was the prospect of his being on US soil and subject to US law enforcement. Agalarov attorney Scott Balber said talks broke down at the end of last week and the decision to cancel the tour was made Monday. 'It's the only choice we had,' Balber said. 'I've been endeavoring to engage with the special counsel's office as well as various congressional committees and despite our best effort we haven't been able to reach an agreement on the terms.'\" The special counsel and congressional committees have expressed interest in talking to Agalarov about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which he initiated.</p><p>             -- An American banker with ties to Putin has attracted congressional investigators' attention for seeking access to Trump's presidential transition team.ABC News's Matthew Mosk, Katherine Faulders and John Santucci report: \"The banker, Robert Foresman, never got the role he was seeking with the fledgling Trump administration. ... Foresman, who is now vice chairman of the Swiss bank UBS's investment arm, lived for years in Moscow, where he led a $3 billion Russian investment fund and was touted by his new company as someone who maintains connections to [Putin's] inner circle. ... There has been renewed interest in Foresman in recent weeks, coming as prosecutors in New York have ratcheted up inquiries into the events that occurred during the Trump transition and in the lead up to the Trump inauguration.\"</p><p>             -- A lawyer for American Paul Whelan, who is being detained in Moscow on espionage charges, said his client was given a flash drive containing a \"state secret.\" \"But how he got it, what he was supposed to do with it, and whether Whelan knew that he had secret information is unknown,\" Vladimir Zherebenkov added.

As part of the process, CNBC held an online poll meant to guide the expert panel as it pared a list of 200 contenders down to 25.

An affable, neatly groomed man, Afari is among the few known participants in the Islamic State's chemical weapons program to be captured alive. He described in matter-of-fact detail the terrorist group's successful attempts to make sulfur mustard - a first-generation chemical weapon that inflicted tens of thousands of casualties during World War I - as part of an ambitious, little-understood effort to create novel weapons and delivery systems to defend the Islamic State's territory and terrorize its opponents. His account was confirmed and augmented by U.S. and Kurdish officials who participated in missions to destroy the Islamic State's weapons plants and to kill or capture its senior leaders.</p><p>\"The stories shed new light on a chemical weapons project that was unique in the history of modern terrorist groups, with university laboratories and manufacturing facilities and a cadre of scientists and technicians. Weapons created by the Islamic State were used in scores of attacks on soldiers and civilians in Iraq and Syria, collectively inflicting hundreds of casualties, U.S. and Iraqi officials say.\"</p><p>             -- U.S. spies have been secretly meeting with their North Korean counterparts for a decade,according to the Wall Street Journal's Michael R. Gordon and Warren P. Strobel. \"The secret channel between the [CIA] and spies from America's bitter adversary included two missions to Pyongyang in 2012 during the Obama administration by Michael Morell, then deputy CIA director, and at least one by his successor, Avril Haines, say current and former U.S. officials. The channel appears to have gone dormant late in the Obama administration. Mike Pompeo re-energized it while CIA director, sending an agency officer to meet with North Korean counterparts in Singapore in August 2017. By early 2018, a whirlwind of secret and public talks were underway, which brought together Messrs. Trump and Kim in a pomp-filled Singapore meeting in June. The intelligence channel played a role. The two sides are preparing for a second summit in late February.\"</p><p>             -- A think tank report identified another secret North Korean missile base days after the White House announced plans for a second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un.Lena H. Sun reports: \"The report, released Monday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the base is one of approximately 20 undeclared missile operating bases, part of Pyongyang's ongoing ballistic missile program. Researchers at the center's Beyond Parallel project said the latest report provides more evidence that North Korea is not dismantling its weapons facilities. 'While diplomacy is critical, and should be the primary way to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem, any future agreement must take account of all of the operational missile base facilities that are a threat to U.S. and South Korean security,' the report said.\"</p><p>             SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:          </p><p>Deripaska, the Russian oligarch accused of election interference who just got sanctions relief from the Trump administration,\u00a0is staying away from Davos this year, per a Post correspondent in Moscow:</p><p>Kamala Harris's communications director tweeted a photo of the newly announced presidential candidate:</p><p>Harris's press secretary added this:</p><p>Harris's deputy press secretary emphasized her common points of background with her boss:</p><p>A PBS NewsHour reporter analyzed the specifics of Harris's announcement:</p><p>A CNN reporter remarked on the number of women already running for president:</p><p>The communications director of C-SPAN remembered another black woman who sought the Democratic nomination:</p><p>An NBC News reporter shared this photo of a Democratic senator and 2020 contender meeting with a former gubernatorial candidate:</p><p>Booker responded to a Twitter user who asked about his 2020 plans:</p><p>A New York Times reporter noted what a difference three years make:</p><p>An Atlantic writer observed that 2020 candidates composed MLK tweets reflecting\u00a0their campaign priorities:</p><p>The president and the vice president visited the MLK memorial:</p><p>A fellow for New America used the two-minute visit as an opportunity to deride Trump:</p><p>Rep.

Caro: \"I am constantly being asked why it takes me so long to finish my books. Well, it's the research that takes the time-the research and whatever it is in me that makes the research take so very much longer than I had planned. I'm currently working on the fifth and final book in 'The Years of Lyndon Johnson,' about the nineteen-sixties. I am also planning to write a full-scale memoir, describing in some detail my experiences in researching and writing my books about Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson-my experiences in learning about these two men and their methods of acquiring and using power-and also the efforts that were made to keep me from learning about these men and their methods.</p><p>\"Which leads to a final question: Why am I publishing these random recollections toward a memoir while I'm still working on the last volume of the Johnson biography, when I haven't finished it, while I'm still-at the age of eighty-three-several years from finishing it? Why don't I just include this material in the longer, full-length memoir I'm hoping to write? The answer is, I'm afraid, quite obvious, and, if I forget it for a few days, I am frequently reminded of it, by journalists who, in writing about me and my hope of finishing, often express their doubts in a sarcastic phrase: 'Do the math.' Well, I can do that math. I am well aware that I may never get to write the memoir, although I have so many thoughts about writing, so many anecdotes about research, that I would like to preserve for anyone interested enough to read them. I decided that, just in case, I'd put some of them down on paper now.\"</p><p>             -- Chicago Tribune, \"It started when he couldn't grasp a pen.

On Tuesday the Kenilworth couple, both 38, will launch I Am ALS, an effort born out of months of researching not only what might help Wallach, but also trying to understand why such a devastating disease is less funded and less understood than others.

The bill still needs the House's approval, but it is expected to pass there. ... The minimum-wage measure, sponsored by four Democrats, died in a 19-to-21 vote, with every Democrat in favor and every Republican opposed.

NPR and NBC aired interviews this morning with Hughes as part of his rollout.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,\" writes Hughes, a liberal who once owned the New Republic magazine. \"Facebook's dominance is not an accident of history.\u00a0The company's strategy was to beat every competitor in plain view, and regulators and the government tacitly - and at times explicitly - approved.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hughes faults regulators for being asleep at the wheel and specifically criticizes the Federal Trade Commission for approving of Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. \"Mark's influence is staggering, far beyond that of almost anyone else in the private sector or in government,\" he writes. \"The most problematic aspect of Facebook's power\u00a0is Mark's unilateral control over speech. There is no precedent for his ability to monitor, organize and even censor the conversations of two billion people.\"</p><p>             -- Facebook has increasingly been squeezed from the right and the left. The company's brand has taken an enormous hit since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which spawned a series of investigations and intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, from the European Union to Canada and the U.S. Congress.</p><p>             -- Zuckerberg has been trying to get out front of calls to break up his company by calling for new regulations, expressing openness to more oversight and promising users recently that the social network will reorient itself to prioritize privacy.\u00a0The 34-year-old is worth an estimated $62.3 billion. Forbes pegs him as the eighth richest person in the world.</p><p>             -- Facebook isn't afraid of \"a few more rules,\" Hughes explains, because the company can afford to comply with them and pay billions in fines. Facebook recorded $15 billion in revenue during the first three months of this year, for instance, putting the publicly traded company on a pace to rake in $60 billion this year. The tech giant disclosed to shareholders last month that it expects a fine as high as $5 billion from the FTC for its mishandling of its users' personal information, and the markets shrugged.</p><p>Hughes believes that the federal government bringing an antitrust case is the only way to bring real accountability, which he believes is why Facebook is so strongly against it. \"Mark may never have a boss, but he needs to have some check on his power,\" Hughes writes. \"The American government needs to do two things: break up Facebook's monopoly and regulate the company to make it more accountable to the American people. ... Just breaking up Facebook is not enough.\u00a0We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies. Its first mandate should be to protect privacy.\"</p><p>             -- President Trump threatened last Friday to \"monitor\" social media sites for their \"censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS\" on the day after Facebook permanently banned far-right figures and organizations including the conspiracy theory site Infowars. The company also permanently banned users including Louis Farrakhan, the founder of the Nation of Islam who has been accused of anti-Semitism, along with far-right figures Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer and Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars. The company said their presence on Facebook and Instagram had become \"dangerous.\"</p><p>             -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies a major plank of her 2020 platform. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee that oversees antitrust and competition policy, talks constantly about the danger of monopolies on the campaign trail. This is not some obscure debate for law school faculty lounges any longer. Crowds eat it up - in rural Iowa.</p><p>Hughes links Facebook's market power to the staggering, broader consolidation of corporate power. \"In the past 20 years, more than 75 percent of American industries, from airlines to pharmaceuticals, have experienced increased concentration, and the average size of public companies has tripled,\" Hughes notes. \"The results are a decline in entrepreneurship, stalled productivity growth, and higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.\"</p><p>             He laments that Facebook has become almost too big to fail in the eyes of regulators. \"The company's strategy was to beat every competitor in plain view, and regulators and the government tacitly - and at times explicitly - approved,\" he writes. \"This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation.\"</p><p>             -- A bipartisan group of senators expressed frustration earlier this week with the slow-going federal probe into Facebook's privacy practices, pushing the FTC to move more swiftly and consider imposing tough punishments that target the company's top executives. \"This investigation has been long delayed in conclusion - raising the specter of a remedy that is too little too late,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) wrote in an open letter on Monday. \"The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable. The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth.\"</p><p>             -- Democratic lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) have even been pushing the FTC to specifically and personally target Zuckerberg himself as part of its investigation.          </p><p>             -- Many senior Democrats on Capitol Hill were especially irate about the public support that senior Facebook executive Joel Kaplan showed for Brett Kavanaugh after Christine Blasey Ford came forward last year. The company said Kaplan, a Republican and Facebook's policy chief, was acting in his personal capacity when he sat behind Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing and hosted a party at his house for the justice to celebrate his triumph despite the allegations of sexual assault. This led to strong internal backlash from employees at Facebook. During an all-staff meeting, Kaplan said he should have checked with Zuckerberg ahead of time.</p><p>             The donnybrook strained some of the company's relationships on the Hill and put in stark relief for congressional Democrats that Facebook is neither their friend nor ally. Facebook reinforced this view the week before last by hiring another Republican legal operative who worked with Kavanaugh during George W. Bush's administration to be their general counsel. To be sure, the company has also hired some prominent privacy advocates lately for other jobs.</p><p>Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has also lost a lot of her cachet with Democrats in D.C. She admitted in November that she received information about the company's work with a Republican-aligned firm called Definers that conducted opposition research against the company's critics on the left, including Democratic donor George Soros.</p><p>             -- Meanwhile, there are daily reminders of how central Facebook has become in American culture. Consider these three unrelated stories that have posted in the past day:</p><p>             Thousands of people who police Facebook's site for offensive content are contractors, not employees,             and they're starting to air their grievances about unsatisfactory working conditions. They're protesting micromanagement, pay cuts and inadequate counseling support while they perform one of Facebook's most demanding jobs. (Elizabeth Dwoskin)</p><p>Facebook is auto-generating videos that celebrate extremist images.\u00a0A whistleblower's complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0alleges the social media giant has exaggerated its success at staying ahead of extremists by taking down their posts. Instead, the company has inadvertently made use of extremist propaganda in promotional videos that collect a year's worth of user\u00a0content to make snazzy videos. (AP)</p><p>Instagram still has no control over the spread of vaccine misinformation on its platform, two months after Facebook promised that it would do a better job of combating the falsehoods. \"Instagram executives said vaccine misinformation is not eligible for recommendation to its Explore, hashtag and search pages. But discussion about vaccines as a general topic is still allowed and can be recommended in these places,\"\u00a0CNN reports.\u00a0\"An Instagram spokesperson added that its efforts are focused on vaccine misinformation, not the anti-vax movement. This means that Instagram wants to curtail false information about vaccines, but not ban people who identify as anti-vaxers or publish anti-vaccine posts.\"</p><p>             -- In his piece for the Times, Hughes apologizes for his role. \"I'm disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders,\" he writes.</p><p>Hughes doesn't fault Zuckerberg for trying to conquer the world. \"Yet he has created a leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice,\" he writes. \"It's on our government to ensure that we never lose the magic of the invisible hand.\"</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- North Korea launched two short-range missiles. This is the second such test launch in less than a week amid rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. It came around 4:30 p.m. local time and appeared to have been fired from\u00a0Sino-ri, a base that houses medium-range ballistic missiles. (Simon Denyer)</p><p>             -- Kim Jong Un might be lashing out because of a worsening food shortage.Denyer explains: \"Analysts say there is no doubt that the ultimate blame for the humanitarian crisis rests with Pyongyang, which has spent hugely on nuclear advances and other military projects while neglecting the welfare of ordinary citizens. But leading medical and humanitarian experts also argue that U.S.-led sanctions - which include fuel imports - have also stifled North Korean agriculture and prevented the arrival of vital medical aid. ... A United Nations report issued Friday showed more than 10 million people do not have enough food to last until the next harvest.\"          </p><p>             -- Meanwhile, Beijing promised\u00a0tit-for-tat retaliation if Trump follows through tomorrow with his threat to put new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Anna Fifield and David J. Lynch report: \"The Chinese warning - issued as China's vice premier arrived in Washington - signaled that Beijing was prepared to take the same hard-line route as Trump and raise tariffs on American products in response. 'An escalation in trade frictions is not in line with the American or Chinese interests or the interests of the world, and would thus be much to China's regret,' a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on its website. 'But if the U.S. goes ahead with its tariff measures against China, China will have to resort to necessary countermeasures,' the statement added.\"</p><p>             GET SMART FAST:  </p><p>             THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:          </p><p>             -- The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt of Congress, hours after Trump asserted executive privilege over special counsel Bob Mueller's report.Rachael Bade, Carol D. Leonnig and Matt Zapotosky report: \"Democrats could vote as early as next week on the Barr contempt citation ... That vote would enable House counsels to take Barr to civil court and try to persuade a judge to force him to release Mueller's evidence, one of many high-stakes legal fights between the executive and legislative branches. ... House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that Trump is 'becoming self-impeachable' because of all his efforts to fight congressional investigations, though she has remained firm in her resistance to initiate impeachment proceedings ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>\"The Justice Department considered it important for the White House to assert executive privilege before the House voted on contempt because, in its view, doing so would effectively invalidate the citation ... It believed that Barr could not be legitimately held in contempt for withholding materials over which the president had asserted executive privilege ... But if anything, Barr's move only redoubled Democrats' insistence to press ahead with contempt. During a day-long hearing, Democrats criticized the use of privilege as illegitimate because much of the Mueller report has already been made public - and because Trump allowed his aides to cooperate with the special counsel months ago.\"</p><p>             -- Donald Trump Jr. has been subpoenaed by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee after the president's eldest son stonewalled for several weeks in response to a request for a second interview.Ashley Parker, Karoun Demirjian and Shane Harris report: \"As negotiations over Trump Jr.'s testimony dragged on, committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) became increasingly frustrated and believed that Trump Jr. was defying the committee's authority and not honoring his original agreement.\u00a0... If Trump Jr. flouts the subpoena, it puts Burr in the awkward position of potentially taking Trump Jr. to court as the president continues his standoff with the House. ...\u00a0Trump Jr. is 'exasperated' by the committee's actions, according to a person who has discussed the subpoena with him, because he already 'offered to continue to cooperate in writing.'</p><p>\"The panel is bringing back several key witnesses for second interviews to give lawmakers a chance to question people previously interviewed only by committee staffers\u00a0... But concerns about Trump Jr.'s statements are potentially more problematic for the president. According to a transcript of Trump Jr.'s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he told lawmakers that he did not tell his father about the Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.</p><p>\"Trump Jr.'s testimony to other committees was in line with the account he gave to the Senate Judiciary panel, several Democrats said. Yet in Mueller's report, the president's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he recalled being in Trump's office when Trump Jr. talked about a meeting to get 'adverse information' on Clinton. Cohen told Mueller's team that it appeared that father and son had previously discussed the subject. Mueller never interviewed Trump Jr.\"</p><p>             -- Trump's legal team urged a federal judge last night to block the House Oversight Committee's subpoena for financial statements from the president's accounting firm, calling the request \"unconstitutional.\"Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"In a 24-page filing, Trump's legal team asked the D.C. court to block a committee subpoena to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, saying the panel's demand 'lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.' Even if there were one, Trump's lawyers argued, the newly elected Democratic-led House overstepped its authority by passing a campaign finance and ethics bill as its first legislation in January that would require, among other things, the president and the vice president to make public 10 years of tax returns.\"</p><p>             -- The New York State Senate approved legislation\u00a0allowing congressional committees to access Trump's state tax returns.Jeff Stein reports: \"The bill must still be approved by the State Assembly and signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.), but Cuomo has expressed support for the measure and Democrats have a majority in the legislature's lower chamber. ... New York's legislation would not give House Democrats access to the six years of federal tax returns sought by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.). But the state returns could provide an unprecedented look into Trump's New York business dealings, his income, and a range of other personal financial information, according to legal experts.\"</p><p>             -- The bigger picture: Trump's refusal to cooperate with Congress is setting the stage for a constitutional crisis.Devlin Barrett, Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: \"On the surface, the fight over an unredacted copy of Mueller's report - and its underlying investigative documents - hinges on disagreements over the law surrounding grand jury material and legal precedents. But at its heart, Wednesday's dispute is about the seemingly in\u00adtrac\u00adtable conflict between House Democrats, who are seeking a public airing of damaging details about Trump, and the president, who has vowed to give them nothing. The two sides now appear headed for a court fight over the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, and at a faster pace than previous legal battles over executive privilege. Each appears to be proceeding with an eye on how such a conflict might play out in the 2020 race for president and the possibility, however faint, of impeachment proceedings.</p><p>\"In past administrations, conflicts over congressional access to White House documents and witnesses have often dragged on for a year or longer before reaching this stage of impasse. ... With the Mueller report, it took only weeks to reach the state, and may serve as an important test case for ongoing fights between the White House and Congress.\"</p><p>             -- FBI officials will brief members of Florida's congressional delegation next week on suspected Russian hacking during the 2016 election.Politico's Gary Fineout reports: \"The agency will sit down Republican Sen. Rick Scott ahead of the delegation meeting. ... Mueller last month revealed the suspected hacking in a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The disclosure jolted Florida officials, who had previously insisted the Russians had been unsuccessful in their hacking efforts.\"</p><p>             THE NEW WORLD ORDER:          </p><p>             -- \"Trump is questioning his administration's aggressive strategy in Venezuela following the failure of a U.S.-backed effort to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, complaining he was misled about how easy it would be to replace the socialist strongman with a young opposition figure,\"per Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey, John Hudson and Seung Min Kim. \"The president's dissatisfaction has crystallized around national security adviser John Bolton ... Trump has said in recent days that Bolton wants to get him 'into a war' - a comment he has made in jest in the past but that now belies his more serious concerns, one senior administration official said. Trump has complained over the last week that Bolton and others underestimated Maduro, according to three senior administration officials ... Trump has expressed concern that Bolton has boxed him into a corner and gone beyond where he is comfortable.</p><p>\"The events of April 30 have effectively shelved serious discussion of a heavy U.S. military response, current and former officials as well as outside advisers said. Rather, U.S. officials think time is on their side and that Maduro will fall of his own weight. ... Trump is now not inclined to have any sort of military intervention in Venezuela ... Trump has, in Oval Office meetings and phone calls with advisers, questioned his administration providing such strong support of [Juan] Guaid\u00f3. Some White House officials said Trump likes the charismatic leader, whom he has called courageous, but has wondered aloud whether he is ready to take over and about how much the administration really knows about him.</p><p>\"U.S. defense leaders regard any military scenario involving boots on the ground in Venezuela as a quagmire and warn that standoff weapons such as Tomahawk missiles run a major risk of killing civilians. The White House has repeatedly asked for military planning short of an invasion, however. Officials said the options under discussion while Maduro is still in power include sending additional military assets to the region, increasing aid to neighboring countries such as Colombia and other steps to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced Venezuelans outside of Venezuela. More forward-leaning options include sending ships to waters off Venezuela as a show of force. Other steps under discussion are intended for after Maduro is gone, when U.S. military personnel might be permitted inside Venezuela to help with humanitarian responses.\"</p><p>             -- Masked Venezuelan intelligence police detained the vice president of the National Assembly late last night in a dramatic operation in eastern Caracas, marking the first senior opposition official taken into custody by the Maduro regime in retaliation for last week's failed military uprising.Anthony Faiola reports: \"Assembly Vice President Edgar Zambrano live-tweeted the detention, saying his van was surrounded by forces from Venezuela's SEBIN police force. When he refused to exit, Zambrano said, his vehicle was forcibly towed to the infamous Helicoide prison, a notorious holding area for political prisoners. The move came after Zambrano became one of 10 opposition officials charged with treason, conspiracy and rebellion by the pro-Maduro Supreme Court in connection to the April 30 plot. Thus far, the leader of the uprising - Guaid\u00f3, who has been recognized as Venezuela's rightful leader by the United States and more than 50 other nations - has not been charged.\"</p><p>             -- U.S. allies in Latin America want change in Venezuela, but they're very much against military intervention.Karen DeYoung reports: \"Latin Americans, who already see the Venezuelan crisis spilling over their borders in the form of millions of refugees, appreciate U.S. interest and determination. ... [But] the history of U.S. invasion and occupation in the region, along with covert involvement in regime change, is long and unlamented. Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba, Chile, and more. Even those leaders who might be happy to see [Maduro] ousted with U.S. force believe there would be a heavy price to pay among their own constituents.\"</p><p>             MORE ESCALATION AGAINST IRAN:          </p><p>             -- Mike Pompeo canceled a scheduled visit to Greenland so he can return to Washington to manage the Iran situation.\u00a0(AP)</p><p>             -- The Trump administration issued new sanctions against Iran, targeting its metal exports, hours after the Iranian president threatened to start enriching more uranium if it doesn't get relief from U.S. measures that are crippling its economy. The new round of sanctions, outlined in an executive order, apply to Iranian iron, steel, aluminum and copper, Carol Morello reports: \"Trump said the newest sanctions target a sector that generates 10 percent of its export revenue. 'Tehran can expect further actions unless it fundamentally alters its conduct,' Trump said. 'Since our exit from the Iran deal, which is broken beyond repair, the United States has put forward 12 conditions that offer the basis of a comprehensive agreement with Iran. I look forward to someday meeting with the leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves.'\"</p><p>             -- U.S. government sources say that Iran has approved attacks on American troops,NBC News Pentagon correspondent Courtney Kube reports: \"The intelligence shows that an Iranian official discussed activating Iranian-backed groups to target Americans, but did not mention targeting the militaries of other nations, the officials said. Among the specific threats the U.S. military is now tracking, officials say, are possible missile attacks by Iranian dhows, or small ships, in the Persian Gulf; attacks in Iraq by Iranian-trained Shiite militia groups; and attacks against U.S. ships by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. ... (They) say that in addition to learning that an Iranian official had discussed attacks on Americans, the U.S. began seeing the movement of Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in various places across the region, prompting the commander of U.S. Central Command, Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie, to request additional forces move to the region.\"</p><p>             THE REALITY TV\u00a0PRESIDENCY:          </p><p>             -- At a conference last night in Las Vegas for hedge fund investors, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci interviewed the man who fired him: Former White House chief of staff John Kelly. They said they've become friends and vented about their time in the Trump administration. The Daily Beast's Tarpley Hitt reports: \"Scaramucci questioned the former chief of staff about ... curbing the president's Twitter use ('That's not my job.'), the Mueller Report ('I tried aggressively to stay out of it.'), and whether Trump is a stable genius ('I wouldn't pass judgement on either of those.')\"</p><p>             -- During the first stop of her latest tell-all tour, Stormy Daniels said she's not sure if Trump, who she says had an extramarital affair with her, is worse than her former lawyer, Michael Avenatti. The adult-film star also said she'll\u00a0apologize to first lady Melania Trump only when \"she apologizes to the country.\"The Daily Beast's Amy Zimmerman reports: \"Near the end of the evening, an audience member asked Daniels about Trump's hypothetical future downfall. ... 'Allowing someone to get away with things that are definitely illegal sets a very terrifying precedent,' Daniels continued, explaining to the crowd that she was choosing her words very deliberately. 'It's basically a green light.' 'Do I think he'll be re-elected? I don't know,' she concluded. 'I hope not.'\"</p><p>             -- The Florida Bar said an investigation will proceed into whether one of Trump's closest allies on the Hill, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), attempted to intimidate Michael Cohen, who is now in prison after arranging hush money payments to Daniels.The Tampa Bay Times's Steve Contorno reports: \"A grand jury-like panel called the Grievance Committee will next decide whether there is probable cause that Gaetz's tweet broke the state Supreme Court's rules for lawyers. ... In moving the case against Gaetz to this step, the Florida Bar is also signaling that its initial review determined that the allegations against Gaetz would, if proven true, be a violation of the rules. ... The complaint against Gaetz stems from a menacing tweet he sent on Feb. 27, the eve of Cohen's testimony before a House committee. Gaetz wrote: 'Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot... .'\"</p><p>             THE SWAMP IS NOT DRAINED:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Trump derailed a bipartisan casino bill yesterday after a high-priced lobbyist married to one of his staffers said that doing so would hurt 2020 candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D).Mike DeBonis, Felicia Sonmez and Josh Dawsey report: \"The intervention by Trump, contained in a morning tweet, eroded Republican support and prompted House Democrats to postpone a vote on the measure, which would pave the way for a new Massachusetts tribal casino. The bill, H.R. 312, would confirm the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe's sovereignty over 321 acres of land - including the Taunton, Mass., site eyed for the casino project. It was scheduled for a House vote Wednesday under expedited procedures requiring a two-thirds majority to pass, reflecting its broad support.\"</p><p>             Follow the money: American Conservative Union Chairman Matthew Schlapp, who organizes CPAC, is lobbying for Twin River Management Group, which operates two Rhode Island casinos that fear the competition from a new casino across the state line.\u00a0Schlapp's wife, Mercedes, is White House strategic communications director. \"The singular focus on Warren appeared to reflect a strategy embraced by Schlapp, who focused on the senator in a Wednesday morning tweet and an email he sent to Republicans on Capitol Hill Tuesday,\" per Mike, Felicia and Josh. \"According to a person familiar with the circumstances surrounding the tweet, Trump was happy to attack the project once he learned it was a key priority for Warren. ... In a brief phone interview, Schlapp asked for questions to be texted to him but did not respond to a text or a subsequent phone call.\"</p><p>             Irony alert: Warren is not actually a sponsor of the bill. She co-sponsored similar legislation in the last Congress, but there's no pending Senate bill pertaining to the tribe. \"It is also not lost on anybody that a lobbyist for the Rhode Island casino seems to have a very tight relationship with the White House,\" said Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), who represents the district where the new casino would go. \"It's sad. The consequence of this is going to be that the tribe that greeted the Pilgrims gets hurt once again by the U.S. government.\"</p><p>             -- Trump publicly endorsed a super PAC run by his allies, America First Action, after strenuously criticizing such groups during the 2016 election.Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \"In October 2015, then-candidate [Trump] railed against his opponents and the political committees raising huge sums to try and boot him out of the primaries. 'They're in total cahoots with their [super] PACs, which they're not allowed to be,' Trump\u00a0told The Washington Post\u00a0at the time. ... But on Tuesday, [Trump] made a sharp about-face ... Candidates and the independent super PACs that support them have increasingly found ways to work together without breaking laws barring outright coordination. But the Trump reelection campaign's statement appeared to go further than any other.\"</p><p>             -- \"The White House revoked my press pass. It's not just me - it's curtailing access for all journalists,\" by Post columnist Dana Milbank: \"For the past 21 years, I have had the high privilege of holding a White House press pass, a magical ticket that gives the bearer a front-row seat to history. ... But no more. The White House eliminated most briefings and severely restricted access to official events. And this week came the coup de grace: After covering four presidents, I received an email informing me that Trump's press office had revoked my White House credential. ... I strongly suspect it's because I'm a Trump critic.

Trump has also sought to blame Democrats for the lack of aid and has claimed Puerto Rico is undeserving of more federal funds to deal with the aftermath of devastating hurricanes in 2017. To illustrate his point, Trump pulled a small bar chart out of his suit coat and held it up to the crowd. Puerto Rico, he said, has received more relief money than any other state or territory, falsely claiming that the federal government had provided Puerto Rico with $91 billion in aid. 'That's Puerto Rico,' Trump said, pointing to the tallest bar.

Herndon and Jonathan Martin report: \"She has repeatedly sought to placate the left since setting her sights on the presidency - an impulse many in her orbit say is reinforced by her campaign chair, Maya Harris, her sister. At the same time, other Harris advisers and allies have winced at some of the senator's overtures to liberals ... But two recent events - Ms. Harris's insistent questioning of Mr. Barr at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, and [Biden's] multiday spat with Mr. Trump - have been clarifying moments for Ms. Harris and her aides, demonstrating the value of elevating her voice of opposition to the president and seeking direct confrontation with the White House, according to her advisers.\"</p><p>             -- Pete Buttigieg blindsided Harris in California, capturing the attention of state Democrats with ties to the LGBTQ and Hollywood communities.\u00a0Politico's Carla Marinucci reports: \"Democratic strategist Garry South says the growing buzz about Buttigieg's success in wedging his way into California's lucrative fundraising base has shocked many longtime politics watchers in the state.

A lot of Democrats look at Biden and think he would've won in 2016 and as such see him as the safest choice for 2020. If however, Biden starts to look like a risky bet (he stumbles in a debate, bumbles on the trail, etc) the rationale on which his campaign is based collapses. The winner of the 2020 primary will be the candidate who can prove he/she is best suited for the unique challenges of the upcoming campaign, not the one who is still fighting over what they should do the same/differently from 2016.\"</p><p>             -- Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz appears to be backing away from an independent presidential bid, fueling speculation that Biden's entry into the race has made him reconsider.The Daily Beast's Sam Stein and Gideon Resnick report: \"Erin McPike, a spokesperson for Schultz, said there was a simple reason for [recent] canceled events: he was 'taking a break while he is recovering from back surgery.' ... But Schultz has also dialed down the elements of his campaign prep that don't actually require public appearances. He has not posted to Facebook or Instagram since April 30. ...

Fake news,\" the president said, without being more specific.</p><p>But other news outlets have now matched the story, as well. \"A source close to the White House\" confirmed to <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>that Trump told officials he wanted to fire Mueller but was \"talked out of doing so\" by McGahn.</p><p>             Here are five takeaways from the latest bombshell:          </p><p>             1. Trying to fire Mueller is a data point that could be used to build a larger obstruction case.          </p><p>\"Amid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation,\" Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report on the front page of the Times, citing four sources. \"Mr. McGahn disagreed with the president's case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's presidency ... </nameText></person>Mr. McGahn was also concerned that firing the special counsel would incite more questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia investigation. ... After receiving the president's order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel ... refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead ...</p><p>\"Another option that Mr. Trump considered in discussions with his advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and elevating the Justice Department's No. 3 official, Rachel Brand, to oversee Mr. Mueller,\" per the Times. \"Mr. Mueller learned about the episode in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials in his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.\"</p><p>\"In the jigsaw puzzle of circumstantial evidence of criminal intent, these are more pieces that Mueller certainly would use,\" white-collar criminal defense attorney Jacob Frenkel, who previously worked in the Office of Independent Counsel, told one of my colleagues. \"You build it around the timing.\"</p><p>From a writer for the Atlantic:</p><p>A prominent Democratic lawyer:</p><p>             2. The White House's credibility gap has become a chasm.          </p><p>Many reporters no longer trust any official statements from the president or his spokespeople. This is the consequence of the White House repeatedly and vehemently denying stories, especially related to the Russia investigation, that are later proven true.</p><p>On Dec. 20, for example, White House lawyer Ty Cobb released a statement that said: \"For five months or more the White House has persistently and emphatically stated there is no consideration of firing the Special Counsel and the White House willingly affirms yet again, as it has every day this week, there is no consideration being given to the termination of the Special Counsel.\"</p><p>Derek Hawkins flags some other denials that have now been undercut:</p><p>Last August, two months after the events in question, Trump himself was asked whether he had considered firing Mueller. \"I haven't given it any thought,\" the president claimed during a news conference.</p><p>On ABC that same month, George Stephanopoulos asked White House counselor Kellyanne Conway whether the president would commit to not firing Mueller. \"The president has not even discussed that,\" she said. \"The president is not discussing firing Bob Mueller.\"</p><p>Also in August, USA Today asked Trump lawyer John Dowd if Trump might try to remove Mueller. \"That has never been on the table, never,\" Dowd replied. \"It's a manifestation of the media.\"</p><p>In October, during another news conference, Trump was again asked whether he ever considered firing Mueller. \"No, not at all,\" the president said.</p><p>\"As the White House has consistently said for months, there is no consideration of firing the special counsel,\" Cobb told CNN on Dec. 16.</p><p>\"There is no conversation about that whatsoever in the White House,\" Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, told NBC on Dec. 17.</p><p>The host of PBS NewsHour recalled another episode:</p><p>             3. This news will create fresh momentum for Congress to take up bipartisan bills to protect Mueller, even if GOP leadership continues to pigeonhole them.          </p><p>Republican Rep. Charlie Dent (Pa.) said last night that McGahn \"prevented an Archibald Cox moment.\"</p><p>\"I believe now that this revelation has been made public, that there will be increasing pressure to protect Mueller,\" Dent told Mike DeBonis.</p><p>Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) co-sponsored a bill last August with Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to create a judicial check on the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel. Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) introduced similar legislation. \"It's long past time congressional leaders allow members to vote on our legislation that checks the president's ability to remove a special counsel, ensuring that any removal is for legitimate reasons,\" Booker said in a statement. \u00a0</p><p>Blumenthal added:</p><p>             4. McGahn threatening to quit is a reminder that White House staffers do not need to enable Trump.          </p><p>They may serve at the pleasure of the president, but West Wing employees are still public servants. If Trump's interests and the national interest come into conflict, the oath they take requires them to put country first.</p><p>From a conservative lawyer who contributes to National Review:</p><p>A Harvard law professor and Hoover senior fellow who held top legal jobs under George W. Bush:</p><p>Hillary Clinton's former spokesman:</p><p>             Mueller's team has now interviewed more than 20 White House officials. Trump lawyer John Dowd put out a one-page memo yesterday to make the case that the administration is cooperating with Mueller: It said the White House has turned over 20,000 pages of documents, and the Trump campaign apparatus turned over an additional 1.4 million pages. Dowd said 17 campaign staffers - along with 11 individuals affiliated with the campaign - have now given interviews to Mueller's team and/or congressional committees, per Carol D. Leonnig.</p><p>             5. Managing Trump can be a herculean task for his top aides.          </p><p>             White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has worked to insulate Trump from outside advisers who might encourage his self-destructive instincts.Josh Dawsey, Robert Costa and Philip Rucker have a deep dive this morning on his approach and the ways the president sometimes bristles at it:</p><p>\"Kelly has slashed security clearances into the West Wing and reduced the number of people on the access list that once allowed relative free roaming within the White House ... People such as former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski have seen their access reduced ... After Lewandowski had a lengthy meeting at the White House with Kelly this month, he went to say hello to [McGahn] ... When Jim Carroll, a White House lawyer, saw Lewandowski sitting in the waiting area without an appointment with McGahn, he told the operative that he had to leave and offered to escort him out ...\"</p><p>\"Kelly brings fewer issues to the president than Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, did, and often will advise Trump of issues after they have been handled. He has curbed the role of the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, in the White House, aides say, and has at times questioned Ivanka Trump's work on Capitol Hill.</p><p>\"While the two men fight and swear at each other at times, Kelly sees Trump more than anyone else, and confidants say the volatility in their relationship is natural.</p><p>\"Trump has joked to associates that Kelly has cut his phone line, outside advisers said. He has told friends that he can come by 'only if the general approves.' And the president has complained that he never sees staff members anymore and occasionally sits in the office alone, aides said. ... One reason Trump stays in the personal residence section of the White House so late every morning - sometimes until after 10 a.m. - is because he has access to his phone and has fewer restrictions, associates say. Kelly has told others he is fine with such 'executive time,' as it is referred to on his schedule.</p><p>\"Trump critics have questioned whether Kelly's style of managing the president is always best. While he has sometimes kept bad information from getting to the president, he has also intervened to block bipartisan deals that Trump wanted to strike on immigration and reinforced some of the president's most contentious positions. Several of Trump's most controversial and racially incendiary moments - such as his remarks last summer after riots in Charlottesville and his recent disparaging comments about African nations - also came as Kelly looked on.\"</p><p>             -- This story is dominating every social media platform.

In some cases, Russians allegedly working in an office building in St. Petersburg motivated at least some people to mobilize behind various causes, a striking accomplishment for a foreign influence campaign.</p><p>             \"Facebook, which along with other big tech giants sought to downplay the Russian activity for months, declined to disclose a list of the 129 events publicized by the operatives. Previous disclosures by Facebook make clear that the operatives focused their disinformation campaigns on sensitive social issues, including racial and religious controversies, gun rights, police violence, southern heritage and immigration.\"</p><p>             \"Not only did they influence how people viewed Russian policy, they got people to take physical action. That's unprecedented,\" said Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent who studies Russian disinformation for the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \"They just did it persistently, and they did it well.\"</p><p>             MORE ON THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS:          </p><p>             -- The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to release transcripts of its interviews with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>Jr.\u00a0and other participants of the June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.Karoun Demirjian reports: \"Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said Thursday that the committee would start releasing 'all witness interviews that we have done related to that meeting' and 'get them out to the public for everyone to see,' as the panel's interviews with 'witnesses surrounding the Trump Tower meeting are complete.' A spokesman for the senator said that the transcripts must be redacted and that doing so will take time. It was not immediately clear when that process will be complete. Grassley later added that two of the five transcripts still require legal vetting. When he was asked whether public testimony from these people is now off the table, the senator said: 'I wouldn't say anything's off table, but not likely.'\"</p><p>             -- But even as he tries to wraps things, Grassley\u00a0acknowledged that a \"spooked\" Jared Kushner\u00a0refuses to voluntarily cooperate and won't come in for a staff interview.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Dianne\u00a0Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top\u00a0Democrat on the committee, said yesterday that the committee should still hold public hearings with Kushner and Trump Jr., \"which we agreed to pursue last year.\" (Bloomberg)</p><p>             -- The House Intelligence Committee released a transcript of its interview with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson,             whose firm was behind the infamous Trump-Russia dossier. Simpson requested that lawmakers make his remarks public earlier this month. \"Simpson spent much of the hearing describing his research into Trump's business background and litigation history,\" Politico reports. \"He also offered the committee several suggestions for avenues of further inquiry, including into the European travel of Trump associates. He also elaborated on his relationship with senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, whom Simpson met with at a coffee shop after the 2016 election to explain the dossier and ensure that senior law enforcement officials were aware of its findings.\"</p><p>             THE GOP CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE FBI:          </p><p>             -- Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) walked back his conspiracy theory that there is a \"secret society\" within the FBI. His claim\u00a0was debunked when the text message\u00a0he based it on\u00a0was leaked to\u00a0the press.The\u00a0Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports: \"Johnson acknowledged Thursday that his earlier statement ... may have been based on a joke within a single text message. 'I don't know,' Johnson [said]. 'It certainly could be.' But he stood by his central assertion that an informant told his committee that a group of FBI employees was having meetings outside of government offices. ... Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, sidestepped the criticisms by saying his panel would continue to look into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state and the FBI's 'scam investigation' into the matter.\"</p><p>             -- The Justice Department's inspector general says he has recovered five months of missing texts exchanged between two senior FBI officers, who were investigating both Trump and Clinton.Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report: \"In a letter to congressional leaders [on the Senate Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committee], Inspector General Michael Horowitz said his office 'succeeded in using forensic tools' to recover messages [sent by Peter Strzok and Lisa Page] .... The missing messages have sparked a political firestorm in recent days, as GOP leaders and the president himself have raised questions about how the FBI could have failed to retain them.\"</p><p>             -- Despite stern warnings from DOJ, House Intelligence Republicans appear ready to approve the\u00a0release of the \"memo\" crafted by GOP staffers for Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that purportedly documents\u00a0surveillance abuses by the intelligence community.Politico's Kyle Cheney contacted or reviewed statements by the committee's 13 Republicans and found near-unanimous support for making public the memo: \"A vote by the committee - expected as soon as Wednesday - to release the controversial document would put its fate into the hands of [Trump], who has not taken a clear position on its public disclosure. ... Democrats charge that Republicans are making an unprecedented push to declassify material for partisan gain, noting that the panel has never before voted to disclose classified information.\"          </p><p>             -- Just two of the nine Republicans on the committee would need to vote against the release to block the effort.\u00a0A few of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents in the country sit on the committee, including Elise Stefanik\u00a0from New York and Will Hurd\u00a0from Texas, and this could become an\u00a0issue in their races. The retiring Ileana Ros-Lehtinen\u00a0(Fla.) has also previously demonstrated a willingness to buck the Trump loyalists.</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) announced he will not seek reelection. Inappropriate behavior was recently exposed by the\u00a0Pennsylvania Republican toward\u00a0a longtime female aide, decades his junior, resulted in a congressional payout. Meehan\u00a0said in a letter that \"the settlement of certain harassment allegations\" had \"become a major distraction.\"</p><p>             \"I need to own it because it is my own conduct that fueled the matter,\" he wrote. \"It is clear to me, that under the current conditions, any campaign I would run would not be decided over vital issues but would likely devolve into an ugly spectacle of harsh rhetoric.\"</p><p>\"His decision to retire will come as a relief to Republican strategists, who questioned whether Republicans would have any chance to hold the suburban [Philadelphia] district with a politically wounded candidate,\" Mike DeBonis and Robert Costa report. \"Hillary Clinton won the district ... by 2 points. ... Meehan is the seventh member of the 115th Congress to retire or resign because of misconduct allegations.\"</p><p>             -- Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) will deliver the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address\u00a0next week.The Boston Globe's Victoria McGrane and Annie Linskey report: \"The choice thrusts the 37-year-old, three-term congressman from Brookline into the national spotlight more squarely than he has ever been before.

A member of Ike's own party, Sen. Robert Hendrickson (R-N.J.), grilled Charles Wilson about whether his decisions would be shaded by holding millions in stock of an automaker that had extensive government contracts. \"If a situation did arise where you had to make a decision which was extremely adverse to the interests of General Motors [but] in the interests of the United States government,\" the senator wondered, \"could you make that decision?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I cannot conceive of one,\" Wilson told the Armed Services Committee, \"because for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa. The difference did not exist. Our company is too big. It goes with the welfare of the country.\"</p><p>             Monday underscored that, perhaps now more than ever, what's good for GM is not necessarily what's good for America. The company announced that it will save $6 billion by eliminating 14,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce, and halting production next year at four U.S. plants, from Macomb County in Michigan to Trumbull County in Ohio, that make the Chevy Impala, Cruze and Volt, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse. But as 14,000 people and their families fretted looming unemployment, with Christmas just weeks away, investors celebrated. GM stock closed up 5 percent.</p><p>             This points to the growing disconnect between what's good for Wall Street and what's good for Main Street. That has fueled the inequality and polarization that are dividing the country - and helped facilitate for the ascendancy of President Trump.</p><p>             -- \"GM layoffs are another victory for capital over labor,\"Chris Ingraham notes on Wonkblog: \"As this chart from the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows, corporate profits and labor income - the total wages and salaries paid to American workers - tracked pretty closely for most of the latter half of the 20th century: In percentage terms, the two rose roughly in tandem from 1947 until about 2003 ... But starting in 2003, profits take off, leaving wages in the dust. The Great Recession took a bite out of corporate profits, but since about 2009, profits have been on an unstoppable tear while labor income has plodded along much more slowly. ... The American economy has been rewarding owners and shareholders much more richly than workers.\"</p><p>             \"Never have corporate profits outgrown employee compensation so clearly and for so long,\" the St. Louis Fed said in a report this summer.          </p><p>\"There are a lot of factors driving the divergence,\" Chris explains. \"Workers have become much more productive, contributing more and more to companies' bottom lines, but companies haven't been sharing those profits with the employees who make them possible. Union membership continues to decline, making it harder for workers to negotiate favorable terms of employment. In an era of rising health-care costs, companies are shifting more and more of that expense to workers.\"</p><p>             -- This growing disconnect between capital and labor is causing many Americans to lose faith in the economic system that made ours the most powerful country in the world. That, in turn, concerns many thoughtful people on the right and the left who love capitalism and want it to be sustainable over the long-term.</p><p>             One person who has grown alarmed that capitalism itself cannot survive without changes is Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.). The 38-year-old is political royalty. He's the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, the assassinated former attorney general. JK3, as he's known around the Capitol, earned his undergraduate degree from Stanford and then went to Harvard Law School, where Elizabeth Warren was a favorite professor, after two years in the Dominican Republic for the Peace Corps, which his great-uncle JFK created by executive order. He worked briefly as a county prosecutor before winning an open House seat in 2012.</p><p>After six years of keeping a relatively low profile in the minority, with the notable exception of delivering this year's Democratic response to the State of the Union, the young Kennedy feels ready to take on a bigger leadership role in the next Congress. He has ruled out a run for president in 2020, but he's closely allied himself with Nancy Pelosi and will benefit if she, as expected, regains the speaker's gavel. He's also better positioned than anyone else in Massachusetts to replace Warren in the Senate if she gives up her seat to become president.</p><p>Kennedy campaigned extensively for Democratic candidates across the country this fall, from Arizona and Texas to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, plus Minnesota and many more. On the stump, he said he saw the \"anger\" that powered Trump and picked up on \"a deep sense of unease that Americans are working harder and harder for less and less.\" The congressman tried to crystallize some of his observations in a speech Monday morning during a New England Council breakfast.</p><p>             \"American capitalism has done great good for a great number of people,\" he said. \"It has given our average citizen a better standard of living than anywhere else in the world, lifted millions out of poverty and powered the globe. But its current iteration is badly broken. The sooner we admit that, the sooner we can strip it to the studs and build something better.\"</p><p>             Kennedy advocated for a \"moral capitalism\" that would be \"judged not just by how much it produces, but how widely it shares; how good it does for how many; and how well it takes care of all of us.\" He believes it's imperative that House Democrats use their newfound majority to craft an agenda that \"lets our businesses thrive but our people breathe.\"</p><p>\"Our people need an alternative to the trickle-down, feed-the-top, if-you're-struggling-try-harder narrative that conservatives have masterfully entrenched in American consciousness, but for years, the left has failed to offer a competing - compelling - economic vision,\" said Kennedy. \"We'll have to do more than tax the rich to meet our needs in infrastructure, child care, health care, college and climate change.\"</p><p>             -- Kennedy said the left's failure to offer a competing vision to Reaganomics created the vacuum that has made socialism so alluring to many Democrats. For instance, the most famous incoming freshman, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), identifies as a democratic socialist. So does Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the runner-up for the party's nomination in 2016. \"Our country bears the scars of economic injustice on the left and the right, on the fringe and in the center,\" said Kennedy. \"We hear it in the demands of a new generation that feels socialism better speaks its language.\"</p><p>             A Gallup poll this summer found that more Democrats now have a positive view of socialism than capitalism by a margin of 57 percent to 47 percent. It didn't used to be that way. The number of Democrats viewing \"capitalism\" as a good thing has dipped nine points in just the past two years. Among all Americans, 56 percent saw capitalism positively in the Gallup survey versus 37 percent who said the same of socialism.</p><p>             Speaking of capitalism, Kennedy said: \"I believe in that system. Let me be clear.\" But he warned that the safety net is buckling under the pressure. \"And the average American family is left on its own, facing an economy they can't access, a government they can't depend on and a system they can't possibly afford,\" he continued. \"This is the injustice we have to solve not just because of some political map but because our system will not survive if we don't.\"</p><p>             Sounding very much like his famous grandfather did in Appalachia during the 1968 primaries, he noted that a full-time minimum wage worker can no longer afford a two-bedroom apartment in a single state. One in four American families skip doctor visits for fear of the bills that will follow. Low-income families spend half their monthly income on child care. And a quarter of workers make less than $10 an hour, putting them below the federal poverty line.</p><p>             \"Meanwhile the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of our country's wealth,\" he said. \"The average CEO makes 361 times what their average worker makes. Payouts to shareholders after the GOP tax bill will hit $1.3 trillion this year while wages still hover at the lowest they've been in over half a century. Even in Massachusetts - where we hold ourselves up as a beacon for progress and inclusion and equity - the top 1 percent of earners in Suffolk County make over 50 times more than the bottom 99 percent.\"</p><p>             Then, in a historical rarity, a Kennedy quoted Richard Nixon to make his point. When he was Ike's vice president in 1959, Nixon wound up shoulder to shoulder with Nikita Khrushchev at the American National Exhibition in Moscow. And they had an impromptu debate about which system - communism or capitalism - provided the greatest prosperity for its people. It played out while the men stood in the kitchen of a model American home, filled with everyday gadgets, that Nixon boasted any American family could afford. \"That was the point of pride,\" Kennedy explained. \"That was the barometer of economic success our country proudly offered the world. It was not based on summer homes or private jets or pricey schools but on a basic prosperity everyone could access.\"</p><p>             Kennedy said corporations began to break the social contract that was forged during and after World War II as \"they lurched towards self-preservation - cutting costs, wages, benefits and jobs.\" He complained that government assisted them by cutting corporate taxes, creating incentives to move production abroad, failing to block mergers that created monopolies, removing employer obligations to pension funds and weakening worker safety rules. \"Through deliberate choice and conscious action, we recalibrated the American economy -- away from workers, families and communities and toward capital, profit and shareholders,\" he said.</p><p>             He sees the GM news as more than just the consequence of one company's choices. \"It's the result of a system that has loosened the terms of its social contract 1,000 times, 1,000 ways over the past 50 years,\" he said last night.</p><p>             -- Trump identified many of the same problems as Kennedy when he sought the presidency, and he said addressing them would be a priority. But he's overpromised and underdelivered. On the eve of the election in 2016, Trump visited Warren, Mich., where a GM transmission plant will close next year. \"If I'm elected, you won't lose one plant,\" he told the crowd. \"I promise you that!\"</p><p>Visiting Youngstown last summer, a few miles from a Chevy plant that's going to close, Trump said: \"Let me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, don't sell your house! Do not sell it. We're going to get those values up. We're going to get those jobs coming back, and we're going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build new ones.\"</p><p>\u00a0-- Compare his rhetoric to the reality: \"Trade wars are good, and easy to win,\" Trump tweeted in March.</p><p>\"Raw-material costs have soared as a result of Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, with Ford saying it absorbed a $1 billion hit because of the president's policies,\" David Lynch and Taylor Telford report on the front page of today's newspaper. \"The new North American trade deal with Mexico and Canada includes sourcing requirements that will complicate industry supply chains, and the president also is considering imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles, a policy that would increase the cost of imported cars by an estimated $6,000 and eliminate 600,000 industry jobs, according to the American Automotive Policy Council. Philip Levy, a White House economist in the George W. Bush administration, said the auto industry layoffs could prompt Trump to go ahead with additional trade barriers. 'While he should take the GM move as a prompt to reconsider his approach, he seems much more inclined to double down reflexively,' Levy wrote in an email.\"</p><p>             -- At the White House on Monday, Trump told reporters that he complained directly to GM chief executive Mary Barra about the layoffs and closures. \"I was very tough,\" the president said. \"I said, 'You know, this country has done a lot for General Motors. You better get back in there soon.'\"</p><p>             He specifically singled out the plant in Ohio. Trump said he's pushing the company to repurpose the Lordstown plant, which makes the Chevy Cruze, so it can produce new vehicles. Back in May, I wrote a Big Idea about how that facility was losing its second shift partly as a result of Trump's decision to roll back EPA fuel standards. It was one illustration of the unintended consequences of the president's policies backfiring on people who supported him. Now the plant will close altogether.</p><p>             But Trump pledged on Monday that everything will work out. \"I have no doubt that, in a not-too-distant future, they'll put something else,\" he said. \"They better put something else in!\"</p><p>             -- Closing with some good news: The 202 franchise continues to grow.

Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Devlin Barrett report: \"Manafort denied doing so intentionally, but both sides agreed in a court filing that U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District should set sentencing immediately. The apparent collapse of Manafort's cooperation agreement is the latest stunning turnaround in his case, exposing the longtime Republican consultant to at least a decade behind bars after he pleaded guilty in September to charges of cheating the [IRS], violating foreign-lobbying laws and attempting to obstruct justice. The filing also indicated that Mueller's team may have lost its potentially most valuable witness in Manafort, a top campaign official present at discussions at the heart of the special counsel's mission to determine if any Americans conspired with Russia's efforts to sway the U.S. election. Still, prosecutors may know more about Manafort's interactions than he realized, allowing them to catch him in alleged lies.\"</p><p>             -- Jerome Corsi, a former associate of Trump ally Roger Stone, rejected a plea deal from Mueller's team - seemingly denying the special counsel another cooperating witness.Rosalind S. Helderman, Carol D. Leonnig and Manuel Roig-Franzia report: \"[Corsi said] he would have been forced to say untruthfully that he intentionally lied to investigators. In fact, Corsi said he was merely forgetful in his initial answers to Mueller's team about his interest in the activities of WikiLeaks, which released hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. His apparent rejection of a plea offer is the latest twist in a months-long effort by Mueller's team to secure the cooperation of the author and conspiracy theorist. ... In several interviews Monday, Corsi alleged that Mueller is trying to use him to build a case that a Trump associate coordinated with WikiLeaks. ...</p><p>\"In his sessions with Mueller's team, prosecutors seized on inconsistencies between his statements and emails, Corsi told The Washington Post. He said he first told investigators that he never encouraged anyone to go see [WikiLeaks founder Julian] Assange in the summer of 2016. However, Corsi told The Post, he amended his testimony after Mueller's investigators allowed him to refresh his memory and review his emails, which were housed on a laptop he had provided under a subpoena.</p><p>...\u00a0Corsi told The Post that after reviewing his emails, he realized that between July 2016 and August 2016 he had offered to go visit Assange in the Ecuadoran embassy             if his then-boss, WorldNetDaily editor in chief Joseph Farah, purchased him a plane ticket to London. Corsi said he also forwarded to his friend Ted Malloch an email in which Corsi said Stone urged that someone 'get to Assange' immediately. ... Stone confirmed Monday that he emailed Corsi to suggest that Malloch meet with Assange. ... Stone said the exchange ... supports his claim that he had no advance knowledge of the impending WikiLeaks releases. 'Why would I be asking for something I already had?' Stone said.\"</p><p>             -- Trump appeared to preemptively attack any report from Mueller's team by going after the special counsel himself. \"When Mueller does his final report, will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble?\"\u00a0Trump wrote on Twitter,\u00a0providing no examples. \"Will he be putting in statements from hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met, saw or spoke to a Russian during this period?\"</p><p>             -- One of Trump's judicial nominees who has been criticized for his stance on voting rights is teetering on the brink of Senate rejection.Politico's Marianne Levine and Burgess Everett report: \"Thomas Farr can lose only one additional Senate vote in his bid to be a District Judge in North Carolina after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) reiterated Monday that he would vote against Farr's nomination if Republican leadership did not bring to a vote legislation to protect [Mueller].\u00a0... That leaves Republicans no margin for error in the narrowly divided Senate, since all 49 Democrats are opposed to the nomination. Democrats said privately they believed that Sens.

Desperation there could leave U.S. border agents facing volatile crowds in two locations. On Monday, critics of the Trump administration denounced border agents' use of force on groups that included families with children, but U.S. officials praised what they called 'quick and effective action' against crowds of stone-slinging young men who pried open the border fence at multiple locations to squeeze through.\"</p><p>             -- Trump suggested without evidence that some of the migrants who were tear-gassed were \"grabbers\" who had used other people's children to protect themselves.Philip Rucker and Felicia Sonmez report: \"Earlier Monday, Trump denied that women and children were among those affected by the tear gas. But in his remarks to reporters here, he shifted his response, first claiming that the tear gas was 'very safe,' then blaming migrants with children for being in harm's way and finally questioning whether the children were theirs at all.\"</p><p>             -- Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen echoed Trump's claims by alleging migrants were using women and children as \"human shields.\" \"It appears in some cases that the limited number of women and children in the caravan are being used by the organizers as 'human shields' when they confront law enforcement,\" she said\u00a0in a statement. \"They are being put at risk by the caravan organizers as we saw at the Mexico-Guatemala border.

'I felt sad, I was scared. I wanted to cry. That's when I grabbed my daughters and ran,' Meza [said]. 'I thought my kids were going to die with me because of the gas we inhaled.' The photo, taken by Kim Kyung-Hoon of Reuters, shows the single mother running from the gas in the Tijuana River bed, clutching her twin daughters' arms.\"</p><p>             -- The clashes between immigration officials and caravan members could become a critical test as Trump prepares to fight for\u00a0funding for his border wall.From David Nakamura: \"Trump's presidency is shaping up as a crucible to test the belief among border hawks that an all-consuming focus on enforcement and deterrence will drive down illegal immigration more effectively than other ideas from moderates and liberals, including additional legal pathways for migrants to remain in the country. ... The violent clashes at the border between San Diego and Tijuana over the weekend represent the third major inflection point in the Trump administration's shock-and-awe enforcement strategy - after the limitations of the travel ban and the failure of a family separation policy.\"</p><p>             -- Republican leadership is struggling to balance Trump's border-wall demands with the deals they previously struck with Democrats.Politico's John Bresnahan, Burgess Everett and Sarah Ferris report: \"Senate GOP leaders have discussed with the president the possibility of providing Trump with $5 billion in guaranteed money for the wall but spread over two years, according to two Republicans familiar with internal discussions. Trump has not ruled out the idea, according to a Republican senator, but it's unclear whether Democrats will go along with that minor concession. ... There's still no clear way out of a bipartisan jam: Republicans promised Trump that they would fight for his wall money after the election. And Democrats say they already have a deal on $1.6 billion in border security, far less than the $5 billion preferred by the president and his allies in Congress.\"</p><p>             -- Senate Republicans are considering making changes to the chamber's bipartisan criminal justice bill, potentially jeopardizing its passage.Seung Min Kim reports: \"The changes being mulled, confirmed by senators and others familiar with the talks, reflect in part proposals put forward by the National Sheriffs' Association, which is opposed to the legislation as written. Though a slew of law enforcement groups already support the bill, getting more of them on board is almost certain to improve its prospects among Republicans. One change that has been discussed privately is tightening the 'safety valve' provision, which provides more discretion to judges when they issue sentences.\"</p><p>             THE MISSISSIPPI RUNOFF:          </p><p>             -- Democrats hope energized turnout among Mississippi's black voters will allow Senate candidate Mike Espy to pull off an unexpected upset in today's runoff.Matt Viser and David Weigel report: \"The state's long struggle with racism has emerged as an unavoidable theme, with two nooses found outside the state Capitol on Monday morning. But African Americans make up a larger share of the electorate here than they do in any other state, and in recent days, Espy and groups backing him have flooded the state with volunteers, radio ads and social media posts - seeking out potential voters in churches and on historically black college campuses.\"</p><p>             Trump visited the state last night for two rallies to support GOP\u00a0Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith: \"Trump's presence highlighted the divisions of the race, as well as the broader fault lines of American politics that have grown more intense over this year's midterms. As the president spoke before largely white crowds, Espy headlined a black church event here in the state capital called the 'Rise Above Rally and Gospel Explosion,' with passionate prayers, loud music and frequent references to 'Senator Espy.' ... But the president on Monday sought to portray Espy as the one who is out of step with modern-day Mississippi. 'How does he fit in with Mississippi?' Trump asked. 'How does he fit in?'\"</p><p>             -- Trump's rallies underscored GOP anxiety about winning the seat.From Philip Rucker: \"By yoking himself with Hyde-Smith, Trump is backing a politician who said she would sit with a supporter in the front row of a public hanging, donned a Confederate uniform to promote tourism at Jefferson Davis's homestead, and graduated from one segregation academy while sending her daughter to another. 'Race is always the key in which life in Mississippi is played,' said Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist and Mississippi native who wrote a book about growing up here. 'It's just always present and it is the greatest determinant, still, in Mississippi of one's path through life.' ...

But hurdles still remain for her to recapture the gavel (though she's very likely to be renominated by her caucus in party elections today).Mike DeBonis and Robert Costa report: \"Rep.-elect Gil Cisneros (Calif.) said Monday that he was joining 15 other Democrats who are calling for fresh leadership, saying that 'it's time for a new generation to rise'\u00a0- and that Pelosi, the House minority leader, is not part of the equation. Cisneros's opposition came hours after one of the leaders of the resistance, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), signaled he was open to negotiations about changes to Pelosi's leadership team - a retreat from his previous demand that Pelosi step aside. Meanwhile, Pelosi (D-Calif.) faced another challenge from a group of nine centrist Democrats from the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus who renewed a vow to oppose her unless she agrees to rule changes aimed at easing cross-aisle legislating. ...</p><p>\"The flurry of developments underscored two running themes in House Democratic politics following this month's sweeping gains in the midterm elections: Pelosi has deep and wide support among her colleagues and the party at large, but she still faces doubts from incoming freshmen who faced Pelosi-themed attacks in the campaign as well as disgruntled incumbents unwilling to pass up the opportunity to install new leaders.\"</p><p>             -- Pelosi has not indicated a willingness to negotiate with Moulton or consider removing either of her top deputies, Reps. Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Jim Clyburn (S.C.).From Costa: \"Still, associates of Moulton, 40, said he is hoping to sit down with Pelosi to discuss possible terms for the support of his group, in particular possibly rallying behind a younger member to be House majority leader or House majority whip, with an emphasis on bringing in a new generation to the leadership in the wake of the Democrats' sweeping gains in the midterm elections.\"</p><p>             -- The centrist group No Labels has been privately pushing for Pelosi's ouster.The Daily Beast's Sam Stein and Lachlan Markay report: \"Behind the scenes, No Labels and its leader, political strategist Nancy Jacobson, have been more skeptical of Pelosi and more willing to try and marginalize her among her members. [Internal emails] show that No Labels leadership contemplated a campaign to attack Pelosi aggressively after the primary campaign of centrist Rep. Dan Lipinski, who faced a primary challenge this year from Marie Newman, a progressive political neophyte. ... Pelosi had endorsed Lipinski. But No Labels leadership was convinced that her support was a fig leaf.

Speaking in Salt Lake City on Monday, Love said she was taken aback by Trump's 'jab' at her. 'The president's behavior towards me made me wonder: What did he have to gain by saying such a thing about a fellow Republican?' Love said. She said Trump's comments 'gave me a clear vision of his world as it is: no real relationships, just convenient transactions. That is an insufficient way to implement sincere service and policy.' Love, an African American, continued: 'This election experience and these comments shines a spotlight on the problems Washington politicians have with minorities and black Americans - it's transactional, it's not personal.\"</p><p>             -- Democrat T.J.

The latest figures mark a turnaround from election night, when Valadao was ahead by nearly 4,400 votes and the Associated Press projected that victory was in the Republican's hands.

With just weeks remaining in his congressional job, O'Rourke had already made clear that he intends to remain a part of the national conversation, penning occasional online essays, including\u00a0a piece Sunday critiquing [Trump's] treatment of asylum seekers on the southern border. 'We can either give into the fear of walls and tear-gassing children in diapers,' he told the crowd of more than 120 Monday, at his first public event since losing the election.

His campaign launch, on a grassy slope outside the sheriff's East Los Angeles station last year, was sparsely attended. ... But the dark horse candidate used the county's political mood to his advantage, experts said, trumpeting his status as a Democrat and claiming he would be the first Democratic sheriff in the county in 138 years.

'Sounds like a great deal for the EU,' the president said. 'I think we have to take a look at, seriously, whether or not the UK is allowed to trade. Because, you know, right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us ... And, hopefully, she'll be able to do something about that.'

I'm always busy doing a lot. Now I'm more busy, I guess, than ever before,\" President Trump told The Washington Post in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead\" is not the kind of tell-all that many of Trump's critics hoped for. But there are already plenty of those for sale. Nine months after he resigned in protest, Mattis remains unwilling to speak candidly about his 712 days as secretary of defense. Instead, the book is entirely a memoir about four decades as an officer in the Marine Corps - with references to Trump only in the first and final pages. The book is chock full, however, of implicit and illuminating contrasts between Mattis's management style and Trump's.</p><p>             There were no shelves of books in his office at Trump Tower. Meanwhile, Mattis amassed a private collection of more than 7,000 books, despite deployments around the world. \"Reading sheds light on the dark path ahead,\" he explains. \"By traveling into the past, I enhance my grasp of the present.\"</p><p>In a series of interviews with my colleague Marc Fisher three years ago, Trump was adamant that he does not need to read extensively because he reaches the right decisions \"with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words 'common sense,' because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability.\"</p><p>Trump also insisted that he does not need to read anything that's long because he absorbs complex issues quickly. \"I'm a very efficient guy,\" he said. \"Now, I could also do it verbally, which is fine. I'd always rather have - I want it short. There's no reason to do hundreds of pages because I know exactly what it is.\"</p><p>             Mattis, who prefers the nickname \"Warrior Monk\" to \"Mad Dog,\" repeatedly leans on his bibliomania throughout his 300-page book. The book reads like a literature review at times, as the 68-year-old recommends dozens of titles and name-checks too many authors to mention here. He also makes time to mock the scholars who said after the Cold War that it was \"the end of history.\"</p><p>             The way some people prepare for a marathon, Mattis challenges himself intellectually by picking some battle or area of history where he's weak. Then he fixates on the subject and reads everything he can find until he feels like an expert. \"Living in history builds your own shock absorber, because you'll learn that there are lots of old solutions to new problems,\" he explains. \"Strategy is hard, unless you're a dilettante. You must think until your head hurts.\"</p><p>             On Fox News in May 2016, Megyn Kelly asked Trump to name the last book he read. \"Oh, no, it's so long, because now I read passages,\" he replied. \"I just don't have the time. ... I would love to sit down and read a book, but I just don't have the time anymore.\"</p><p>The 73-year-old does, however, seem to have lots of time to watch television. And play golf. And tweet.</p><p>             Mattis is partial to studying Roman generals and historians, from Marcus Aurelius and Scipio Africanus to Tacitus. \"I followed Caesar across Gaul,\" he writes wistfully. \"I marveled at how the plain prose of [Ulysses] Grant and [William Tecumseh] Sherman revealed the value of steely determination. ... Biographies of ... Native American leaders, of wartime political leaders and sergeants, and of strategic thinkers from Sun Tzu to Colin Gray have guided me through tough challenges.\"</p><p>             Mattis argues that intellectual rigor is just as important as physical rigor to excel in his beloved corps. He remembers a grueling jog from decades ago on a sweltering day with an Israel exchange officer in the Virginia woods, probably at Quantico. \"Read the ancient Greeks and how they turned out their warriors,\" the Israeli bellowed. So he did.</p><p>Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked Trump in 2017 what he reads at night. The president replied that he had a copy of an Andrew Jackson biography, whose estate he was poised to visit in Tennessee, but he was too distracted to get into it. \"Every time I do about half a page, I get a phone call that there's some emergency, this or that,\" Trump said. \"I don't get to read very much, Tucker, because I'm working very hard on lots of different things, including getting costs down. The costs of our country are out of control.\"</p><p>             The president's disinterest in reading books is historically unusual. Barack Obama still occasionally shares reading lists on his Facebook page. During his second term, George W. Bush competed with Karl Rove to see who could polish off the most books each year. As president, Trump regularly plugs hagiographies about himself on Twitter, but there's no indication he's read them.</p><p>             Trump's dearth of historical knowledge has almost certainly played a role in the biggest miscalculations of his administration, especially the fateful decision to launch a trade war against China that he promised the American people would be quick and easy to win. Lack of elementary knowledge about Asian history also contributed to his naive approach toward Kim Jong Un and North Korea.</p><p>             On the other hand, Mattis has been keenly interested in Asian military history since he was a young infantry officer. On a live-fire range in the Philippines while he was still in his 20s, one of his company commanders recommended that he read \"Lee's Lieutenants\" by Douglas Freeman and \"Strategy,\" by Liddell Hart. Another time, while he was still a lieutenant, Mattis was training in the jungles of northern Okinawa. On a Saturday morning, his sergeant major gave him a book about a Roman centurion. \"It would be best if you did your homework first,\" Mattis remembers the sergeant, whom he technically outranked but had far more battlefield experience, telling him.</p><p>Formulating plans for invading Afghanistan in 2001, Mattis read about the British experience in Burma. He was especially interested in the Chindits, a long-range penetration force led by Brigadier General Orde Wingate in 1943 that successfully projected forces behind enemy lines.</p><p>             The Marine Corps maintains a list of required reading for every rank. Mattis, who was assisted in writing the book by Marine veteran Bing West, said this common core curriculum proved critical as he rose in the ranks because he could comfortably cite specific examples of how fighting forces had faced similar challenges in previous eras, knowing that his troops would understand what he was referencing. \"This provided my lads with a mental model as we adapted to our specific mission,\" he explains. \"Slowly but surely, we learned there was nothing new under the sun: properly informed, we weren't victims - we could always create options.\"</p><p>             The book showcases a multitude of moments that an institutional insistence on studying history paid off for Mattis and his Marines. During the first Gulf War, Mattis adapted a technique used by Roman legions, which built rectangular camps. He organized his camp in a triangular shape so that every man knew where he fit. \"The triangle always pointed north toward the enemy,\" Mattis remembers. \"We continued this routine for months, sleeping on the ground without cots. At night we sat together like Horatio Nelson's lieutenants, arguing tactics by moving rocks to simulate units. ...</p><p>\"Sitting on sand dunes, I pulled out books I carried in my rucksack that revealed how others had handled desert warfare,\" he adds. \"Using a technique I had found in my reading, I intended to gather information that bypassed normal reporting channels by means of 'focused telescopes.' I copied this from Frederick the Great, Wellington, and Rommel, among others.\"</p><p>             Erwin Rommel, a Nazi general, isn't the only American adversary Mattis learned from. In 1991, Mattis's battalion captured an Iraqi major who spoke English and tutored him on the way that army used \"skip-echelon techniques\" to cut down on staff size. In Afghanistan, a decade later, Mattis emulated this so that he could keep his staff as small as possible. He pared down a brigade that could have had a staff of over 200 to only 32, something he's immensely proud of.</p><p>In late spring 2002, Mattis was promoted to a two-star general. He took command of the 1st Marine Division and was ordered to prepare to go to war in Iraq. Mattis writes that the idea of invading Iraq \"stunned\" him. \"Even assuming he had chemical weapons, I believed we had him boxed in with our daily combat air patrols and sanctions against his oil exports,\" he volunteers. \"Having served 20 years in the region, I knew that [Saddam Hussein's] hatred of Iran worked to our strategic advantage.\"</p><p>             But Mattis said his commanding officer told him that his job was to get 22,000 troops ready for combat, regardless of whether he thought it was a good idea. That night, he remembers, \"I dumped my gear in my quarters, pulled books off the shelves, and began studying campaigns in Mesopotamia, starting with Xenophon's 'Anabasis' and books on Alexander the Great - working my way forward.\"</p><p>             His division deployed to Kuwait. As they waited around for the president to issue the go order, Mattis ate MREs and devoured books to prepare mentally for war. \"Marcus Aurelius's 'Meditations' was my constant companion. His advice kept me dispassionate in some of the most infuriating planning conferences,\" Mattis remembers. \"'The Siege,' by Russell Braddon, described a British defeat in Iraq in World War I on the same ground I'd be fighting through. Of course, T.E. Lawrence's classic 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom': few Westerners in recent history had achieved his level of trust with Arabs on the battlefield.\"</p><p>             Mattis studied Sherman's March to the Sea at the end of the Civil War, looking for insight on how \"to always keep enemies on the horns of a dilemma, left or right, front or back.\" He also read a biography of Gertrude Bell, who helped create modern Iraq. \"I'm an opportunistic learner,\" he explains. \"I may not have come up with many new ideas, but I've adopted or integrated a lot from others.\"</p><p>             After the invasion, Mattis's headquarters wound up being only 500 meters from where Alexander the Great laid in state in Babylon. He laments in the book that much of the trouble that followed in the occupation would have been foreseeable, and even avoidable, if political decisionmakers had studied the British occupation of Iraq after World War I and the French battle for Algiers in 1956 the way that he had.</p><p>             Mattis also reveals that he opposed the initial battle for Fallujah after private contractors were publicly executed, recalling a book he read about the 1968 Marine battle in Hue, Vietnam. But he was ordered to proceed any way by Bush political appointees. In the face of grim images and public backlash, Mattis was then ordered to stop the fighting. \"If you're going to take Vienna, take ... Vienna,\" he snapped, using profanity, at a general who came to his forward operating base to deliver the directive from Washington. \"I was repeating Napoleon's outburst to his field marshal who had hesitated to seize that city,\" Mattis notes.</p><p>             Later in the book, Mattis criticizes Obama and Joe Biden for being soft on Iran and too eager to get out of Iraq. Mattis was pushed out as the head of Central Command by the Obama administration because of his hawkishness toward Tehran, though he didn't want Trump to pull out of the nuclear agreement.</p><p>             Another theme that has long preoccupied Mattis is battlefield communication in the fog of war. Viscount Slim, a British field commander in Southeast Asia during World War II, wrote in his memoir \"Defeat into Victory\" about various methods he used to direct units that were faraway and in deep jungles, out of radio contact for days or weeks. One approach was to explain his broader intentions to junior officers so that they would understand the strategy when they needed to make decisions outside the chain of command. Mattis took this to heart.</p><p>             He also enjoys fiction. Sitting in combat zones, Mattis recalled scenes from \"The Killer Angels,\" Michael Shaara's historic novel about Gettysburg, and Dante's \"Inferno.\"</p><p>             The general even recommended to his Marines that they read poetry. \"Other men's flowers,\" an anthology by Lord Wavell, is one of his personal favorites. Trump does not read poetry.</p><p>             The love of reading dates to his childhood. Mattis said he grew up in Richland, Wash., with a well-stocked home library, \"instead of a television.\" As a boy, he remembers devouring young adult titles like \"Treasure Island,\" \"Captains Courageous,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" \"Call of the Wild\" and \"Swiss Family Robinson.\" Ernest Hemingway was his favorite childhood author, followed closely by William Faulkner and F.

Although Dorian is no longer the Category 5 powerhouse it was on Labor Day, it has grown in size, and it's capable of moving more water toward the shore than a smaller storm of similar intensity.

The storm's growing wind field is capable of producing a damaging storm surge along the coasts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and hurricane warnings and watches have been hoisted from the Florida coastline northward to the North CarolinaOuter Banks.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) held a campaign event today inside the Georgia State Capitol to protest the flurry of antiabortion bills that have been passing in red states - and unveil new campaign promises to protect Roe v. Wade.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gillibrand - who announced last week that she would only appoint judges who will uphold Roe - vowed to turn the landmark 1973 case into a permanent law if she's elected president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She pledged to \"make sure that every woman in America, no matter what state she lives in or how much money she has in her pocket, can have guaranteed access to safe, legal abortion.\"</p><p>Gillibrand went even further: She would seek to guarantee access to the procedure in every state by requiring private insurance companies to cover abortions and creating a federal authority to oversee state restrictions on the procedure. And she wants to end the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal funds including Medicaid to pay for abortions.</p><p>Condemning the \"nationwide assault on women's constitutional rights,\" Gillibrand told a group of protesters that the fight for abortion access would have to be waged everywhere -- from the courts to statehouses to Congress.\u00a0</p><p>She also called out President Trump by name for nominating \"anti-choice extremists\" to the Supreme Court. \"That is why we must come together to declare that reproductive rights are human rights,\" Gillibrand said. \"They are civil rights, and they are non-negotiable.\"</p><p>             Gillibrand, in\u00a0an interview yesterday before traveling to Georgia, promised to be a leader on this issue. \"I'm going to Atlanta to lead the fight against these unbelievable, draconian inhumane abortion bans,\" she said. \"As I've watched this, I have become more and more concerned that we not only need to shine a light on it and lift up the voices of women who will be impacted, but that I have to lead this fight. So I'm going to take it right to the lion's gate. I'm going to take it right to the belly of the beast.\"</p><p>Georgia's governor signed a bill last week that would outlaw abortion after a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected - which usually happens about six weeks following conception, before many women even realize they are pregnant. Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio have recently passed similar measures.</p><p>Missouri's state Senate passed a bill early this morning that would ban abortions after eight weeks. The GOP-controlled House is expected to pass it swiftly, and the Republican governor says he's waiting with pen in hand to sign it. The bill makes no exceptions for rape or incest.</p><p>Gillibrand's visit to Georgia also came the morning after Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in neighboring Alabama signed the most restrictive abortion law in the country. Doctors could be imprisoned for up to 99 years if they perform an abortion. Likewise, there are no exceptions for women who were raped or the victims of incest.</p><p>             -- Gillibrand, who met\u00a0with abortion providers, activists and state legislators before giving her\u00a0speech,             said most Democrats have become more direct when talking about reproductive rights than they were a few years ago. There's less throat clearing than there used to be. Very few politicians use the \"safe, legal, and rare\" talking point that was so standard during the Bill Clinton era.</p><p>             \"As a party, we should be 100 percent pro-choice, and it should be nonnegotiable,\" Gillibrand said in our interview. \"We should not settle for less, and if our party cannot support women's basic human rights, their fundamental freedoms to make decisions about their bodies and their futures, then we are not the party of women. ... I will not compromise on women's reproductive freedom.\"</p><p>             The senator attributes the more strident tone to the fact that more women are participating in politics, and they are more passionate about protecting their rights than the men who used to call the shots in the party. \"I think women's voices are being heard now more than ever,\" said Gillibrand. \"Women are feeling self-empowered. I don't think they're going to take excuses anymore, and I don't think they're going to support candidates that don't believe they should get to make those fundamentally personal decisions.\"</p><p>             To break through in such a crowded field, other presidential candidates have also centered their campaigns on one overarching issue. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee talks nonstop about combating climate change. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) focuses on gun control. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang's big idea is a universal basic income. For spiritual guru Marianne Williamson, it's reparations for the descendants of slaves. For Bernie Sanders, it always comes back to Medicare-for-all. For Elizabeth Warren, it's using a 2 percent wealth tax on everyone worth more than $50 million to pay for a battery of ambitious new programs, including universal child care.</p><p>             But no one else is talking about reproductive rights nearly as much or as forcefully as Gillibrand. She said that abortion comes up constantly on the campaign trail and has \"in every state I've visited.\" All the major 2020 contenders spoke out yesterday against the new laws in Alabama, Georgia and elsewhere, but Gillibrand is the first to travel to the region specifically to emphasize her opposition.</p><p>             \"Young women are deeply concerned because their lives are at risk,\" she said. \"This is their ability to control their bodies, their basic human rights, their basic civil rights as individuals to decide when they're having children, how many children they're having and whether they will have them safely. These are issues that are life-and-death issues for women, and they should not be demeaned and undermined so much that they're not allowed to make these most personal decisions themselves.\"</p><p>             -- Gillibrand caused ripples when she\u00a0announced last week that, if elected, she will appoint only judges who will uphold Roe. She notes that these states have all been controlled by Republicans for years, but they're passing these laws now in direct response to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. He replaced Anthony Kennedy, who provided the decisive fifth vote that preserved Roe v. Wade in the 1992 case of Casey v. Planned Parenthood. Antiabortion activists are confident, based on his track record as a judge on the D.C. Circuit and as a conservative legal activist, that he'll be with them when it counts.</p><p>             Trump pledged in 2016 that he would appoint only antiabortion justices to the Supreme Court. He said his appointees would \"automatically\" overturn Roe. At one point, he even said that women should be punished for seeking abortions before walking that back. Putting out lists of judges he would consider for the Supreme Court helped gin up turnout among social conservatives who were otherwise skeptical of him. In a close election, anything can be called pivotal. But it doesn't seem like a stretch to say that this might have been decisive.</p><p>In their futile efforts to stop the confirmation of his judicial nominees through the GOP-controlled Senate, Democrats have relentlessly attacked Trump for promising he would appoint only antiabortion judges. I pressed Gillibrand on whether her litmus test is therefore hypocritical. Her answer essentially boiled down to the fact that Trump broke the dam, and there's no going back now. Gillibrand, a lawyer by training, nodded to the importance of judicial independence. But she essentially argues that the high court has already become politicized and wonders why Democrats would maintain the fiction that justices are somehow impartial when it comes to one of the most charged issues in society. She believes that voters have a right to know with certainty that who they're supporting for president will appoint judges who will take a certain position on abortion.</p><p>\"First of all, the fact is that President Trump has made it his mission to overturn Roe v. Wade,\" Gillibrand said. \"He's changed the entire landscape of the judicial system. Certainly, Mitch McConnell did that by stealing the Merrick Garland seat. It's a new level of threat, and it is not a drill. It's something that every American woman, and every American family that cares about women, should be well aware of.\"</p><p>             -- Gillibrand's liberal colleagues in the Senate are stopping short of saying they'll impose this kind of litmus test on judicial nominees. Campaigning in New Hampshire yesterday, for instance, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) would only go so far as to say that upholding Roe would be a \"significant factor\" in her deliberations. The former California attorney general also said that she would consider adding as many as four more seats to the Supreme Court to change the balance of power while expressing interest in imposing term limits on justices and limiting the number of nominees any particular president gets to pick. \"I'm open to this conversation about increasing the number of people on the United States Supreme Court,\" she said.</p><p>             Gillibrand defended herself by noting that it's not unreasonable to demand that judges uphold precedent. \"Every single one of those justices said that they would hold up precedent. I'm concerned they lied, and I'm concerned they won't,\" she said. \"So I'm going to be very direct: I believe in precedent, I believe in the precedent of Roe v. Wade, and any judge that I will nominate to be a Supreme Court justice or to be a judge on any court will be a pro-choice judge who will uphold the precedent of Roe v. Wade.\"</p><p>             The senator sees much of the energy on her side in the abortion debate as stemming from Trump's 2016 victory, despite the \"Access Hollywood\" video, and the #MeToo movement that's followed. \"A lot of this rebirth of the women's movement is a direct response to electing President Trump, who has more than a dozen sexual assault allegations against him and clearly doesn't value women and particularly women of color,\" she said. \"They've been fighting and marching since President Trump became president. You saw it in the women's marches globally, and then you saw it again in 2018 with the number of women who ran and won and voted. I think everything is changing, and it's changing in the red places and the purple places. Our breakthrough elections were all in the red and purple districts and with purple state governors.\" (Trump has denied all the allegations of sexual misconduct.)</p><p>             Gillibrand highlighted the victories of Democratic women in the midterms like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan. Whitmer has promised to veto bills that passed Michigan's legislature on Tuesday to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure. The bills would prohibit physicians from performing abortion by dilation and evacuation except to save a woman's life.</p><p>             -- The senator says that these debates allow female candidates to make the case that there should be more women at the table. In Alabama, all 25 of the votes that were cast in favor of the abortion bill in the state Senate were from white Republican men. Women account for 51 percent of Alabama's population but hold only 15 percent of the seats in the state legislature. In Georgia, women hold 72 of the 236 seats in the state legislature. That's just less than a third.</p><p>             \"It's vital because most men, particularly white men, cannot imagine what it would be like to not have full constitutional rights and full freedoms,\" Gillibrand said. \"They can't possibly imagine someone else telling them about how many children they're going to have and what's going to happen to their body in a life-or-death situation whether you are going to have a child. I don't think men in America can fully understand what it's like to be told your body is not your own. And that some legislator from far away who knows nothing about you gets to make that decisions. Having a child is a serious, not risk-free, decision. There's a lot of maternal mortality in this country. Women sometimes have very hard pregnancies.\"</p><p>             -- To be sure, it's not just the Democratic women who are stopping abortion bills. The Wisconsin State Assembly yesterday passed a bill addressing what happens during the rare situation when a baby is born alive during a failed abortion attempt. But Gov. Tony Evers (D), who defeated Scott Walker in November, has promised to veto the measure when it passes the GOP-controlled state Senate. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, has also pledged to veto a bill that passed the state House on Tuesday to outlaw abortions because of a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome.</p><p>             -- Last year's General Social Survey showed that 2 in 3 Democrats said a woman should be able to have an abortion for any reason, compared with 35 percent of Republicans. A Pew poll published last September found that 58 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in at least most cases, compared with 37 percent who said it should be illegal in all or most cases. That top-line number has stayed consistent over the past few decades, though other polling shows that most Americans shy away from absolutism on both sides of the abortion debate.</p><p>             -- While the national debate has sharpened and polarized, by no means do all Democratic politicians support abortion rights. Especially in the South. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who is up for reelection in November, has indicated he will sign a \"heartbeat bill\" that's moving quickly through the state legislature that prohibits abortion as early as the sixth week of a pregnancy. The bill, introduced by a Democrat, passed out of the state House's health committee yesterday without objections. It's written so that it can go into effect only if a federal appellate court upholds a nearly identical law in Mississippi. That's designed to minimize litigation costs for the state.</p><p>             -- But there are also Democratic officeholders in red states who are taking a stand against the post-Kavanaugh laws. The Democratic district attorney of Salt Lake County in Utah, for example, announced yesterday afternoon that he will not enforce an 18-week ban that was just enacted statewide. The two abortion clinics in the state are both in his jurisdiction. District Attorney Sim Gill said he thinks the law is unconstitutional, so prosecuting doctors who perform abortions would be inappropriate.</p><p>             -- These latest bills are pushing the debate toward territory where Democrats can more clearly prevail politically. \"Until recently, Republicans have been on offense on the issue of abortion, deploying a similar playbook to the one Democrats are now using by calling their opponents extreme due to a recent law passed in New York that expanded access to abortions late in a pregnancy,\" Michael Scherer and Felicia Sonmez report. \"In his State of the Union address this year, Trump pointed to the New York law and comments by Virginia Gov.

The companies agreed to accelerate research and information sharing with governments in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. ...

'Little t' twttr is a part of the company's grand plan to treat the platform's underlying issues, rather than just its symptoms. The idea is that what it learns from small-t twttr will help big Twitter foster conversations, rather than outrage. ... The twttr team began by testing what happens if the app more clearly shows who's replying to whom. They also hid likes and retweet counts - Twitter's primary incentives - behind a tap to put the primary focus on reply text. Now they were about to see, for the first time, what people thought. Some of that initial feedback said that the bubbly design made Twitter feel more like a chat, and that it was easier to understand who was responding to what.\"</p><p>             -- Meanwhile, China banned Wikipedia in all languages.

Currently, consumers often must elect to use carriers' robocall-blocking tools, some of them costing a monthly fee\u00a0... While the chairman said the agency is going to 'encourage companies to offer this for free,' the FCC's forthcoming directive does not require them to do so. ...

But who cares? You won't be CEO in 10 years when that happens.\"</p><p>             Rubio said Trump's biggest problem right now is that Chinese leaders are unaccustomed to a president going to the mat this way and have therefore miscalculated his resolve. \"They have traditionally been able to unleash the American corporate class to march up to D.C. and pressure their policymakers to back down because so many of these companies have established a market presence in China that in the short-term is very beneficial but in the long-term is probably suicide for those companies,\" Rubio said. \"That's what's happened in the past. This is the first administration that has not backed down.\"</p><p>             The senator's comments on China came as he uncorked a broader, extended critique of American corporate culture. Rubio, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, faulted CEOs for focusing too much on the next quarter and not enough on the next generation. He blamed warped incentives from Wall Street and Washington for driving this shift. And he complained that the \"shareholder primacy theory\" - which is taught at business schools and accepted as gospel in the C-suites of most Fortune 500 corporations - has prompted too many business leaders to care more about returns for shareholders than the people who work for them.</p><p>             Rubio gave me the first look at a 37-page report he plans to release later today on the decline of business investment over the past several decades. It details how nonfinancial corporations, for the first time, now consistently spend more on acquiring financial assets than on capital development. \"At its core, the problem is that, beginning in the 1970s, the primary objective for companies became maximizing return to shareholders, and that came at the expense of investing in new capacities and in innovation,\" Rubio said. \"In essence, it's coming at the expense of the things that lead to growth. In key industries that are critical to our national security and our national interests, that's even more problematic.\"</p><p>             He declined to name names, as has become so fashionable among politicians of both parties during the Trump era, but Rubio's unsparing rebuke of the business community more broadly was no less searing as a result.          </p><p>\"What it's resulted in is that you can become a very profitable company that returns a lot of money to shareholders by taking your productive capacity and sending it to China or by turning over your intellectual property because they're allowing you market access, which is generating new revenue,\" he added. \"That's great for the short- to mid-term. Your stock performance can be very good. Your shareholders are going to be very happy. But it's devastating for American workers, and in the long term it's devastating for America.\"</p><p>             The senator will chair a hearing at 2:30 p.m. Eastern to consider the reauthorization of the Small Business Administration's innovation programs. He'll question two administration officials, and he's invited four outside witnesses to offer ideas for how government policy can spur additional business investment.</p><p>             There is a growing recognition among elites across the ideological spectrum that capitalism itself is in trouble. The 47-year-old son of Cuban immigrants said he wants to save the economic system that made America exceptional by paying more attention to its excesses. \"Our economy today is really not working the way free enterprise works at its best,\" he explained. \"I'm an enormous supporter of free market capitalism because I've seen and know that it's generated more prosperity than any other economic system in human history, but when it stops working the way it's supposed to work, it creates the structural imbalances that lead to many of the problems that we're seeing across not just the U.S. but across multiple developed Western economies. We are certainly doing well in the short- to mid-term in our growth, but we also have an obligation to think about the structural challenges that will make it difficult to sustain that in the long term if we don't make additional changes.\"</p><p>             To do that, he wants more rewards for long-term investments in workers and facilities. \"We can't force companies to be innovative, but we shouldn't have tax provisions or policy provisions that incentivize against it,\" Rubio said.\u00a0\"And we do.\"</p><p>             The senator said he tried to push for things that would advance this aim during the debate over the GOP's 2017 tax bill, but he couldn't get them all. The legislation made full expensing available to capital investment, except facilities, plus research and development expenses. Those provisions are scheduled to expire. Rubio wants to make them permanent, as well as expand the full expensing to cover facilities. He said he wanted to see the full refundability of the child tax credit because it would help workers.</p><p>             \"If we're going to have preferences in our tax code, and the tax code always has preferences, they should be in favor of things that create strong and stable jobs,\" he said. \"Returns to shareholders should be treated equally, no matter which route you choose, whether it's a buyback or a dividend.\"</p><p>             As a political matter, Rubio has concluded that the GOP focused too much in the past on catering to corporate executives at the expense of their consumers and their employees. This year he's rolling out a series of proposals aimed at restoring the balance between businesses and their workers. \"We have a free market, but that free market operates under the conditions created for it by policymakers,\" he said. \"Those conditions should reflect our national priorities. And one of our top national priorities should be creating strong and stable jobs upon which strong families and strong communities can take root.\"</p><p>             Rubio's emerging \"pro-work agenda,\" as he calls it, reflects the GOP's broader embrace of populism during the Trump era. For others following this zeitgeist, read my Big Idea from yesterday about freshman Republican Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri.</p><p>             Rubio's new report and Hawley's maiden speech, which he'll deliver on the Senate floor later today, can be viewed against the backdrop of growing tensions between corporate America and the Republican Party.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the political network led by the billionaire industrialist Charles Koch have both distanced themselves from the GOP in the wake of Trump's takeover, which has made the party less supportive of free trade and expanded immigration.</p><p>             In our interview, Rubio recounted how his unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination against Trump in 2016 opened his eyes to the number of people being left behind by the changing economy, especially in places like the industrial Midwest.          </p><p>\"Heading into 2014, I started to become very interested in not the daily ups and downs or twists and turns of markets but the broader structural challenges,\" he said. \"And then I ran for president and it gave me the chance to travel the country and meet people and interact with people of various backgrounds, which I had not been directly exposed to representing only Florida. ... Someone working in an industrial city that's been hollowed out isn't necessarily going to move to Silicon Valley and work for a high-tech firm. And even if that transition eventually happens, in the interim period, these are real people and real communities that are left behind. So that stark reality, coming back to the Senate, led me to further explore this.\"</p><p>             Rubio added that he also came to understand why government must play a more muscular role in doing something. \"We need to get back to a point where we don't solely analyze the American economy on traditional economic measures,\" he said. \"GDP growth is important, but that alone doesn't tell us the full story. It has to be not just growth that we care about, but the kind of growth that creates stable jobs that allow strong families and strong communities to develop, which are the backbone of a strong economy. Our public policy should reflect that.\"</p><p>             Bigger picture, Rubio lamented that Americans in the modern era have become overly susceptible to the temptations connected to the pursuit of instant gratification. \"We have a challenge that's developed in our culture writ large in that we seek immediate returns, whether it's in our own lives or in corporate life, and we oftentimes do so at the expense of long-term development,\" he said. \"That is best encapsulated by what's happened in the private sector in this country.\"</p><p>             Defending Trump's hard-line approach toward China, Rubio said it's imperative to fight for a better balance in Sino-Americans relations. \"I believe that the imbalance that has developed between our countries on economics and geopolitics is dangerous,\" he said. \"It will leave us with a world in which China grows emboldened and aggressive, and the U.S. will be forced to respond. And it could lead to conflict. It's already leading to trade conflict, and it could lead to worse. For the sake of global stability, there has to be equilibrium in that relationship, and we don't have it right now. At its core, this is very simple: China is allowed to do anything they want in our economy and in Western economies, but our firms are allowed to do very little of anything and pay a tremendous price over there.\"</p><p>             Rubio acknowledges that the trade war with China is harmful to the American economy in the short term and that the tariffs increase costs for U.S. consumers. But he says he believes it's worth it. \"Surrendering to China will be devastating,\" Rubio reasoned. \"It will fundamentally alter our place in the world and the very nature of our economy for two generations or more.\"</p><p>             THE LATEST ON THE CHINA STANDOFF:          </p><p>             -- Trump thinks his China tariffs will help him win reelection.Robert Costa, Josh Dawsey and Sean Sullivan report: \"'I don't see him crying uncle anytime soon,' said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who withdrew from consideration as a Trump Federal Reserve Board nominee amid an uproar. 'It's a high-risk strategy, but it's not in his personality to back down. This goes back to what he said that first time he came down the escalator at Trump Tower.' Speaking to reporters Tuesday before boarding Marine One en route to Louisiana, Trump insisted that he is in a 'very, very strong position' and called the stalled negotiations 'a little squabble.' ... But as Trump expresses confidence, there have been tensions inside the White House, with some advisers uneasy with Trump's strident nationalism and firm belief in tariffs as economic weapons.\"</p><p>             -- Some Republican senators expressed fresh concern over the impact of the trade war on rural America.Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Taylor Telford report: \"'I'm not sure if you talk to him face to face, he hears everything you say,' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) ... Republican lawmakers are also looking for ways to provide a taxpayer bailout to farmers, perhaps adding billions of dollars to a disaster bill that has languished in Congress for weeks. ... Until last week, many Republican senators supported a tougher approach with China. But with Trump's decision to increase tariffs, GOP lawmakers are now fielding angry calls. Soybean farmers, pork producers and a growing number of other agricultural interests across a range of states - including cherry producers, corn growers and lobstermen - have complained that they are collateral damage caught in the middle of the escalating trade battle.\"</p><p>             -- Trump continues to insist China is paying for the tariffs, but it does not feel that way for many Americans.David J. Lynch reports: \"A pair of recent studies, by two teams of economists from institutions such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as Princeton, Yale and Columbia universities, both concluded that Americans are bearing nearly the entire cost of Trump's tariffs. ... If he opts to proceed - and he took the first official step toward doing so on Monday - the economic impact will dwarf his previous levies on foreign washing machines, solar panels, industrial metals and about half of what the United States purchases each year from China. Once in place, the tariffs would cost the typical family of four nearly $2,400 annually, destroy 2.2 million jobs and shave more than $200 billion from the size of the economy, according to a study for an anti-tariff group by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a Washington-based consultancy.\"</p><p>             -- Despite blasting Beijing's trade policies in the recent past, Democrats are not supporting Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports.Politico's Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle report: \"In interviews with a dozen House and Senate Democrats from the Midwest and in leadership, most lawmakers refused to back Trump's offensive against China, particularly as he's kept tariffs on U.S. allies. Even those most willing to praise Trump on trade have been notably reserved. ... Nancy Pelosi told reporters Monday that Trump's action toward Beijing is 'in recognition that something needed to be done.' But she again criticized the president for 'antagonizing' Europe with a separate series of tariffs last year instead of trying to join with European Union allies to pressure China. ... 'I still hope he can reach an agreement, but I don't know. He's pretty unaware of the damage they're doing if they don't get an agreement soon,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has otherwise supported Trump's tough-on-China approach.\"</p><p>             -- Trump continues to push a misleading narrative about his trade war. Fact Checker Glenn Kessler reviewed some of the president's latest tweets: He constantly claims \"that the United States has been ripped off by other countries for years. ... But Trump consistently gets two things wrong here. First, he overstates the trade deficit with China. It was $378 billion in 2018, $336 billion in 2017 and $308 billion in 2016. But for Trump, it's always been $500 billion. Even if one just focuses on trade in goods, the deficit in 2018 was still not $500 billion, but $419 billion. Given the rise in the trade deficit during his presidency, perhaps one day Trump will be right. Second, countries do not 'lose' money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country.\"</p><p>             -- There's a new effort in Congress to prevent Chinese interests from gaining access to sensitive information by hiring former national security officials as lobbyists.From Josh Rogin: \"The case of former Obama administration cybersecurity official Samir Jain has sparked a reaction from lawmakers who see his new gig as a lobbyist for Huawei as problematic.

That includes Georgia, where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a 'heartbeat bill' into law on Tuesday. ... The Alabama bill, which passed 25-6, is even more restrictive than prior state-level abortion laws, and it includes a penalty of up to 99 years in prison for doctors who perform abortions. ...

During his first tour at the Justice Department, Barr issued a controversial secret opinion saying that the president could order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, a ruling that paved the way for the arrest in Panama of then-leader Manuel Antonio Noriega. Two years after that, Barr offered another far-reaching interpretation of presidential power, advising President George H.W. Bush that he did not need congressional approval to invade Iraq. Later, as attorney general, he backed Bush's pardons of six Reagan administration officials charged in the Iran-contra investigation, a move the independent counsel described at the time as 'a coverup.'

Ross responded about three hours later, in an email apparently typed from his iPhone. ... He urged Johnson to schedule a time for them to meet with Macie Leach, a senior adviser to the commerce secretary. ... The puzzling interaction raises questions about why a high-ranking government official would entertain a figure as divisive as Johnson, especially since by late 2018 Johnson's affiliation with white supremacists and other fringe figures was well known.\"</p><p>             -- Department of Labor chief of staff Nick Geale will leave after a White House probe.\u00a0Bloomberg Law's Ben Penn, Jaclyn Diaz and Chris Opfer report: \"Geale is leaving the department at the end of the month, an agency official confirmed.

Using a derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the president mused: 'Pocahontas, I think, is probably out.' Trump also said former vice president Joe Biden 'doesn't look like the guy I knew' while taking aim at 'crazy' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has a 'lot more energy than Biden . . . but it's energy to get rid of your jobs.' And Trump ridiculed former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) for a Vanity Fair interview in which O'Rourke claimed that he was 'just born to be in' the presidential race.

'Nafta still resonates in the industrial Midwest and Rust Belt,' says Stanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster who recently conducted focus groups on trade in Michigan and Wisconsin.

Only four candidates - Harris, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg - have drawn more viewers than CNN averages on a typical weeknight, around 1.16 million people. The rest, at least in television terms, have ranged anywhere from subpar to flaming disasters.

'You're right,' O'Rourke responded. 'There are things that I have been privileged to do in my life that others cannot.

Bullock has been unequivocal in shrugging off the Senate recruitment, which has included conversations with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democratic senators.

Many of the newcomers can claim Spanish citizenship based on their ancestry.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) cold-called Arod Taylor, a retired dentist living in California. Of the 60 people he interviewed for his new book, a list that includes many Democratic luminaries, the senior senator from Ohio said his hour-long chat with Taylor may have been the most fun.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor's father was a colorful, and liberal, one-term senator from Idaho who, from 1945 to 1951, sat at the same desk in the Senate chamber that now belongs to Brown, who won his third term last year. Glen Taylor was a singing cowboy who struggled financially. To make ends meet, he worked as a country musician in a western band, a construction worker, a sheet metal worker in a munitions plant, a toupee maker and a carpenter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He lost gadfly bids for Congress in 1938, 1940, 1942, 1954 and 1956. But he won in 1944, and that earned him a place in history. He crusaded for civil rights, despite representing fewer than a thousand African American constituents, and championed collective bargaining rights, even though there's never been a strong organized labor presence in Idaho.</p><p>In 1948, as the vice-presidential nominee for the Progressive Party, Glen Taylor and his family visited Birmingham, Ala., where he was arrested by Bull Connor's deputies for attempting to enter a church through a door marked \"Coloreds Only.\" As a sitting senator, Taylor was booked into the same Birmingham jail from which Martin Luther King Jr. would write his famous letter 15 years later.</p><p>\"His son at first wondered, 'Why are you digging up things about my dad?' Because he was a pretty controversial guy,\" Brown said in an interview. \"He was always accused of being a communist and red-baited and all that. So his son was probably a little reluctant at first, but he told me the story about what happened at the Birmingham jail.\"</p><p>             -- Glen Taylor is one of the eight progressive\u00a0Democratic senators profiled by Brown in \"Desk 88,\" a book he's been working on as a side project for 11 years. All of them sat at the same mahogany desk over the course of the 20th century. Some are well known, from Robert F. Kennedy and George McGovern to Al Gore Sr. and Hugo Black. Others have faded from memory, such as William Proxmire, or have become footnotes, like Theodore Francis Green and Herbert Lehman, outside of the states they once represented. All eight have interesting stories, and Brown brings them all to life.</p><p>After Brown defeated a GOP incumbent in 2006, the senator's wife, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Connie Schultz, ordered 10 books online as a gift so that he could learn more about the history of the chamber he was joining. Brown decided to write his own book in 2008. He has pursued the research as a hobby whenever he could squeeze in the time.</p><p>\"I read literally 160 books. I read, entirely, probably 140 or 150 of them and then parts of another 20,\" he told me between votes last week. \"I write mostly in longhand. I started writing 11 years ago. I would sometimes be sitting somewhere in an airport or something. I don't carry a laptop with me, so it wasn't a rush project.\"</p><p>             -- Some of the former senators were much easier to research than others. \"I started asking people if they knew who Glen Taylor was,\" Brown remembered. \"I think four people did out of 110 or something who I asked. I just kind of quit asking. It was fun to research him, but there was only one book he wrote and one biography of him. I don't have a whole research team. I've got nobody. I don't spend a lot of time online doing research, but I found out enough about him. And then I reached his son, which was just fortuitous.\"</p><p>             Arod Taylor helped put meat on the bones of a 24-page chapter. The son recalled traveling around Idaho in a beat-up Ford as a young boy. He'd sing songs to warm up the crowd, and as his dad spoke, his mom would walk around with a collection plate to take donations to keep them on the road.</p><p>The elder Taylor's political conversion came in 1932 when he stumbled upon the autobiography of King Camp Gillette, the multimillionaire inventor of the razor by the same name who considered himself a \"utopian socialist.\" Reading \"The People's Corporation\" prompted Taylor, who never had more than six years of formal schooling, to study economics during the depths of the Depression. Then one crisp fall day in 1936, Taylor accidentally wandered into a political rally in a small theater\u00a0where the governor was campaigning for Senate. He realized politics was like acting, and he was hooked.</p><p>             After the 1946 midterms, Taylor stood up on the Senate floor to object to the seating of fellow Democrat Theodore Bilbo, a rancid racist who had encouraged violence against blacks in his home state of Mississippi as he sought reelection and took gifts from defense contractors during World War II. Citing contemporaneous news accounts that said Taylor could be played by Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper, Brown paints a vivid picture:</p><p>\"Holding the floor for an hour - amid catcalls and interruptions from southern Democrats and some of their conservative Republican allies - the third-year senator laid out his case: 'We are not only on trial collectively, we are on trial individually,'\" he writes. \"Minority Leader Alben Barkley resolved the stalemate by asking that Bilbo's credentials be tabled without action while he underwent [cancer] surgery. Bilbo was never sworn in for a third term. He died in a New Orleans hospital eight months later at the age of sixty-nine.\"</p><p>             Taylor agreed to be Henry Wallace's running mate in 1948 when he challenged Harry Truman from the left. Wallace had been FDR's vice president but was dropped for Truman in 1944. A few months after he got arrested, segregationist Southerners who walked out of the Democratic National Convention met in Birmingham to nominate Strom Thurmond as the standard-bearer of the Dixiecrats. Brown credits the Wallace-Taylor challenge with pushing Truman to embrace a host of liberal ideas and paving the way for then-Minneapolis Mayor and future senator Hubert Humphrey to insert a strong voting rights plank into the official Democratic platform that year.</p><p>             After being labeled a communist, including by a hostile local press, Taylor lost the Democratic primary by fewer than a thousand votes when he ran for reelection in 1950. A Republican subsequently won the general. The book is not just hagiography. Brown faults Taylor for marginalizing himself with a quixotic national campaign and giving too much fodder to his detractors. But he praises the one-term wonder for being \"way ahead of his time.\"</p><p>\"At one time, I stated on the floor of the Senate that I was going to vote my convictions, as though I never expected to come back,\" Taylor said in his farewell address, delivered from behind the desk where Brown now sits. \"All I can say is that I did vote my convictions, and I did not come back.\"</p><p>             -- Brown, who turned 67 on Saturday, insists he has no regrets about not running for president, and he's staying neutral for now in the 2020 nominating contest. \"I just didn't have the desire to do it,\" he said. \"You have to really, really want that job. Nobody has ever heard me say I want to be president of the United States. I never thought I did. I thought really seriously about it in January and February, and I thought there was a path, but I don't look back. And I'm going to have influence in this presidential by din of where I'm from and what my message is. I think we win this race if Democrats talk about the dignity of work.\"</p><p>             He suggested that his Republican colleagues can learn something from the political courage displayed by several of the former senators he's written about, especially with a potential impeachment trial looming. In some cases, the men Brown profiles sought to atone after blunders early in their careers. Black, for example, was a KKK member who wound up ensuring that Brown v. Board was unanimously decided by the Supreme Court. Kennedy was a staffer for red-baiting Joe McCarthy but evolved in later years.</p><p>\"We've all had those moments when we've failed, I'm sure, but a whole political party has failed now in not doing what they should do,\" Brown said in an interview. \"I hear so many Republicans talking about how [President] Trump's a liar, Trump's a racist and 'We know something's going on with the Russians,' but they won't say it publicly.\"</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) will retire after 14 terms.\u00a0The former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee announced on Facebook this morning that he won't seek reelection so he can spend more time with his wife and children. The 75-year-old said he will support Trump's reelection and wasn't worried about losing his own\u00a0reelection, emphasizing that he has more than $1 million in his campaign account. But his retirement is a reflection of the conventional wisdom among House Republicans that they're unlikely to win back the majority next November. (John Wagner)</p><p>             THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GOES PUBLIC THIS WEEK:          </p><p>             -- The key impeachment question is: What did Trump want from Ukraine - and what exactly did he do?Greg Jaffe sets the table for this week's televised hearings: \"In the nearly 3,000 pages of interviews from the House impeachment inquiry released last week, President Trump often seems like a supporting character in someone else's drama. Aides struggle to please him. They fret about his fits of rage and do their best to anticipate his ever-shifting impulses and desires. Trump is an unseen and mercurial presence. 'President Trump changes his mind on what he wants on a daily basis,' said Gordon Sondland, the Trump megadonor-turned-diplomat who sought to help Ukraine's new leader - desperate for American aid and an Oval Office meeting with Trump - understand what the president actually wanted from him. ...</p><p>\"To answer that question, Republicans and Democrats have cited the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky - a conversation that witnesses have described as 'improper,' 'shocking' and a confusing mishmash of conspiracy theories, empty threats and non sequiturs. Republicans have made the rough transcript and the chaotic nature of the Trump presidency a central part of their defense. ... Democrats are counting on using the testimony of those around Trump - a mix of aides, sycophants and serious-minded civil servants - to make clear exactly what Trump was demanding of the Ukrainian president on the July 25 call.</p><p>\"Senior U.S. officials working on Ukraine often seemed to live in a state of dread and confusion over what the president might do or tweet. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was clinging to her job in Kyiv this spring, amid a smear campaign organized by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, when State Department officials told her to leave her possessions behind and come home on the first possible plane. Her bosses in Washington didn't fear for her safety; rather, they feared Trump. ...</p><p>\"Most officials suspected Trump's rage traced back to the conspiracy-theory conversations he was having with Giuliani regarding alleged - and unsubstantiated - Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. ... Giuliani often called Trump on his personal cellphone, so there was no record of when he called or what he talked about with the president ... Even the highest-ranking officials were flying blind. Whenever Giuliani popped up on the television in John Bolton's West Wing office, the national security adviser would turn up the volume to try to learn what he might be telling Trump, said Fiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Ukraine policy in the White House. Meanwhile, Bolton issued orders to his aides to steer clear of Giuliani and his schemes. ...</p><p>\"Less clear is whether Trump ordered a hold on the $391 million in military aid to shake down the Ukrainians. Senior U.S. officials first learned of the freeze during a July 18 video conference in which an off-camera staff person from the White House's Office of Management and Budget said there was a hold on the aid, but would not say why. 'I and others sat in astonishment,' recalled acting ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., who had dialed in from Ukraine. ... Top officials at the Pentagon and State Department spent much of July and August struggling to figure out why Trump had frozen the aid and how to get it flowing. The answers were vague and unsatisfying. ...</p><p>\"That leaves Sondland as the witness who had the most frequent and direct conversations with Trump about Ukraine. Sondland, though, has proved to be an unreliable narrator, subject to massive memory gaps, frequent misstatements and a tendency toward self-aggrandizement. He boasted to White House officials of frequent meetings with Trump but seems to have been exaggerating. ... In his sworn testimony, Sondland struggled to recall his meetings with the president and other top U.S. officials, prompting flustered Democrats to wonder whether he was drunk or on some kind of medication that causes memory lapses. ... Taylor replied that Sondland seemed sober. ...</p><p>\"In September, Sondland told top Ukrainian officials that their military aid wouldn't flow until Zelensky announced on television that he would investigate the Ukrainian gas company that employed Biden's son. The Ukrainians pondered putting Zelensky on CNN. Sondland, eager to please Trump, suggested Tucker Carlson's Fox News program. Meanwhile, senior U.S. officials in Kyiv and Washington worried the entire scheme was illegal. ... Notably, Sondland, the witness from the closed-door round of questioning who spoke most directly with Trump about Ukraine, isn't on either party's witness list.\"</p><p>             -- Here's what's on deck for this week:          </p><p>             -- One of Giuliani's indicted associates says he was told by the president's lawyer as far back as the spring to give the Ukrainians an ultimatum on aid,the New York Times reports: \"The associate, Lev Parnas, told a representative of the incoming government [during a trip to Kyiv] that it had to announce an investigation into [Joe Biden] and his son, or else Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president, and the United States would freeze aid, the lawyer said. ... Mr. Pence did not attend the inauguration. ...\u00a0The dispute represents the clearest indication yet that Mr. Parnas, who was indicted along with [Igor] Fruman last month on campaign finance charges, has turned on Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. ... Mr. Parnas's account of the meeting, if corroborated, would reveal the earliest known instance of American aid being tied to demands for Ukraine to take actions that could benefit Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. It would also represent a more extensive threat - to pull Mr. Pence from the inaugural delegation - than was previously known. ...</p><p>\"But Mr. Parnas's account, while potentially significant, is being contradicted on several fronts. None of the people involved dispute that the meeting occurred, but Mr. Parnas stands alone in saying the intention was to present an ultimatum to the Ukrainian leadership. Another participant in the meeting, Mr. Parnas's business partner, [Fruman], said Mr. Parnas's claim was false; the men never raised the issues of aid or the vice president's attendance at the inauguration, lawyers for Mr. Fruman said. Mr. Giuliani denied Mr. Parnas's contention that he had delivered the warning at the direction of Mr. Giuliani.\"</p><p>             -- White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that would determine whether senior administration officials can testify in the impeachment inquiry rattled allies of the former national security adviser.\u00a0Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: \"The suit was filed by Bolton's former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House ... People close to Bolton and Kupperman said the two were flabbergasted by Mulvaney's surprise request to join the lawsuit because they and others on the national security team considered Mulvaney a critical player in the effort to get the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into Trump's political opponents. Their objection is twofold: Bolton views Mulvaney as a key participant in the pressure campaign, a situation that the then-national security adviser referred to derisively as 'a drug deal,' according to congressional testimony by his aides ... And they believe Mulvaney's goal is to avoid testifying by joining a suit involving officials whose attorney has argued they may be limited in what they can share with Congress because of their role advising the president on national security matters.\"</p><p>             -- Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley claims in a new memoir that former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly tried to recruit her to \"save the country\" by undermining Trump. She says she refused.Anne Gearan reports: \"'Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country,' Haley wrote. 'It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn't know what he was doing,' Haley wrote of the views the two men held. Tillerson also told her that people would die if Trump was unchecked, Haley wrote. Tillerson did not respond to a request for comment. Kelly declined to comment in detail, but said that if providing the president 'with the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision is 'working against Trump,' then guilty as charged.' ...\u00a0</p><p>\"The former South Carolina governor, widely viewed by Republicans as a top potential presidential candidate in 2024, has repeatedly sought to minimize differences with Trump while distancing herself from his excesses. Tillerson and others had an obligation to carry out the president's agenda because he had been elected, not them, Haley wrote. If they disagreed strongly enough, she said they should quit. ... Haley said Kelly stalled and put her off when she wanted to get in to see Trump. When she went around him, he complained. Kelly also made it clear that he thought Trump's decision to make Haley a full member of the Cabinet, and have her attend National Security Council meetings, had been 'terrible,' and that he would ensure the next U.N. ambassador did not carry that rank, she wrote. ... Haley's successor, Kelly Knight Craft, who assumed the U.N. job in September, does not carry the same rank Haley did.\"</p><p>             As part of her promotional tour for the book, Haley said she opposes Trump's efforts to seek foreign help for political investigations but said his actions vis-a-vis Ukraine are not impeachable: \"It's hard for me to understand where the whole impeachment situation is coming from, because what everybody's up in arms about didn't happen,\"\u00a0Haley said. \"Do I think the president did something that warrants impeachment? No, because the aid flowed.\"</p><p>             -- Democrats spent Sunday dismissing GOP efforts to call the anonymous first\u00a0whistleblower and Hunter Biden to testify as part of the inquiry.Felicia Sonmez, Joel Achenbach and Paige Winfield Cunningham report: \"Republicans do not want to focus on the much-discussed July 25 phone call ... or even on events of recent months. Instead, they are seeking to broaden the investigation to include actions taken years ago by the Bidens. On NBC News's 'Meet the Press,' Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) argued that 'it's unfair to treat Trump under one standard and Joe Biden under a different standard.' He claimed that a variety of American elected officials from both parties have in recent years sought to use leverage over Ukraine to advance some kind of agenda. ... House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that Democrats would evaluate the requests but that the impeachment probe 'will not serve . . . as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations' into the Bidens or the 2016 campaign, or to retaliate against the whistleblower.\"</p><p>             -- Speaking on Fox News, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the Democratic inquiry a \"calculated coup\" that's being \"orchestrated\" by Schiff. \"We are watching him orchestrate a takedown of a president, after we just celebrated 30 years of taking down the Berlin Wall,\" McCarthy said. McCarthy also announced that Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) is taking a \"leave of absence\" from the House Intelligence Committee so that McCarthy\u00a0can give a spot to the pro-Trump firebrand Jim Jordan.          </p><p>             -- There is growing buzz on Capitol Hill that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is angling to replace Mulvaney, per\u00a0the Washington Examiner: \"The conservative Republican congressman in recent days accompanied Trump to New York to attend a mixed martial arts fight and then joined the president a couple of days later for a campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky - trips and locales with no connection to the Republican congressman's western North Carolina House district. ... Trump recently declined in a Washington Examiner interview to say he was happy with Mulvaney's performance. This, as well as the trips and Meadows's frequent presence in the White House, is leading some Republican aides and lawmakers in the House to believe the congressman is auditioning to become chief of staff.\"</p><p>             -- Fox News contributor Mollie\u00a0Hemingway\u00a0caused a scene after she named an alleged whistleblower on the air, seemingly breaking the network's             policy of identifying the person.From the Daily Beast: \"Right-wing media outlets have touted an online report purportedly sharing the identity of the person. Mainstream media outlets and social media platforms, meanwhile, have refrained from spreading the person's name. Fox News had reportedly also instructed its employees to not name the alleged whistleblower. ... During Sunday's broadcast of Fox News media analysis show MediaBuzz, Hemingway-who is also the senior editor of right-wing website The Federalist-took part in a panel discussion on whether or not the press should reveal the alleged whistleblower's name and identity. After noting that the New York Times had provided a lot of identifying details on its report about the whistleblower, Hemingway went on to point to the online article naming the person while explaining that the whistleblower's name's 'already out there.' ... Host Howard Kurtz, clearly startled, immediately shot back that he didn't know if that person was actually the whistleblower.\"</p><p>             -- We are going to focus on substance, not stunts, this week. For reporters covering Trump, the impeachment hearings will present the trickiest test yet, warns\u00a0Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan: \"Journalists have done a lot right - they have pointed out lies, dug out what's really happening, skillfully explained and analyzed. But on Wednesday - as televised impeachment hearings begin in the House of Representatives - journalists need to be on their game. The stakes don't get much higher when it comes to fulfilling their core mission: informing citizens of what they really need to know. ... Journalists and pundits love to ponder about how the public is reacting to news, though they aren't much good at it. ... Avoiding that would be a public service. ... Don't let stunts hijack the coverage. If we know anything about Trump's reaction when things get tough, it's that he and his allies will haul out some attention-grabbing performance art and its distractions. Trump will act out - because that's what he does. ... Beware mealy-mouthed and misleading language.\"</p><p>             THE NEW WORLD ORDER:          </p><p>             -- Bolivian President\u00a0Evo Morales resigned amid an increasingly violent uprising that he labeled a \"coup\" after the country's military pulled its support.Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: \"Morales's stunning fall after nearly 14 years in office came hours after the Organization of American States said it had found 'clear manipulation' of the vote last month in which the elder statesman of the Latin American left claimed victory. The dizzying pace of developments Sunday made an ignominious ending for the region's longest-serving leader. Bolivia's first indigenous president won credit for fighting poverty and transforming cities with state investment even as criticism of his authoritarian tendencies rose. Ultimately, the 60-year-old socialist who once commanded landslide victories at the polls found himself isolated: The heads of the armed forces and national police both called on Morales to step down on Sunday, and the country's main labor union asked him to resign if that's what it took to save a nation rapidly plunging into mob rule. ... Late Sunday, Morales tweeted that a police official had publicly called for his detention. 'The coup mongers are destroying the rule of law,' Morales wrote. ...</p><p>                 \"Gen. Vladimir Calder\u00f3n, the head of Bolivia's national police, denied in an interview with the local media that arrest warrants had been issued for Morales or his ministers, adding that forces had been deployed to try to restore order amid widespread reports of looting and violence.\u00a0...\u00a0Morales's resignation did not stop the violence - socialist officials denounced the ransacking of Morales's home late Sunday. The former head of Bolivia's electoral tribunal, Maria Eugenia Choque, was detained, police said. ... Also stepping down were Vice President \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, Chamber of Deputies President Victor Borda and Senate President Adriana Salvatierra, leaving the country without a constitutional leader. Borda resigned after protesters set his house in the mountain city of Potosi ablaze and kidnapped his brother. It was unclear who will take charge. Under the Bolivian constitution, elections after such a crisis must be held within 90 days.\"</p><p>             -- The shooting of a pro-democracy protester by Hong Kong police unleashed a chaotic chain of events on Monday, as thousands of demonstrators clashed with riot police in the city's financial district and violent confrontations erupted at university campuses, plunging the Asian financial hub further into turmoil.Anna Kam, Casey Quackenbush and Ryan Ho Kilpatrick report: \"Tensions soared across the city. In the afternoon, police fired tear gas as a melee of protesters and office workers packed streets and flyovers in the downtown area. 'Disband the police!' they shouted. Protesters threw debris into the road, brought traffic to a halt, and set fires. Later, a man was doused with liquid and set alight.</p><p>\"There had been calls for a general strike on Monday, the latest step in months of anti-government unrest that has convulsed the former British colony and posed a direct challenge to Chinese rule. But the immediate spark for the escalation came when a police officer fired live rounds in the Sai Wan Ho neighborhood early in the day, critically injuring a 21-year-old protester who appeared to be unarmed. Police confirmed that one man had been shot by an officer. ... Yet far from blunting the democracy movement, the intensifying crackdown has prompted protesters to adopt more aggressive tactics. With the deeply divided city descending into disorder, there has been no sign that Beijing might change tack or allow the Hong Kong government to offer a political compromise.\"</p><p>             -- Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced that the U.S. will leave up to 600 troops in northeastern Syria to prevent an Islamic State resurgence.Karen DeYoung reports: \"Milley, speaking on the ABC News program 'This Week,' said the number of troops that would remain was 'probably in the 500-ish frame. Maybe 600.' He did not mention Syrian oil but said 'there are still ISIS fighters in the region and unless pressure is maintained ... then there's a very real possibility that conditions could be set for a reemergence of ISIS.' ... A separate U.S. force of about 150 remains in southern Syria, on the Jordanian border.\"</p><p>             -- Iran said an open case involving an ex-FBI agent who disappeared in 2007 on an unauthorized CIA mission was a \"missing person\" filing, not a sign that the man is being prosecuted.From the AP: \"Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi's comments come as a new Iranian acknowledgement of the case involving Robert Levinson renewed questions about his disappearance. The U.S. is offering $25 million for information about what happened to Levinson, who disappeared from Iran's Kish Island on March 9, 2007. [Trump] meanwhile called for Iran to turn over Levinson, whom he described as 'kidnapped.' ... Iran's Revolutionary Court typically handles espionage cases and others involving smuggling, blasphemy and attempts to overthrow its Islamic government. Westerners and Iranian dual nationals with ties to the West often find themselves tried and convicted in closed-door trials in these courts, only later to be used as bargaining chips in negotiations. For years, U.S. officials would only say that Levinson, a meticulous FBI investigator credited with busting Russian and Italian mobsters, was working for a private firm on his trip.\"</p><p>             -- A general was the leading suspect in the biggest anti-corruption case in Mexico, where he stood accused of abetting billions of dollars in oil theft. He's nowhere to be seen.Kevin Sieff reports: \"Judge Ang\u00e9lica Lucio Rosales looked out at the crowd of lawyers and family members in the federal courtroom, unimpressed. 'Where is General Trauwitz?' she asked. When Eduardo Le\u00f3n Trauwitz, 53, missed the previous hearing, his lawyers said he was in the hospital. This time, they said, he was out of the country. In a case that has come to be seen as a test of Mexico's ability to crack down on corruption, it was a remarkable illustration of the challenges ahead: Even getting the accused to appear in court is not easy.\"</p><p>             -- A World War II submarine was missing for 75 years until last June, when high-tech undersea drones solved the mystery.Tim Elfrink reports: \"Tim Taylor was about to end the mission. His team had scoured the seabed off Japan with autonomous underwater vehicles, which are essentially high-tech drones, without a hit. His ship now needed repairs, and a $7 million drone had just reported an error on its latest dive. All that remained was to download the data from that drone before heading hundreds of miles back to shore. That's when they spotted it: An anomalous reading on the ocean floor, more than 1,400 feet deep. The next day, another submersible with high-definition cameras went to investigate. The images it beamed back left no doubt about what Taylor's team had found: A hulking ship lay rusting in the pitch-black water. As the camera rounded the bow and panned to the bridge, an eerily preserved plaque came into view: USS Grayback.\"</p><p>             2020 WATCH:          </p><p>             -- Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0is relishing his role as a political combatant heading into 2020.From the Journal: \"And while he says he is focused solely on the president's re-election, his efforts have fueled speculation among supporters about his own political ambitions.\u00a0... Mr. Trump Jr. demurs when asked about his political future, saying his sights are set on 2020. He did more than 70 events around the country ahead of the 2018 midterms and will do far more this time. While he is a valuable stand-in with conservative voters, his appeal may be more limited in the suburban areas where the president is struggling. Still, he said he's willing to campaign anywhere.\"</p><p>             -- Trump keeps promoting books by members of his inner circle, creating some sort of presidential book club. One question, though, is: Does he really read any of the titles he has spoken so highly of?From the Times: \"He has been upfront about the lack of time and attention he can give to reading, and he has gone back and forth between publicly declaring his love of reading but also telling the world he does not read much. 'Every time I do about a half a page,' Mr. Trump said last year about trying to read a book about Andrew Jackson, 'I get a phone call that there's some emergency, this or that.' People who have observed him over the years are skeptical of his interests in the literary realm. 'He doesn't read at all. I'm not overstating things here,' said Timothy L. O'Brien, who wrote 'TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.' 'He lacks the patience, curiosity and self-awareness to be a good reader, and that's why aides and advisers know the best way to communicate complex thoughts to him is with pictures and charts, or simply verbally.'\"</p><p>             -- A public library in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, says someone keeps hiding books that explore politics through a progressive lens or criticize Trump.From the Times: \"They wind up misfiled in out-of-the-way corners where readers will be sure not to find them. 'I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds,' the mystery book relocator wrote in a note left for [Bette] Ammon, the library director, in the facility's comment box. 'Your liberal angst gives me great pleasure.' ... The incidents over this past year - including a missing book that was discovered only this week - were not the first time books have mysteriously disappeared. Thirty years ago, the library lost so many books on human rights to theft that they had to be placed in a locked cabinet. The latest works to be targeted cover a wide range of topics, from gun control and women's suffrage to LGBTQ issues and how people of color fare in the criminal justice system. About half the books specifically deal with [Trump].\"</p><p>             -- Trump's trade wars are hurting farmers, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is trying to keep them happy as many wonder whether the president will roll out a third bailout in 2020.\u00a0Annie Gowen and William Wan report:\u00a0\"Over the last year, Perdue has emerged as President Trump's key evangelist in bruising trade wars, traveling the country to give folksy pep talks to frustrated farmers who have seen their incomes drop and exports hit hard by tariff disputes. ... Two economists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture ... said a third round of payments for farmers increasingly is seen as inevitable, particularly if a trade deal with China is not reached soon. The amount has not been determined. Perdue said Thursday he was 'hopeful' that the pending trade deal would 'supplant any type of farm aid needed in 2020.' But a third round of aid could be crucial to shoring up Trump's support in rural America as the election looms, analysts say. ... Internally, [Perdue has] been praised for his relentless promotion of the administration's agenda. ... But patience is waning for Perdue's sunny bromides in rural America, where farm bankruptcies and loan delinquencies are rising.\"</p><p>             -- Top Democrats urged Facebook to ban political ads on its platform, but upstart, anti-Trump candidates are objecting, arguing that Facebook creates a more level playing field for challengers than TV does.Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: A review of campaign ads from federal, statewide and state legislative races during the 2018 midterm election found that \"voters are more likely to see Facebook ads than television ads from challengers. ... [The report] also discovered that Facebook advertising was less negative than messaging on television. ... Even as they criticize Facebook, national Democrats rely on the platform to build email lists, solicit small-dollar donations and compete with the conservative media juggernaut that has managed to catapult Trump-friendly stories into a dominant position in Facebook's News Feed. ... While local Democrats say they understand the case for change, they also lack the resources to navigate a web of new regulations.\"</p><p>             -- The Kentucky governor's\u00a0race has become a case study in the real-world impact of disinformation spread through social media, a preview of what election-security officials fear could unfold if the 2020 presidential election comes down to the wire.From the Times: \"A few hours after polls closed in Kentucky last Tuesday, a Twitter user writing under the handle @Overlordkraken1 posted a message to his 19 followers saying he had 'just shredded a box of Republican mail-in ballots.' It was clear that the Kentucky governor's race was going to be excruciatingly close, and that the Republican incumbent, Matt Bevin, could be headed to defeat. ... For those eager to cry fraud as a reliably red state leaned blue, the fact that @Overlordkraken1 did not appear to be in Kentucky - Louisville was misspelled in the location tag on his tweet, for one thing - was not going to get in the way of a useful narrative. Nor was Twitter's decision to suspend his account. ... The talk has only intensified in the days since, though it has yet to be matched by any evidence of actual election rigging. ... Such divisive rhetoric after close elections has always risked shaking public faith in essential democratic institutions. But in a profoundly polarized country where narrow margins are hardly uncommon, sophisticated networks of social media users - human and bot - can quickly turn partisan rancor into grave threats, rapidly amplifying disinformation and creating an initial veneer of vast discord that can eventually become self-fulfilling.\"</p><p>             -- Despite winning the endorsement of prominent African American clergy members in Massachusetts during past races, Elizabeth Warren is still struggling to win over the support of black voters for her presidential campaign.From the Journal: \"As her relationships with Boston's black clergy show, Ms. Warren's faith-which she doesn't often delve into publicly, beyond occasional mentions of teaching Sunday school-is one way she has been able to connect with black voters in Massachusetts. She has tried to replicate that connection ahead of 2020. ... Rev. Miniard Culpepper of Pleasant Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Boston said Ms. Warren would come to church carrying her own Bible. 'It makes a statement,' Rev. Culpepper said. 'Doctors carry their stethoscope. Politicians carrying a Bible says a lot about what they believe and their values and their morals.'\"</p><p>             -- Amazon spent $1.5 million on Seattle City Council races. Kshama Sawant, a socialist opposed by the company, won the race.Hannah Knowles reports: Sawant \"has backed a tax on large companies and pushed successfully to make Seattle the first major city with a $15-per-hour minimum wage. But Sawant's campaign for reelection this year pitted her against Amazon, Seattle's largest private employer, more conspicuously than ever. ... Sawant's faceoff with big tech was on full display over the weekend as she declared victory, from a podium in front of a bright orange banner with the words 'TAX Amazon' in giant print. ... Some say Amazon's money backfired in the council race as people leery of corporate money supported Sawant's cause and as her campaign drew national attention from the likes of Sens. [Warren]\u00a0and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) ... Sawant, too, frames her close race - she pulled ahead late last week - as sending a message with national resonance, about a 'bold, left-leaning and in fact socialist'\u00a0campaign's ability to prevail against business interests.'\" (Amazon\u00a0founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>             SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:          </p><p>Trump got a positive reaction from the crowd on Saturday at the Alabama-LSU game in Tuscaloosa:</p><p>The Louisiana governor congratulated his state's winning team, a week ahead of the runoff that will decide whether he gets a second term:</p><p>Trump celebrated the Marines:\u00a0</p><p>He also promoted Nikki Haley's new book:\u00a0</p><p>A\u00a0senator from Tennessee issued a religious warning:\u00a0</p><p>          On the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, many on Twitter resurfaced this 2015 tweet by\u00a0a current Trump administration official:       </p><p>The man who sparked a Biden gaffe back in the 1980s\u00a0met Biden again, and now he's on the former vice president's team:</p><p>The Newseum closes at the end of the year.

Steve Bullock won't be on the Democratic debate stage next week, but that won't stop him from talking about money in politics.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Campaign finance animates his presidential campaign more than any other issue. In an extended interview, Bullock excitedly recounted the litigation he's been involved with since the Citizens United decision, outlined steps he would take on his first day as president to limit the influence of deep-pocketed donors and discussed strategies to force more disclosure from independent groups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be sure, Bullock is far from the only Democratic candidate talking about this. Most do. Criticizing the Supreme Court's 2010 decision is an easy applause line when speaking to liberal activists on the stump. Several candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke, have released specific plans on restricting dark money. But no one else has made it the centerpiece of their bid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Campaign finance is Bullock's calling card in the same way that climate change propels Jay Inslee, another accomplished second-term Western governor struggling to break through in the crowded field of 23 candidates.</p><p>             Bullock acknowledges that it's challenging to connect what can seem like an esoteric topic for many people to the pocketbook issues that they know impact their daily lives.             In his stump speech, he bends over backward to couple them.          </p><p>\"Look, people don't wake up each day saying, 'Oh, this outside spending is causing me problems,'\" he explained. \"What they say is, 'I'm working harder and I'm making less. My union membership is half of what it was in the 1980s. This economy doesn't seem to be working for me, and the political system doesn't seem to give a damn.' That's where the impact is real. That's where, once you get outside of the 202, people are saying that if elected officials are going to be sort of like NASCAR, where they're sponsored by all kinds of folks, as least we ought to know who is doing the buying.\"</p><p>                             -- The 53-year-old is the only Democratic presidential candidate who has won statewide in a place carried by Donald Trump. He was reelected by four points in 2016 on the same day Trump won Montana by 20 points. Bullock insists he would have qualified if he got in the race earlier - he reportedly fell short by just one respondent in one poll - but he wanted to focus on expanding Medicaid in the state legislative session.</p><p>\"I don't regret waiting until we got health care for 100,000 Montanans,\" he said. \"Four years ago, Ben Carson was polling number one. There's plenty of time. Voters want to make the right decision, not a bad decision.\"</p><p>             -- Bullock plans to bracket next week's debates with televised town halls in the first two early states. On Wednesday evening, WHO-TV's Channel 13 in Des Moines will air an event with the governor moderated by Dave Price, who plans to pose questions submitted online by likely caucus-goers. On Thursday evening, WMUR's Channel 9 in Manchester, N.H., will air its own town hall moderated by Adam Sexton. These events may get Bullock more attention than he would from standing on the main stage with nine other          s.       </p><p>             -- The governor is suing the Trump administration in a bid to compel the Internal Revenue Service to resume collecting information about major donors to groups registered as 501(c)(4) nonprofits. Bullock notes that the IRS announced that it would stop demanding such information by happenstance on the same day Trump held his news conference in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin. Montana's Republican attorney general refused to join the suit, so the governor went to court on his own. A federal judge heard arguments earlier this month about whether the case can proceed. The Trump Justice Department argues that Bullock lacks standing and that states have no right to dictate to the IRS what information it must collect from taxpayers.</p><p>             Bullock argued that the new policy would make it easier for foreigners to funnel money into American elections undetected, and he said the administration did not jump through the necessary procedural hoops to roll back the 40-year-old requirement. \"Right now, you could literally have a foreign company giving to a nonprofit, and no one would even know,\" he said. \"That rule has been around since 1971, and Richard Nixon wasn't the exact model of transparency. ... We really don't know, nor does the IRS know, who was trying to buy our 2018 midterms.\"</p><p>             He expressed confidence that he'll prevail on the merits.             \"I'll be a more geeky lawyer here than you want, but they didn't even do this with notice and comment,\" Bullock said. \"You can't get rid of a regulation by using a sub-regulatory procedure! One of the things that will help when we win this is that they put that rule in effect right away.\"</p><p>             -- This is the latest salvo in a decade-long legal crusade against Citizens United, which he sees as the worst judicial ruling of modern times. Before the 5-to-4 decision was handed down in June 2010, when he was the state's attorney general, he organized a coalition of lawyers to warn of a parade of terribles that could result if the post-Watergate campaign finance regime was scuttled.</p><p>\"Afterward, every other state said, 'Game over. There's nothing we can do,'\" Bullock said. \"In Washington, D.C., at the time, we controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency. People decried the decision. They gave speeches about it. But they didn't do anything.\"</p><p>             Bullock sought to continue enforcing Montana's 1912 ban on corporate spending in elections. The Montana Supreme Court upheld the state's Corrupt Practices Act. But the Supreme Court ruled against Bullock on appeal and struck down the law on a 5-to-4 vote in 2012.</p><p>             In 2015, during his first term as governor, Bullock successfully lobbied the GOP-controlled state legislature to pass a law requiring groups that spend money within 90 days of state elections to disclose where they get their funding. Bullock noted that this prompted several national groups, including the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, to stop running attack ads against him 91 days out from the election when he sought a second term in 2016. In its current term, the Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge to the law - allowing it to stand. \"If you can do that in a state like ours, you ought to be able to do it all across the country,\" Bullock said.</p><p>             -- Last year, Bullock said he became the first governor to issue an executive order that requires all state government contractors to disclose their political spending and efforts to exert influence. A push to do something similar at the national level faltered during the final year of Barack Obama's presidency. Bullock promises to sign an order applying the same policy to federal contractors on his first day in the White House if he's elected. \"If a state can do that, think if the federal government did it,\" he said. \"They contract with almost every business in the country. At the very least, adding the sunshine and transparency will change some of the corporate behavior.\"</p><p>             -- Ultimately, though, Bullock argues, transformational change will require a change in Supreme Court jurisprudence. That's why he is open to expanding the Supreme Court to 11 justices. \"I would love to believe that the court is no longer political, but when you see what Mitch McConnell did in blocking Merrick Garland, then we have to keep all options on the table,\" he said. \"The idea of expanding the court to 11 to make up for what's been done in the last few years might be a real good way to do it.\"</p><p>             -- The governor argues that big money has corrupted every facet of federal policymaking and tilted the playing field toward corporations. For examples, he blames the GOP tax cuts, rising prescription drug prices and a failure to address climate change on the corrosive influence of deep-pocketed donors.\u00a0</p><p>             As a point of contrast, Bullock said Democrats can win routinely in a red state like Montana because of the electorate's deeply ingrained suspicion of outside money. During the Gilded Age, the Treasure State experienced some of the most flagrant and odious corruption in American history. William Clark, one of the richest men in America, was caught bribing Montana state legislators to appoint him to the U.S. Senate in 1899. This helped create momentum for what became the 17th Amendment, which mandated the direct election of senators. It eventually prompted reforms in the state, including the Corrupt Practices Act that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down five years ago.</p><p>\"At the turn of the century, there were these Copper Kings - wealthy mining barons who literally spent so much money in our system that every local, state and federal office were controlled by them,\" Bullock said. \"Mark Twain said William Clark buys politicians like other people buy food, and corruption smells sweet in Montana. Folks finally said enough is enough.\"</p><p>The governor hopes they'll do so again in 2020.</p><p>             MORE ON 2020:          </p><p>             -- Joe Biden's divergence from the more liberal 2020 candidates was evident during a forum in which representatives of the Poor People's Campaign grilled the hopefuls on their approaches to poverty and racism.Chelsea Janes reports: \"Biden outlined a new health-care proposal, which would build on the Affordable Care Act by increasing access for lower-income people. The former vice president's tack on health care is less sweeping than the \u00adMedicare-for-all plan embraced by some of his Democratic rivals, which they touted later onstage. ... The Rev. William Barber II, a founder of the campaign, asked attendees not to cheer or hiss but rather to greet all the candidates with polite applause. Even in this subdued setting, however, the response to Biden was noticeably muted, and he left the stage to applause that was less enthusiastic than that which greeted him.\"</p><p>             -- Biden said at a fundraiser in New York last night that 360,000 donors have given his campaign an average contribution of $55, which would mean he's raised $19.8 million. The revelation appeared unintentional. Biden's campaign earlier said it raised $6.3 million in its first 24 hours. (Michelle Ye Hee Lee and John Wagner)</p><p>             -- Top Democratic strategists worry that even their top-tier candidates are not getting their messages across because of\u00a0Trump's singular ability to dominate the news cycle.Michael Scherer reports: \"Through the first five months of the year, Trump has received about three times as much Google search interest in the United States, on average, as all his Democratic rivals put together. He has been having about 75 percent more social media interactions on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram than his rivals combined since February. And when it comes to CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel, Trump was mentioned nearly twice as often as the 23 Democrats last month.\"</p><p>             -- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) released a list this morning of 137\u00a0things she would promise to do during her first 100 days as president.Jenna Johnson reports: \"Roughly half of these promises involve reversing or counteracting actions taken by Trump and his administration; about half a dozen center on pieces of legislation that Klobuchar would introduce. The rest of the list is filled with actions that she would take using the executive power of the presidency - from directing agencies to aggressively target robocall scammers to increasing the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour to issuing a waiver so Americans can import less-expensive prescription drugs for themselves from Canada.\"</p><p>             -- House Democrats are growing more anxious about their grip on the majority\u00a0as the Trump investigations\u00a0and the noisy debate over impeachment overshadow their pocketbook agenda.Mike DeBonis reports: \"In recent weeks, Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has briefed fellow House leaders in private meetings about focus groups the committee commissioned in three key political battlegrounds. The upshot, according to four Democrats familiar with the findings, is that the public's impression of the new House majority is bound up in its battles with Trump, not in its policy agenda. That has prompted anxiety about whether the Democratic strategy to hold the House in 2020, by focusing intently on health-care costs and other kitchen-table issues, can be effective amid the president's attacks.\"</p><p>             -- Democratic National Committee Chair\u00a0Tom Perez is facing blowback not only for his management of the debate process but also for making Democratic lawmakers feel like \"second-class citizens,\"Politico's Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle report, based on interviews with more than a dozen House and Senate lawmakers:\u00a0\"Several lawmakers said they felt shunned by the DNC and fret the party is headed toward a brutal election cycle with serious divisions.\"</p><p>             -- Senate Democrats persuaded Cal Cunningham to drop out of the lieutenant governor's race to challenge Sen. Thom Tillis next year in North Carolina, which will again be a presidential battleground. He's a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and still faces two other Democrats in a primary before facing the GOP incumbent. (John Wagner)</p><p>             TRUMP'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN:          </p><p>             -- Here we go again: The president is officially kicking off his bid for a second term tonight with a huge rally in Orlando.\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker report on the palace intrigue:\u00a0</p><p>             One of the three polling firms abruptly fired by the Trump campaign this weekend was formerly owned by Kellyanne Conway: \"Of the three, only [Brett] Loyd appears to be fully on the outs. He's president and chief executive of Polling Company/WomanTrend, which was founded by Conway. The move to fire the pollsters was supported by campaign manager Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner ... There have long been tensions between Kushner and Conway             ... and advisers said the ouster ... was primarily targeted as a jab at her. ... For his part, Trump has publicly denied the existence of the internal polls showing him behind Biden, even as his campaign confirmed them. ...</p><p>             \"Trump's advisers said the president's supporters, who are expected to fill the 18,500-seat Amway Center, are not paying attention to internal machinations of the campaign and won't be swayed by early signs of turbulence. ... Trump will take the stage in Florida to make the case that the first 2\u00bd years of his administration have been about 'promises made' and 'promises kept,' advisers said. He will point to the strong U.S. economy and a slew of actions he has taken on issues including taxes, military spending and judicial appointments. ... According to two advisers who spoke with him in the past month, Trump remains bullish on his prospects and argues that polls don't capture his popularity. He has pointed to crowd sizes and the number of people who interact with him on social media.\"</p><p>             -- The bigger picture: As Trump announces, there are fresh indicators of a darkening economic outlook. \"Trump faces a number of major decisions on trade and the budget in the coming months just as the U.S. economy faces the biggest head winds of his tenure, forcing him to decide whether to recalibrate as recession fears mount for next year,\" Damian Paletta and Heather Long report. \"Trump has threatened to escalate trade conflicts with China, Mexico, the European Union and Japan, spooking business leaders and leading some to pull back investment. Similarly, budget and debt-ceiling talks with congressional leaders from both parties have sputtered, raising the possibility of another government shutdown in October.</p><p>\"The uncertainty - and a cooling global economy - led JPMorgan Chase on Monday to predict that there was a 45 percent chance the U.S. economy would enter a recession in the next year, up from 20 percent at the beginning of 2018. Also Monday, a key gauge of New York's manufacturing industry notched the biggest one-month drop ever recorded. ... The economy's softening and uncertainty around Trump's next actions are causing a delicate situation for the Fed, which is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Trump is relying on the central bank to cut interest rates to boost economic growth. But Fed officials are trying to reconcile worrisome reports about the economy with other areas of relative strength, particularly the low unemployment rate and high levels of consumer spending.\"</p><p>             -- Ahead of the G-20 summit, India lobbed a small but strategic strike against Trump in the trade war, imposing\u00a0retaliatory tariffs\u00a0on 28 products and layering in another economic stressor.\u00a0Taylor Telford reports: \"The penalties run as high as 70 percent, affecting agricultural goods such as apples, almonds and walnuts, as well as chemical and finished metal products. India said the move was 'in the public interest' following Trump's decision to revoke India's preferential trade privileges. India had been the biggest beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences, a program designed to help developing countries sell to U.S. consumers. But Trump, irritated by the United States' hefty trade deficit with New Delhi, ended India's favorable trade status on June 5.\"</p><p>             -- Steve Schale, who managed Obama's Florida effort\u00a0in 2008 and was a senior adviser in 2012, wrote a smart blog post explaining why it makes sense for Trump to launch his reelection bid in Orlando. He argues the conventional wisdom that Trump carried the Sunshine State because of his strength in the Panhandle is wrong, and he thinks winning again will depend on replicating Trump's\u00a0margins in the I-4 corridor. \"And here's one little secret - a lot of the movement in those counties come from the same voters who moved around between Obama and Trump in the Midwest, since a lot of the migration into the I-4 counties comes from that part of the US mainland,\"\u00a0Schale writes.\u00a0\"The last Republican to win the White House without Florida was Calvin Coolidge, and well, that was so long ago that Floridians at that time were still at risk of getting malaria.\"</p><p>             -- Republicans withstood the blue wave in Florida during 2018, and many Democrats there think Trump starts with the advantage: \"If you are asking me today, I would say Trump will carry Florida,\"\u00a0said Alex Sink, the 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee. \"Trump's political advisers view Florida, which packs 29 electoral votes and provided 37% of his victory margin in 2016, as trending more Republican, pointing out that Democrats currently hold just one statewide elected office,\" the\u00a0Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Alex Leary and Michael C. Bender report.\u00a0\"Trump has taken steps to strengthen his ties to Cuban voters in South Florida, rolling back his predecessor's diplomatic thaw. He has taken a tough line with Venezuela, endearing him to a small but growing number of Venezuelan voters in South Florida. 'They are not looking to win the Hispanic vote,\" [Democratic pollster Fernand] Amandi said of Republicans. 'They are looking to manage the margins and gain enough to put together a coalition with other voters to get to a majority.'\"</p><p>             -- When the president arrives this evening, at least five of his former employees - undocumented immigrants who were fired from his golf clubs -\u00a0will be there protesting. The \"Baby Trump\" blimp\u00a0will also be in the sky.\u00a0(New York Daily News)</p><p>             -- Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, Trump's lone challenger for the Republican nomination, will hold an intimate fundraiser in D.C. while Trump speaks to a capacity crowd.Robert Costa reports: \"Instead of arena rallies, most of Weld's weeks are filled with little-noticed trips to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state, where he stops by diners and living rooms to meet with voters who might remember him from when he was a neighboring governor in the 1990s. Other weeks are dotted with meetings and television appearances - he was on MSNBC on Sunday morning - where he has won occasional attention for his scathing criticism of Trump, but little else. ... The president's backers have ignored or mocked Weld since he announced his campaign in April, calling the Harvard lawyer - who can trace his family's roots to the Pilgrims - 'nothing more than a delusional elitist.' That view is shared in the West Wing, according to several Trump advisers, with Weld dismissed as a speck of lint on a black-tie tuxedo. ... When asked if there is any chance he drops out before next year's primary season, Weld said, 'No.'\"</p><p>             -- Fun flashback to 2016: Trump was discouraged from going down the now-famous golden escalator at Trump Tower when he announced.Parker reports: \"At the time, nearly every member of his nascent political team urged Trump not to ride a moving stairway down to his announcement. They fretted that it would look amateurish and not remotely presidential. At one point, George Gigicos, the campaign's director of advance, offered a compromise: that Trump instead take the elevator, give his speech and then ride the escalator back up once he was done - like a mechanical rope line, Gigicos suggested. Trump was insistent. 'No, I'm going down the escalator,' he said - an early example of him flouting the norms and conventions of politics at nearly every juncture, and often prevailing. ...\u00a0Some in Trump's orbit - including Michael Cohen, Trump's then-fixer and personal lawyer, who is serving a three-year prison term for tax evasion and campaign finance violations, among other misdeeds - pushed for a circuslike spectacle, complete with elephants and women in bikinis.\"</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- Escalation: Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan announced that he is sending approximately 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East \"for defensive purposes to address air, naval, and ground-based threats,\" hours after Iran said its stockpile of enriched uranium will surpass limits set by the 2015 international nuclear deal in 10 days.</p><p>\"While they are exasperated with Iran, the Europeans are perhaps even more annoyed with Trump, who has repeatedly tested their allegiance and trust,\" Karen DeYoung reports. \"On Iran, France, Germany and the European Union believe the U.S. president has put them in an impossible position - and made the Iranian threat far worse than it was a year ago for no good reason. Of the European partners to the deal, only Britain so far has accepted that it is 'almost certain' that Iran attached mines to the oil tankers last week. ... As the administration tries to present convincing proof, the Pentagon on Monday released several photographs it said showed Iran's involvement more clearly than a grainy video released last week. ... Trump has said repeatedly that his goal in Iran is 'no nuclear weapons' and that he does not want war. But events seem to be quickly moving in the opposite directions on both counts.\"</p><p>             -- For his part, the president called the alleged Iranian attack on the oil tankers \"very minor.\"Time's Tessa Berenson reports: \"Trump's comments, made in a nearly hour-long interview with TIME, struck a different tone than the public stance of the Pentagon and other Republicans in Washington. ... Trump said he agrees with the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Iran was behind the attack. ... But he also downplayed Iran's aggression, arguing that the country has adopted a less hostile posture towards the United States since he became president.\"</p><p>             GET SMART FAST:  </p><p>             THE IMMIGRATION WARS:          </p><p>             -- Trump, in a tweet, vowed massive immigration arrests and the removal of \"millions of illegal aliens\" starting next week.Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti report: \"Large-scale ICE enforcement operations are typically kept secret to avoid tipping off targets. In 2018, Trump and other senior officials threatened the mayor of Oakland, Calif., with criminal prosecution for alerting city residents that immigration raids were in the works. ... U.S. officials with knowledge of the preparations have said in recent days that the operation was not imminent, and ICE officials said late Monday night that they were not aware that the president planned to divulge their enforcement plans on Twitter.          </p><p>\"Executing a large-scale operation of the type under discussion requires hundreds - and perhaps thousands - of U.S. agents and supporting law enforcement personnel, as well as weeks of intelligence gathering and planning to verify addresses and locations of individuals targeted for arrest. The president's claim that ICE would be deporting 'millions' also was at odds with the reality of the agency's staffing and budgetary challenges. ICE arrests in the U.S. interior have been declining in recent months because so many agents are busy managing the record surge of migrant families across the southern border with Mexico.\"</p><p>             -- In Mexico's Ciudad Juarez, \"the American Dream has turned into hell,\"\u00a0Maria Sacchetti reports: \"More than 200 migrants were sent back to Juarez on Thursday, double the previous day, and officials expect as many as 500 migrants each day will be returned from El Paso to Juarez in coming weeks. 'We didn't expect this many, but it's our job and we're trying to handle the situation,' said Enrique Valenzuela, head of the Chihuahua State Population Council, which registers migrants in Juarez. Valenzuela said Mexico's federal government brokered the deal to accept the migrants with the White House, part of a diplomatic effort to avoid Trump's threatened tariffs on Mexican goods. 'We had no say. We had no choice.' ... Juarez has about a dozen migrant shelters - most run by churches - with room for 1,500 people. That many people could be turned away from the U.S. border every few days, and Valenzuela said the city could use 20 to 30 more shelters to house potentially thousands more migrants. ...</p><p>\"Juarez, once the world's murder capital, can be a frightening alternative for migrants who had dreamed of reuniting with friends and family in the relative safety of cities across the United States. ... Many issues surrounding the anticipated influx remain unresolved: Migrants returned to Mexico are allowed to wait there for their hearings in U.S. courts - a period that sometimes spans months - but they do not have permission to work to support themselves. Many do not have relatives there who can take them in, as they do in the United States. Some are sick and in need of doctors or hospitalization. 'What worries me is that the city and the state, we're not that prepared,' said the Rev. Javier Calvillo Salazar, who runs the city's largest migrant shelter, Casa del Migrante. 'That could plunge us into a crisis.'\"</p><p>             -- Arrests along the Mexican\u00a0border are falling, according to new figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, though officials say it's\u00a0too early to get a full picture of the impact of Trump's deal with Mexico.Nick Miroff reports: \"U.S. authorities detained more than 85,000 'family unit' members at the border in May, an average of nearly 2,800 per day. That number has declined about 13 percent since the beginning of June, a period during which Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico and the government of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador agreed to an immigration crackdown to avoid the penalty. Overall, U.S. officials say they are expecting a 15 to 20 percent decline in border arrests from May, when authorities detained more than 144,000 and migration levels reached their highest point since 2006. The portion of migrants arriving as part of a family group has reached unprecedented levels in recent months, overwhelming U.S. border authorities who say they are ill-equipped to care for so many parents with children.\"</p><p>             -- U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is planning on transferring\u00a0paperwork out of overburdened offices\u00a0to reduce wait\u00a0times for immigrants who have applied for green cards or citizenship.Abigail Hauslohner reports: \"The strategy, which will apply only to applications for permanent residency - also known as green cards - or U.S. citizenship, probably will be a welcome respite to immigrant communities in cities such as St. Paul, Minn., where some applicants wait up to two years to become citizens. Immigrants in other places could see the process lengthen. It is unclear if the plan will have an impact on the staggering application backlog that has grown during the Trump administration and has drawn a growing tide of bipartisan criticism from immigration advocates, business leaders and lawmakers.

But it will not allow new funding until those countries do more to reduce migrant flows to the U.S.The AP's Matthew Lee reports: \"The State Department said that after a review of more than $615 million in assistance that [Trump] ordered in March to be cut entirely, it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved. The remaining amount will be held in escrow pending consultations with Congress, it said. That $432 million, which comes from the 2017 budget, is being spent on health, education and poverty alleviation programs as well as anti-crime efforts that many believe help reduce migrant outflows from the impoverished Northern Triangle region.

Rashbaum and Katie Benner report: \"The letter, from Jeffrey A. Rosen, [Barr's] new top deputy, indicated that he was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York. And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney's office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers. Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority; Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch dissented. Since the 1850s, the court has allowed an exception to the Constitution's double jeopardy prohibition on the theory that federal and state governments are separate constitutional actors with their own sovereign authority. ...

Boosters say the project will ease a pipeline shortage that keeps most Alberta crude trapped there, where it trades at a discount to global oil benchmarks.

But the 78-year-old persevered and has once again proven conventional wisdom wrong, winning here and taking the lead in the latest national polls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump,\" Sanders told supporters on Tuesday night.\u00a0\"Bernie beats Trump,\" his 1,200 supporters chanted inside the Southern New Hampshire University field house. \"Bernie beats Trump.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By traditional metrics, Sanders would be widely considered the front-runner right now. That's how he sees himself and how his surrogates refer to him at his rallies. The party has moved in his direction on a litany of issues. He's built a small-dollar fundraising juggernaut. It's not clear today that any other candidate has a greater probability of securing the nomination than he does.</p><p>             In several ways, though, the results from New Hampshire offered a mixed bag for the would-be revolutionary. He deserves his due for winning, but there are also questions about his strength going into what could be a five-month slog to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee this July. Here's some of the good news, as well the bad news, for Sanders as the race moves from the Granite State to Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday:\u00a0</p><p>             1) A cause for concern: The victory was unexpectedly narrow.\u00a0</p><p>Sanders won with 25.8 percent of the vote, leading Pete Buttigieg by only 1.3 percentage points, or fewer than 4,000 votes.\u00a0</p><p>The percentage of the vote Sanders got is the lowest for any winner of the New Hampshire primary in modern history, lagging behind Jimmy Carter's 28.6 percent in 1976.</p><p>Sanders, who beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points here four years ago, made no effort to manage expectations that he'd win. He confidently predicted victory at every stop in the final days.</p><p>In 2016, Sanders received 152,193 votes in the two-way race. He's getting 74,316 votes, with 94 percent of precincts reporting as of 1 p.m. on Wednesday.</p><p>Interestingly, only 30 percent of voters in the network exit polls said they supported Sanders in 2016 - even though he got 62 percent of the vote. New Hampshire allows independents to vote in either party's primary. Republicans didn't have a competitive contest, so many unaffiliated voters took Democratic ballots.</p><p>On Tuesday, the exit polling shows Sanders won 57 percent of the group that had voted for him four years before. And he picked up 12 percent of voters who said they supported Clinton in 2016. One in five voters said they voted for neither Clinton nor Sanders in the 2016 primaries. Sanders got 14 percent of that group.\u00a0</p><p>             2) A reason to celebrate: Elizabeth Warren's collapse has sidelined Sanders's chief rival in the liberal lane and solidified his standing as the dominant progressive voice in the race.          </p><p>Both Sanders and Warren represent neighboring states to New Hampshire. But Warren's support tanked after Iowa, and the Massachusetts senator received 9.3 percent of the vote - not enough to receive a single delegate to the national convention. (It appears that Sanders will get nine delegates and Buttigieg will get six delegates out of New Hampshire.) If Warren cannot even get double digits here, where she's spent more time and money than any other state, what's the contest she thinks she'll be able to win?</p><p>Among the 21 percent of voters who described themselves as \"very liberal\" in the exit poll, half backed Sanders. Warren was second, with 19 percent. Sanders and Buttigieg tied among the 40 percent of voters who saw themselves as \"somewhat liberal,\" getting 26 percent apiece. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar essentially tied - 28 percent to 26 percent - among the third of the electorate that identified as moderate.\u00a0</p><p>             3) A cause for concern: Most Democrats do not want Sanders to be their nominee.\u00a0If you add together Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Joe Biden - the three candidates competing unabashedly in the more moderate lane - they received 52.7 percent. The self-described democratic socialist declines to formally register as a member of the Democratic Party. Democrats overwhelmingly said they'd back him over Trump, but they worry that he would lose the election.</p><p>             4) A reason to celebrate: Klobuchar's surge is good for Sanders because it divides up the moderate lane and makes it harder for Buttigieg to consolidate support.\u00a0          </p><p>She finished third, with just under 20 percent of the vote. Some Buttigieg allies apparently expressed concern at his watch party in Nashua about what they called the \"Klobucharge.\" The strong finish by the senior senator from Minnesota, who is going to New York today to fill her campaign coffers, denies Buttigieg the chance to claim that he's now the moderate to beat.</p><p>Klobuchar said she can appeal to the \"people in middle\" at her watch party: \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare is that the people in the middle, the people who have had enough of the name-calling and the mudslinging, have someone to vote for in November.\"</p><p>For now, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are likely to be more focused on each other than Sanders. \"I admired Senator Sanders when I was a high school student, and I want to congratulate him,\" the 38-year-old former mayor said at his party last night. \"I respect him greatly to this day, and I congratulate him on his strong showing tonight.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Mike Bloomberg is waiting in the wings. The former New York mayor is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to air commercials in the states that vote Super Tuesday. And he's building support. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) endorsed Bloomberg this morning. The three of them competing for similar voters works to Sanders's advantage.</p><p>             5) A cause for concern: Late deciders didn't break for Sanders.\u00a0          </p><p>Half of voters said they decided in the last few days. Sanders only got 16 percent of this group. Among the other half of the electorate, people who made up their minds earlier, 37 percent backed Sanders, according to the exits. If large numbers of people are making up their minds at the last minute, they're not likely to go for the Vermonter. He's a known commodity. This shows how it will be harder for him to grow his standing in the national polls than for some lesser-known rivals like Klobuchar. Another number to keep an eye on: Sanders won among men by nine points, but he finished third among women. He underperformed similarly with female voters in 2016, as well.</p><p>             6) A reason to celebrate: Medicare-for-all helped Sanders win the primary.\u00a0          </p><p>Health care was the biggest concern of people who voted in Tuesday's Democratic primary, by far, and Sanders fared best among people who care most about the issue. Among the 37 percent who cared most about health care, Sanders led with 31 percent.\u00a0</p><p>Six in 10 voters said they support replacing all private health insurance with a single government plan for everyone. Among that group, 39 percent backed Sanders. Buttigieg, who advocates \"Medicare for all who want it,\" followed with 22 percent. Warren was third with this group, garnering 13 percent. Her tortured efforts to back away from Sanders's Medicare-for-all bill, which she had co-sponsored, helped doom her candidacy. When she was peaking in the polls, she struggled to explain how she'd pay for the program without raising taxes on the middle class. She eventually called for a multi-year transition period that left voters on both sides of the question unsatisfied.\u00a0</p><p>Sanders trailed Buttigieg among voters who said climate change and foreign policy were the most important issues to them.</p><p>             7) A cause for concern: Sanders is not widely perceived by Democrats as electable.\u00a0          </p><p>Voters were asked in the exit poll whether they prioritize picking a candidate who agrees with them on major issues or who can beat Trump. Of the third of voters who prized agreement over electability, Sanders won about four in 10. But he got just two in 10 of those who primarily want to beat Trump, a much bigger bloc.</p><p>             8)             A reason to celebrate: Sanders has more blue-collar appeal than any of his rivals.\u00a0          </p><p>He led among union members, those without college degrees and lower-income voters. He beat Buttigieg 38 percent to 17 percent among those who earn less than $50,000-a-year and 31 percent to 24 percent among those who earn between $50,001 and $99,999. Buttigieg dominated with those make more than 100K, leading Klobuchar 34 percent to 20 percent, with Sanders in third.</p><p>One in five voters said income inequality is the issue they care about most. Sanders led Buttigieg among this constituency 34 percent to 20 percent. Biden enjoys saying that people like to call him \"Middle Class Joe,\" but he only got 6 percent of voters most concerned about income inequality. Indeed, Sanders campaign strategists spent much of the past year fretting that Biden would cut into their blue-collar base.\u00a0</p><p>             9)             A reason to celebrate: Sanders continues to dominate the youth vote.\u00a0          </p><p>He won half of voters between the ages of 18 to 29, followed by Buttigieg with 20 percent. Sanders also garnered 36 percent of voters age 30 to 44, according to the exit polling.\u00a0Sanders was a distant third among those 45-to-64 and 65+. Indeed, among seniors, who made up a quarter of the electorate, he got only 14 percent. Klobuchar prevailed among the 65-plus crowd. Older voters historically vote at higher rates.\u00a0</p><p>             10) A cause for concern: 18-to-29-year-olds made up 14 percent of the electorate on Tuesday, down from             19 percent             in the 2016 primary.          </p><p>The share of young people in the electorate declined despite assiduous outreach, including the campaign hosting a concert on the University of New Hampshire campus in Durham on Monday night, that drew 7,500 attendees.\u00a0</p><p>Bigger picture, Sanders is not bringing the numbers of new voters into the primary process that he promises he would be able to activate in the general election if he's the Democratic nominee. Sanders's theory of the case is premised on the idea that he can bring new people into the process.

The cascade of controversy began Monday, when career prosecutors handling the case recommended that a judge sentence Stone ... to between seven and nine years in federal prison. ... 'This is a horrible and very unfair situation,' Trump\u00a0wrote early Tuesday. 'The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!' Hours later, a senior Justice Department official told reporters that the agency's leadership was 'shocked' by the recommendation of a seven-to-nine-year sentence and would soon revise it.\u00a0...\u00a0</p><p>\"One by one, the career prosecutors, two of whom had worked on [Bob] Mueller's investigation, filed notices in court of their intention to leave the case. Though none of the prosecutors gave a reason, their asking to do so was highly unusual and suggested they could not ethically affix their names to the government's revised position. ...\u00a0Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that the White House did not communicate with the agency on Monday or Tuesday about the Stone case, and that the decision to reverse course was made before Trump's tweet. Trump told reporters later Tuesday, 'I have not been involved in it at all,' though in the same remarks he called the career prosecutors' initial recommendation 'an insult to our country.' ... Jonathan Kravis, one of the prosecutors on the Stone case, wrote in a court filing that he had resigned as an assistant U.S. attorney, leaving government altogether. Three others - Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, Adam Jed and Michael Marando - filed notices with the judge saying 'please notice the withdrawal' from the case. ...\u00a0</p><p>             \"The decision to file a new sentencing memo was made by officials in the attorney general's office and the deputy attorney general's office, according to a senior Justice Department official.\u00a0The official could not point to another instance of Justice Department headquarters overruling and replacing a sentencing memorandum a day after a filing ... Hours before the [original] filing was due Monday, [Timothy] Shea, the [interim head of the D.C. U.S. attorney's office] and a former close adviser to [Attorney General Bill] Barr, had not made a final decision on Stone's sentencing recommendation ... In their Monday filing, prosecutors argued that more time should be added to Stone's sentence because of his extensive criminal conduct, which stretched over two years, and because they say he obstructed the prosecution of the case after he was charged. In a Tuesday filing from Shea, ... the government argued that those enhancements were overkill, noting that Stone's victim has asked for leniency for him and did not view the statement as an actual threat.\"</p><p>             -- Almost simultaneously, Trump decided to revoke the nomination to a top Treasury Department post of his former U.S. attorney in the District, Jessie Liu, who supervised the Stone case when it went to trial.\u00a0Hsu, Dawsey and Barrett report:\u00a0\"Liu, 47, served more than two years in the politically sensitive post of top federal prosecutor in the nation's capital and was Trump's first nominee to the position, serving from September 2017 until Jan. 31. In the job, Liu oversaw late-stage court proceedings for top Trump aides and Mueller defendants, including Trump's 2016 deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, as well as [Stone's] November trial and conviction. However, over the past two weeks, coinciding with Liu's departure, the U.S. attorney's office has\u00a0changed\u00a0its sentencing stances\u00a0in both Flynn\u00a0and\u00a0Stone's\u00a0cases, with prosecutors moving from stiffer sentencing recommendations to more lenient ones. Emerging accounts of the circumstances surrounding Liu's departure from the administration cast those decisions in a new light. ...\u00a0</p><p> \"Trump has been lobbied extensively against Liu by people who do not like her handling of the D.C. office - particularly as it relates to the Mueller probe, an administration official said. The decision to withdraw the nomination was made Tuesday afternoon, the official said. ... A third person familiar with the situation ... said Liu's nomination was opposed vocally by Barbara Ledeen, a conservative operative and Republican Senate staffer unhappy about [Michael] Flynn's prosecution for lying to the FBI.\u00a0... The person said Ledeen had made little headway before the recent storm over Stone's sentencing, calling it a turning point. Treasury officials believe Trump himself made the call to withdraw Liu because her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee was set for Thursday, and Trump was concerned she would be asked about the case ... Liu had no role in Stone's sentencing recommendation, having left office before it was sent to supervisors for approval, several people said.\"</p><p>             -- The four career prosecutors who withdrew from the Stone case did so after finding out from Fox News that Barr's office planned to withdraw the sentencing recommendation, per the Times: \"As is customary in prominent prosecutions, the line prosecutors on the Stone case discussed their proposed sentencing recommendation with senior officials. But they apparently came to no clear agreement before the document was filed in court, an outcome that one Justice Department official blamed on a breakdown in management.\"\u00a0</p><p>             -- The week of Trump's acquittal was Fox News Channel's best in the ratings since the weeks when he was elected and inaugurated.\u00a0(AP)\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Under Barr's iron fist, \"it appears no corner of the Justice Department can escape perversion,\"\u00a0laments             columnist Dana Milbank             : \"In a new grant award, senior Justice officials rejected the recommendations of career officials and decided to deny grants to highly rated Catholic Charities in Palm Beach, Fla., and Chicanos Por La Causa in Phoenix. Instead,\u00a0Reuters reported,\u00a0they gave more than $1 million combined to lower-rated groups called the Lincoln Tubman Foundation and Hookers for Jesus. Why? Well, it turns out the head of the Catholic Charities affiliate had been active with Democrats and the Phoenix group had opposed President Trump's immigration policies. By contrast, Hookers for Jesus is run by a Christian conservative and the Lincoln Tubman group was launched by a relative of a Trump delegate to the 2016 convention. That Catholic Charities has been replaced by Hookers for Jesus says much about Barr's Justice Department. Friends of Trump are rewarded. Opponents of Trump are punished. And the nation's law enforcement apparatus becomes Trump's personal plaything.\"</p><p>             -- As Trump escalated his campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies, Republican senators shrugged.\u00a0Philip Rucker and Paul Kane report: Trump railed \"in the Oval Office about a decorated combat veteran who testified about the president's conduct with Ukraine and suggesting the Defense Department should consider disciplining him. 'The military can handle him any way they want,' Trump said of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was\u00a0ousted from his position\u00a0on the National Security Council last Friday and reassigned to the Pentagon. Asked whether he was recommending the military take disciplinary action against Vindman for his House testimony in the impeachment proceedings, Trump replied, 'They're going to certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that.' ... Republicans who control the Senate resigned themselves this week to the reality that they are unable to check or even influence Trump, even as some GOP strategists are warning that the president's actions threaten the party's Senate majority by complicating the home-state politics for a quintet of endangered incumbents.</p><p>\"One of them, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), said last week that she believed Trump had learned 'a pretty big lesson' by being impeached. But this week she said she had been so 'concerned' about Trump's desire to punish two impeachment witnesses, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Vindman, that she contacted the White House. ...\u00a0Asked what senators could do to rein in Trump, she replied, 'I called to try to prevent the action' ... Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said that they tried to save Sondland, a major GOP donor, from the embarrassment of being fired on the same day as Vindman. ... 'I agreed with the decision on Vindman,' Tillis said. 'I just felt like having the two have some distance would have been appropriate.'\"</p><p>             -- Trump plans to ditch another official over her role in impeachment.\u00a0From the New York Post: \"The White House is expected to pull the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be the Pentagon's comptroller and chief financial officer in the latest staffing fallout from [Trump's] impeachment ... McCusker resisted the president's directive to stall about $250 million in military aid to Ukraine and her emails protesting the delay were\u00a0leaked in January\u00a0to the blog Just Security ahead of Trump's Senate trial. ... It's unclear if a final decision has been made on the timing of the nomination withdrawal. It's also unclear how the withdrawal would impact McCusker's current role as acting comptroller and CFO of the Pentagon.\"\u00a0</p><p>             -- Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) has emerged as a top contender to be the next director of national intelligence. He's being pushed by national security adviser Robert O'Brien.\u00a0From the Times: \"Joseph Maguire, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, has\u00a0filled in as the acting director of national intelligence since Dan Coats resigned\u00a0in August. But under current law limiting the duration of postings for acting cabinet-level officials, Mr. Maguire must step down next month. ... What is not clear, however, is whether the president sees Mr. Maguire's role in handling the anonymous whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine that helped prompt the impeachment inquiry as an asset or a liability. Mr. Maguire followed the advice of administration lawyers and initially blocked the complaint from being sent to Congress ... But soon after, he engineered an agreement to provide the complaint to Congress. That move ... helped prompt the impeachment inquiry. ... Mr. Stewart, like other Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, vigorously defended Mr. Trump during impeachment hearings in the fall that focused on the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. And he has been sharply critical of the handling by the Justice Department and F.B.I. of an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election.\"</p><p>             -- Speaking of Utahns, Sen. Mitt Romney (R) said the Senate GOP has already moved on from his vote last week to convict Trump of abuse of power during the impeachment trial.\u00a0Paul Kane reports: \"Signaling he wants to be a team player, Romney flew home to Salt Lake City for meetings last Thursday - a day after the Senate vote - and then to Palm Beach, Fla., for a National Republican Senatorial Committee gathering ... He said there was no awkwardness at the fundraising retreat or Tuesday's [GOP luncheon], also attended by [Mike] Pence.\" Things with the president, though, remain tense.

An initial round of tests came back negative, and the people returned to a quarantine site at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. Further testing revealed, however, that one of them was infected. A CDC spokeswoman, Kristen Nordlund, said Tuesday that blood samples from the three patients were inadvertently omitted from a large test run because they were incorrectly labeled. ...

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing next week for continuing negotiations to extract the United States from the costliest trade war since the 1930s. As the administration shifts toward reelection mode, the president seems increasingly willing to prioritize his 2020 hopes over his hardball tactics and protectionist impulses.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congress still needs to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA, and Trump's team is working to emphasize its benefits. The deal, as agreed to last year, could transform North American auto production by mandating that 40 percent of each vehicle be produced by workers earning $16 per hour - something aimed at steering jobs away from lower-wage Mexican workers.</p><p>Pence will tour Ford's Dearborn truck plant at 1 p.m. and then speak to auto industry leaders about the deal at Motor City Solutions at 2:30 p.m. Both of the VP's events are in the congressional district represented by Debbie Dingell (D), who is undecided on the deal. \"I will tell you: I hear more about trade than I do the Mueller report,\" Dingell said in a phone interview last night.          </p><p>She wants changes before she'll commit to supporting the USMCA, but Dingell said she'll probably get on board if the United Automobile Workers union endorses it. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has been pushing for negotiators from all three countries to return to the bargaining table to strengthen the enforcement provisions related to labor.</p><p>Dingell remains angry about the decision by General Motors over the winter to close several plants across the heartland while increasing production south of the border. \"What in this deal will prevent GM from putting another Blazer plant in Mexico like they did last July? That's not okay with me,\" said Dingell, who spent 32 years as an executive at the auto giant. \"How do you have a smart trade policy that levels the playing field without increasing the cost?\"</p><p>             -- Trump's path to victory probably depends on another sweep of the industrial Midwest, from Michigan and Wisconsin to Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the White House seems very mindful of that. Pence has been blitzing these battlegrounds to talk about trade. This is the vice president's ninth visit to Michigan alone since taking office, per the Detroit News. Trump held a raucous rally last month in Grand Rapids. He's skipping the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday to hold a rally in Wisconsin.</p><p>             -- Meanwhile, Trump has directed his negotiators to hammer out a deal with China that will remove the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the world's two biggest economies, months after the temporary truce of sorts between Trump and Xi Jinping.</p><p>             Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, says he's \"cautiously optimistic\" an agreement can be inked soon. \"We're not there yet, but we've made a heck of a lot of progress,\" Kudlow told reporters yesterday at the National Press Club, per Reuters.</p><p>Mnuchin will be accompanied in China on Tuesday by U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer. Vice Premier Liu He, who is representing the Chinese, has agreed to lead a delegation to Washington for an additional round of negotiations starting May 8. \"The subjects of next week's discussions will cover trade issues including intellectual property, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases, and enforcement,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement last night.</p><p>             -- The S&amp;P 500 hit an all-time high yesterday, buoyed in part by the signs of progress in the trade talks with China. \"The S&amp;P 500 has now recovered all of the ground it lost last fall, gaining 24.8% since it hit a bottom on Christmas Eve,\" per the AP. \"Investors are more confident in the prospects for steady, if slower, growth. And they've been encouraged by an increasingly hands-off Federal Reserve, which has signaled this year that it may not raise interest rates at all in 2019 after seven increases the prior two years. Traders are also feeling more optimistic about the global economy. In China, economic growth held steady at 6.4% in the first quarter of the year as increased government efforts to stem a slowdown gained traction. In the U.S., job growth rebounded in March following a surprisingly weak February.\"</p><p>             -- The president has often telegraphed that he'll do whatever it takes to keep the economy juiced enough to avoid a slowdown before November 2020, including attacking his own pick for Fed chair. Earlier this month, Trump threatened to close the entire southern border and told reporters that border security \"is more important to me than the USMCA.\" But he backed off that threat under pressure from the business community and in the face of warnings from his own top advisers that such a move would cause economic calamity that could imperil his reelection. Now his focus is on making the deal look like a big win.</p><p>             -- The Trump tariffs are best viewed as the equivalent of tax hikes on American consumers, who suffer when higher costs are passed along to them. An approaching election therefore creates stronger political incentives to roll them back.</p><p>             The tariffs that Trump imposed last year on foreign washing machines, for example, have cost U.S. consumers $815,000 for every job created, according to a new study by economists at the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve. There was the expected rise in retail prices from foreign manufacturers such as Samsung and LG. \"Then domestic manufacturers followed suit, simply because they could,\" Chris Ingraham explains. \"All told, the research shows, U.S. consumers are spending an additional $1.5 billion a year on washers and dryers as a result of the tariffs. That's an extra $86 for each washing machine and $92 for each dryer. And less than 10 percent of that goes to the U.S. treasury - about $82.2 million.\"</p><p>             -- Polling underscores the political imperative for Trump to look like he's making headway on winding down the trade wars, which he once declared would be \"easy\" to win.Last summer, the Chicago Council found that 82 percent of Americans believe international trade is good for the U.S. economy and that 63 percent thought that NAFTA is good for the U.S. economy. Last spring, Pew Research Center found that 56 percent of Americans think free trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries have generally been a good thing.</p><p>             -- It was overshadowed by the Mueller report, but an independent analysis released last Thursday by the International Trade Commission showed that the USMCA will have a marginally positive impact on the U.S. economy, boosting output by 0.35 percent and delivering an even smaller gain to the labor market.The 379-page report was mandated by Congress.</p><p>\"The largest gains would arise from eliminating 'uncertainty' by preventing future barriers to cross-border e-commerce, services and investments,\" David Lynch reports. \"Notably, the deal would increase auto parts production and employment, key administration goals. But the narrow benefits for the auto sector would come at the expense of the broader economy, making overall U.S. production more expensive, reducing exports, and denting wages and employment, the report said. The administration sought to preempt the report, releasing an assessment that concluded the deal would create 76,000 auto jobs over the next five years and trigger $34 billion in new auto plant investments and $23 billion in added auto parts purchases.\"</p><p>             -- For her part, Nancy Pelosi continues pressing the White House to reopen negotiations to add worker protections before she'll bring the measure up for a vote on the House floor. She said she also won't take up the deal until Mexico changes its labor laws. \"Exploiting workers in Mexico is not good for workers in the United States,\" the speaker said earlier this month. \"No enforcement, no treaty,\" she added.</p><p>Dingell said she agrees with Pelosi's demands. \"That's step one for everybody,\" she said.</p><p>             -- This legislative process could drag on for several more months, as top congressional Republicans have their own concerns. They also want Trump to remove tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico before they vote on the deal.</p><p>             -- This is all playing out against the backdrop of presidential politics and a Democratic primary that's now in full swing: Bernie Sanders used a Michigan foray\u00a0the weekend before last to emphasize his opposition to the USMCA. The Vermont senator won a shocking upset over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary in Michigan, a harbinger of her vulnerability there in the general election. Now he's trying to appeal to disaffected Trump voters in places like Macomb County who had voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. Sanders sees the president's failure to deliver on his big promises vis-\u00e0-vis trade deals and manufacturing jobs as a lever to do so.</p><p>             Sanders said Trump should \"go back to the drawing board\" on reworking NAFTA. \"Do not send it to Congress unless it includes strong and swift enforcement mechanisms to raise the wages of workers and stop corporations from outsourcing American jobs to Mexico,\" he said at a rally.</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- The U.S. Coast Guard officer\u00a0accused of planning a widespread terrorist attack on politicians and media personalities in D.C. was driven by his \"views on race,\" prosecutors allege in a new filing.Lynh Bui reports: Lt. Christopher P. Hasson, 49,\u00a0\"conducted Internet searches for the best gun to kill black people and the home addresses of two Supreme Court justices before going to firearms sales websites. [The filing doesn't identify which justices.]\u00a0... Hasson is set to appear in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., on Thursday for a review of his detention status. ...\u00a0Hasson searched for 'white homeland,' 'when are whites going to wake up,'\u00a0and 'please god let there be a race war' in 2017. ...\u00a0His federal public defender has argued that the government has no proof Hasson intended to launch an attack and that it would be inappropriate to keep him in jail on drug and weapons charges.\"</p><p>             -- Eight pedestrians were injured in Sunnyvale, Calif., after a speeding driver may have deliberately plowed into\u00a0a crowd, police said. The driver, identified as an adult male, is in custody. All eight people, who were walking through a crosswalk or standing nearby, were transported to\u00a0hospitals, Capt. Jim Choi of the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety told Allyson Chiu. The youngest victim is 13 years old. Police have not offered updates on their conditions. Based on a preliminary investigation, Choi said, \"it looks like this may have been an intentional act by the driver.\"</p><p>             GET SMART FAST:  </p><p>             THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:          </p><p>             -- In an interview with The Washington Post last night, Trump said he's opposed to current and former White House staffers providing testimony to congressional panels in the wake of the Mueller report.Robert Costa, Tom Hamburger, Josh Dawsey and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \"Trump said that complying with congressional requests was unnecessary after the White House cooperated with [special counsel Bob Mueller]. ... 'There is no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it's very partisan - obviously very partisan,' Trump said. ... White House lawyers plan to tell attorneys for administration witnesses called by the House that they will be asserting executive privilege over their testimony ...

Trump has been\u00a0so taken with pictures of himself\u00a0published in newspapers that aides have requested high-quality prints on his behalf, and the president has retweeted images from photojournalists on social media.\"          </p><p>             THE BRAVE NEW WORLD, BROUGHT TO YOU BY BIG TECH:          </p><p>             -- The hacking of Nest cameras has showcased how tech companies balance user convenience against security risks. The security cameras are easy targets for hackers, which has led to some high-profile incidents of virtual home invasion. One parent complained that hackers played pornography through the intercom of her toddler's baby monitor. But Nest has been hesitant to increase security measures that would make the cameras less user-friendly. (Reed Albergotti)</p><p>             -- During a closed-door meeting with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Trump accused the platform of tampering with his follower count.Tony Romm reports: \"The meeting came as Trump continues to\u00a0attack\u00a0the tech industry, threatening to regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter out of concern that they censor conservatives online - an allegation those companies fiercely deny. ... Trump said he had heard from fellow conservatives who had lost followers for unclear reasons as well. But Twitter long has explained that follower figures fluctuate as the company takes action to remove fraudulent spam accounts. In the meeting, Dorsey stressed that point, noting even he had lost followers as part of Twitter's work to enforce its policies.\"</p><p>             -- Google received its first Federal Aviation Administration approval to operate a fleet of drones that will regularly deliver consumer goods.\u00a0The Wall Street Journal's Andy Pasztor reports: The move \"could jump-start various companies' commercial drone services nationwide. ... Industry officials in the past have said it was likely to take until 2020 or 2021 for the FAA to implement wide-ranging drone rules establishing a framework for package deliveries.\"</p><p>             -- Ireland is the designated lead regulator of data privacy guidelines that Europe imposed last year. But instead of enforcing any action against big tech, Ireland is catering to it.\u00a0Politico's Nicholas Vinocur reports: \"Despite its vows to beef up its threadbare regulatory apparatus, Ireland has a long history of catering to the very companies it is supposed to oversee, having wooed top Silicon Valley firms to the Emerald Isle with promises of low taxes, open access to top officials, and help securing funds to build glittering new headquarters. ... Ireland's failure to safeguard huge stores of personal information looms larger now that the country is the primary regulator responsible for protecting the health information, email addresses, financial records, relationship status, search histories and friend lists for hundreds of millions of Americans, Europeans and other users around the globe.\"</p><p>             -- After the release of Mueller's report, more than 5,000 pro-Trump Twitter bots pushed the claim that the investigation was a \"Russiagate hoax.\"\u00a0NBC News's Ben Collins reports: \"These bots, however, did not appear to come from Russia. Instead, the bots had ties to a social media operation that previously pushed messages backing the government of Saudi Arabia and were connected to a person who claimed to be a private social media consultant, according to internet domain and account registration records. The bots, which were created last November and December, were pulled down by Twitter on Sunday night for breaking the social network's rules against 'manipulation,' the company said.\"</p><p>             SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:          </p><p>A New York Times columnist reacted to Trump's latest attacks on the newspaper:</p><p>Bernie took heat for saying that inmates should be allowed to vote.

On Thursday, Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee canceled his confirmation hearing 90 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. On Sunday night, the Pentagon announced that Tata has withdrawn and, instead, has been \"designated as the official performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy.\" That circumvents Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Tata's nomination was controversial following statements he made that included calling former president Barack Obama a 'terrorist leader,' suggesting that former CIA director John Brennan should prepare for execution or suck 'on a pistol,' and saying that Islam is the 'most oppressive violent religion I know of,'\" Dan Lamothe reports. \"Tata retired as a brigadier general in 2009 under a cloud after the Army inspector general found that he had at least two extramarital affairs, despite adultery being a crime in the military.\"</p><p>Contrary to the president's claims, Article II does not give him the power to do whatever he wants. A hallmark of Trump's tenure has been his disdain for the \"advice and consent\" function given to the Senate for appointments by Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist 76 that requiring the Senate to confirm a president's pick for important jobs was a critical \"check\" on the executive branch \"to prevent the appointment of unfit characters.\"</p><p>Trump has said he loves keeping people in \"acting\" positions, including in the Cabinet. It also circumvents congressional oversight. The president has installed loyalists and ideologues into critical positions when it was clear they could not get confirmed by the GOP-controlled Senate for the job, such as former acting director of national intelligence Ric Grenell.</p><p>The president's use of what's known as delegation authority has received less attention, but it is perhaps more of an affront to the constitutional principle of advice and consent. There is not a limit on how long Tata could hold his new job, for example. Trump has had a deputy director exercising the authority of director for the National Park Service, a senior official performing the duties of the director at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and so on. The administration has done this across the government. The higher-level position goes unfilled so that someone in a position that is not Senate-confirmed can call the shots.</p><p>A federal judge ruled in March that Trump's appointment last year of Ken Cuccinelli to be head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was a violation of federal vacancy laws, and that Cuccinelli lacked the authority to issue policy directives tightening asylum rules. \"In his ruling, Judge Moss referred to a long-running gag on The Office, the classic sitcom about bureaucratic absurdity, about the difference between 'assistant regional manager' and 'assistant to the regional manager,'\" NPR noted at the time.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, William Perry Pendley. Bullock, who is running for Senate, asks a judge for an junction to oust Pendley, who has essentially run the agency for more than a year, on the grounds that he cannot work as acting director now that he's been formally nominated for the job.</p><p>Tata has served since this spring as a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Mark Esper in an unconfirmed capacity. The Pentagon said in its Sunday night statement that Tata \"looks forward to continuing to help implement the President's National Security agenda.\"</p><p>Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, complained that vacant positions at the Defense Department are at a record high, which he described as a \"threat\" to national security. \"If an appointee cannot gain the support of the Senate, as is clearly the case with Tata, then the president should not put that person into an identical temporary role,\" said Smith. \"This evasion of scrutiny makes our government less accountable and prioritizes loyalty over competence.\"</p><p>Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, condemned the appointment of Tata as \"an offensive, destabilizing move,\" and called on his Republican colleagues to demand the White House remove Tata from his new post. \"If President Trump's goal is to hollow out, politicize, and undermine the Pentagon the way he has the State Department and Intelligence Community, then mission accomplished,\" Reed said in a statement. \"This method of appointment is an insult to our troops, professionals at the Pentagon, the Senate, and the American people.Clearly, President Trump wants people who will swear allegiance to him over the Constitution.... The American people must not grow numb to the dizzying dysfunction of this Administration and the Senate should not allow moves like this to go unchecked.\"          </p><p>Trump had pressed Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to give Tata a hearing. Inhofe said in a statement last week that he had told Trump by phone on Wednesday night that \"it wouldn't serve any useful purpose to have a hearing at this point\" and that Trump had agreed.</p><p>             Inhofe said he supports the administration's latest move. \"While I have always stressed the need to have Senate-confirmed leadership in top Pentagon positions, I believe it is within the President's authority toappoint DoD officials when and as appropriate,\" he said in a statement on Monday afternoon. \"These are clearly critical positions within the Department where a full bench is needed.\"          </p><p>The post that Tata had been nominated for opened up when Trump dismissed John Rood in February after he opposed the Trump administration withholding aid money to Ukraine, an issue that was at the center of Trump's impeachment by the House. Rood was the top Pentagon official who certified that Ukraine had sufficiently met its anti-corruption targets in order to receive military aid as required by U.S. law. In an email to Esper a few hours after Trump's July 25, 2019, call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Rood wrote that \"placing a hold on security assistance at this time would jeopardize this unique window of opportunity and undermine our defense priorities with a key partner in the strategic competition with Russia.\" The money was held anyway.</p><p>Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said keeping someone like Tata in place when members of the president's own party are opposed to him is scandalous. \"To me, avoiding the Senate's explicit advice and consent provision to install cronies for whom he has received little if any senatorial advice, and absolutely no consent, is an impeachable offense,\" Hauser said. \"At the very least, appointees like Tata reflect Trump's antipathy toward good governance and provide context for America's worst-in-the-developed world response to covid-19.\"</p><p>             \"Public health experts are discussing among themselves a new worry: that hopes for a vaccine may be soaring too high. The confident depiction by politicians and companies that a vaccine is imminent and inevitable may give people unrealistic beliefs about how soon the world can return to normal - and even spark resistance to simple strategies that can tamp down transmission and save lives in the short term,\" Carolyn Johnson reports. \"Two coronavirus vaccines entered the final stages of human testing last week, a scientific speed record that prompted top government health officials to utter words such as 'historic' and 'astounding.' Pharmaceutical executives predicted to Congress in July that vaccines might be available as soon as October, or before the end of the year. ...But best-case scenarios have failed to materialize throughout the pandemic, and experts - who believe wholeheartedly in the power of vaccines - foresee a long path ahead. '             It seems, to me, unlikely that a vaccine is an off-switch or a reset button where we will go back to pre-pandemic times,' said Yonatan Grad, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and immunology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Or, as Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen puts it, 'It's not like we're going to land in Oz.' ...          </p><p>             \"Deploying the vaccine to people in the United States and around the world will test and strain distribution networks, the supply chain, public trust and global cooperation. It will take months or, more likely, years to reach enough people to make the world safe. ...For those who do get a vaccine as soon as shots become available, protection won't be immediate - it takes weeks for the immune system to call up full platoons of disease-fighting antibodies. And many vaccine technologies will require a second shot weeks after the first to raise immune defenses.Immunity could be short-lived or partial, requiring repeated boosters that strain the vaccine supply or require people to keep social distancing and wearing masks even after they've received their shots. And if a vaccine works less well for some groups of people, if swaths of the population are reluctant to get a vaccine or if there isn't enough to go around, some people will still get sick even after scientists declare victory on a vaccine - which could help foster a false impression it doesn't work.\"          </p><p>             \"Under constant pressure from a White House anxious for good news and a public desperate for a silver bullet to end the crisis, the government's researchers are fearful of political intervention in the coming months and are struggling to ensure that the government maintains the right balance between speed and rigorous regulation, according to interviews with administration officials, federal scientists and outside experts,\" the Times reports.\"The desire to find a way to return to normal life is powerful and transcends partisan politics and borders. On Sunday, Russia announced that it planned to start a nationwide inoculation campaign in October with a vaccine that had yet to complete clinical trials, the latest evidence of the global potential for cutting corners.             Despite concerted efforts by the Trump administration and a bevy of pharmaceutical companies it is working with, the original October target has slipped, with the administration now pushing to have hundreds of millions of doses available by the end of the year or early 2021.          </p><p>             \"But experts inside and outside the government still say they fear the White House will push the Food and Drug Administration to overlook insufficient data and give at least limited emergency approval to a vaccine, perhaps for use by specific groups like front-line health care workers, before the vote on Nov. 3. 'There are a lot of people on the inside of this process who are very nervous about whether the administration is going to reach their hand into the Warp Speed bucket, pull out one or two or three vaccines, and say, \"We've tested it on a few thousand people, it looks safe, and now we are going to roll it out,\"             '              said Dr. Paul A. Offit of the University of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory committee. '             They are really worried about that. And they should be.'\"          </p><p>             Testing czar Brett Giroir said it's \"time to move on\" from hydroxychloroquine.\"Most physicians and prescribers are evidence-based, and they're not influenced by whatever is on Twitter or anything else. And the evidence just does not show hydroxychloroquine is effective right now,\" the assistant health secretary said on              NBC's              \"Meet the Press.\" \"We need to move on from that and talk about what is effective.\"          </p><p>             Debbie Birx said the pandemic has entered a \"new phase.\" \"What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread,\"the White House coronavirus task force coordinator              told CNN             , noting that it's as rampant in rural areas as urban ones.

Republicans have proposed reducing the $600 weekly payment to $200, or adopting a formula that would amount to replacing about two-thirds of a worker's wages before they were unemployed. ... Pelosi suggested Democrats could be open to an approach that reduced the $600 over time as the unemployment rate declines, an idea that has been embraced by a number of congressional Democrats. ...</p><p>\"For many low-wage workers, the benefits have amounted to a bump in pay from what they were making at previous jobs. Studies have estimated between 40 and 68 percent of people on unemployment insurance are making more with the extra $600 than they were previously at work. But some preliminary studies on the issue have not found the temporary bump is a disincentive for a noticeable number of workers. A recent study by three Yale economists found workers receiving the extra benefits returned to work at roughly the same rate as others, finding 'no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work.'\"</p><p>             Trump is considering possible options for unilateral action if his negotiators cannot reach a deal with Congress.

He added that he was also \"guided by the principles of fairness.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge,\" the special counsel said in his first public comments since being appointed two years ago. \"If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"</p><p>Since filing their detailed report, Mueller and his team have been frustrated by what they perceive as a lack of understanding, even among lawmakers, about DOJ guidelines. \"Under that policy, Mueller and his team also think it would be improper for Mueller to say that the president would be charged with obstruction were it not for the Justice Department policy, because saying that would amount to a criminal accusation against the president,\" Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. \"Mueller's team came to believe that making any sort of impeachment referral to Congress also would fall under the category of accusing the president of a crime, according to people familiar with their discussions. For those reasons, Mueller has been guarded ... and wants to avoid being drawn into a back-and-forth in congressional testimony that could be tantamount to accusing the president of a crime.\"</p><p>             Starr opened his report by advocating for Bill Clinton's impeachment. \"There is substantial and credible information supporting the following eleven possible grounds for impeachment,\" he wrote.</p><p>A Republican investigating a Democratic president, Starr was assisted by a retinue of known anti-Clinton partisans, including a young Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>             -- Starr testified before the House Judiciary Committee in 1998. Mueller, a registered Republican, has no desire to play along with House Democrats who want him to be the star witness of a televised hearing. In fact, the primary goal of his remarks on Wednesday appeared to be obviating the need to appear before Congress. \"The report is my testimony,\" Mueller said, adding that he's resigning from the Justice Department and returning to private life. \"I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner.\" If compelled to appear, Mueller emphasized that he \"would not go beyond\" what's in the report. \"We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself,\" he said.</p><p>             -- This is a blow for Democrats, who are now struggling internally with how aggressively to pursue Mueller's testimony. As a House Democratic leadership aide put it to Rachael Bade: \"There are tons of benefits to the visual. ... To animate and dramatize the report elevates public awareness of it.\"</p><p>             -- During his investigation, Mueller opted not to force a legal confrontation with Trump to secure an in-person interview. The special counsel agreed to accept written answers that he knew could be vetted carefully by lawyers, and he accepted the president's refusal to engage on questions related to obstruction of justice.</p><p>             -- Other prosecutors also might have felt more compelled to vocally defend their integrity, as well as the government lawyers who work for them. Trump has repeatedly sought to cast doubt on the integrity of Mueller's probe, characterizing it once again this morning as both a \"WITCH HUNT\" and \"The Greatest Presidential Harassment in history.\" Mueller nodded only briefly yesterday to the professionalism of the career civil servants who assisted him. He did not directly push back against Trump's two years of attempts to delegitimize and politicize his investigation. Instead, he seems content to let the final product speak for itself.</p><p>             -- Mueller is at the end of his career.             The Vietnam veteran, on what's clearly his final tour of duty in government, didn't need a platform to make a name for himself. The 74-year-old was \"the adult in the room,\" explains Marc Fisher. \"He delivered his message in the way he has conducted his career - by the book, in a code designed to inform rather than inflame. Anyone expecting the special counsel to let his hair down and speak from the heart about what he really thought of Trump did not know who Mueller is. A decorated Marine, a career prosecutor who wears a white shirt to work every day, Mueller rose through the government and became FBI director and a valued adviser to presidents of both parties not by speaking his mind but by proving his reserve.</p><p>\"Until now, Mueller had played the role of the sphinx of the capital. ... When he finally spoke, Mueller did so in a voice thinned by age, but strong in its controlled rectitude. ... After Mueller finished, a reporter tried to elicit something beyond the written statement, but the special counsel said, 'No questions,' turned, and strode out of the room.\"</p><p>             -- First in the 202: Republicans for the Rule of Law, an initiative spearheaded by lifelong conservatives who are critical of Trump, has produced a five-minute testimonial video with three former federal prosecutors who are registered Republicans discussing how, if Trump was not president, they believe he would have been charged with obstruction of justice, based on the information in the Mueller report.          </p><p>The video features Donald Ayer, Paul Rosenzweig and Jeffrey Harris. Ayer served as the deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Rosenzweig was a senior counsel to Starr and deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security under George W. Bush. Harris served as deputy associate attorney general under Ronald Reagan and was a principal assistant to Rudy Giuliani when he was in the Justice Department.</p><p>The three are among the more than 1,000 former prosecutors who have signed onto a statement asserting that Mueller's findings would have produced obstruction charges against Trump if he wasn't the president.\u00a0</p><p>\"These veterans of the Reagan and Bush Administrations are reminding us that the law applies the same to everyone, even the president,\" said Chris Truax, a spokesman for Republicans for the Rule of Law, which produced the video in partnership with Protect Democracy, a nonprofit whose charge is to hold the executive branch accountable. \"Republicans and all Americans need to listen.\" (Watch the video here.)</p><p>             -- \"Wednesday's press conference was consistent with ... a persona that frustrates anti-Trump partisans who dreamed of [Mueller] as an avenging superhero,\" former federal prosecutor Ken White writes in the Atlantic. \"Mueller is a man out of time. This is the age of alternatively factual tweets and sound bites; he's a by-the-book throwback who expects Americans to read and absorb carefully worded 400-page reports. Has he met us?\"</p><p>             -- Actor Robert De Niro, who has played Mueller on \"Saturday Night Live,\" pleads with the special counsel to testify before Congress in an op-ed for today's New York Times. \"I know you're as uncomfortable in the spotlight as the president is out of it,\" De Niro writes. \"I know you don't want to become part of the political spectacle ... I understand why you'd want to do it away from the public glare. But the country needs to hear your voice. Your actual voice. And not just because you don't want them to think that your actual voice sounds like Robert De Niro reading from cue cards, but because this is the report your country asked you to do, and now you must give it authority and clarity without, if I may use the term, obstruction.\"</p><p>             -- Here are five other takeaways from the speech:          </p><p>             1. Mueller emphasized how hard he leaned on opinions from the OLC that were released to protect presidents during past crises and that have not been tested in the courts. \"The Special Counsel's Office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,\" he said.</p><p>\"The opinions - written in 1973 when President Richard M. Nixon faced the Watergate investigation and then in 2000 following the Starr inquiry into ... Clinton's behavior - concluded that initiating criminal proceedings against a sitting president would interfere with the unique constitutional responsibilities of the nation's chief executive,\" Rosalind Helderman reports. \"Mueller cited the 2000 opinion on the first page of the volume of his report explaining his office's approach to assessing whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. ...</p><p>\"Mueller's view that department policy and issues of fairness prevented him from even assessing whether the president broke the law took some constitutional scholars and Justice Department veterans by surprise. ... Even senior Justice Department officials did not appear aware of Mueller's interpretation until he was finalizing his report.\"</p><p>             2. Mueller's statement highlighted key differences he has with Bill Barr over the facts and the law.          </p><p>Mueller said he would have said so if he had confidence the president clearly did not commit a crime. But the attorney general announced in March that he had determined Trump didn't commit the crime of obstruction of justice based on his review of the special counsel's report.</p><p>\"On Wednesday, Mueller said there was 'insufficient evidence' to show a conspiracy among Trump associates or Americans to aid Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. When Barr announced Mueller's findings, he said there was 'no evidence' to show any such conspiracy,\" Barrett notes. \"Asked about his disagreements with Mueller, Barr has made a point of emphasizing that when the two men met privately on March 5 to discuss the findings, Mueller said he would not claim the president would have been charged with a crime if he weren't the president. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Mueller's comments Wednesday 'a direct rebuke' of the attorney general's statements. ... Spokesmen for Mueller and Barr said Wednesday evening that the two men's statements about the OLC memo are not in conflict.\"</p><p>\"Trump has repeatedly praised Barr to White House aides and friends - saying he has defended him and proved to be a 'real' attorney general,\" per Josh Dawsey. \"Trump gave positive reviews to Barr's congressional testimony, his news conference before the report and his public comments, White House officials said.

Mueller really wants Americans to read both volumes of his 448-page report.          </p><p>The obstruction evidence in Volume II has received the lion's share of coverage, but the special counsel emphasized Russia's interference in the 2016 election, which he outlines in Volume I. \"That allegation deserves the attention of every American,\" Mueller said.</p><p>\"Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system,\" he added. \"They used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks. The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.\"</p><p>This comment is notable because Trump has so often downplayed the Kremlin's efforts. \"Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax,\" the president tweeted this morning. \"And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didn't exist.\"</p><p>\"If our country's political health were better, the Russian attack would get the attention of every American. But Mueller gives us more credit than we deserve,\" writes columnist Dana Milbank. \"His report assumed that our leaders would take seriously the Russian threat when presented with overwhelming evidence. Instead, Trump laughs about the whole thing with [Vladimir] Putin, Republican leaders quash bipartisan efforts to protect the 2020 election from another attack, and GOP lawmakers, instead of pondering the president's culpability and Mueller's damning findings, demand investigations of investigators' 'treason' and attempted 'coup.' In appealing to their better angels, Mueller was naive. Yet even Wednesday, as he entered the Justice Department briefing room, stooped and alone, he continued to act as though things were on the level. Russia is preparing to attack us - again. Trump is poised to benefit - again. Unlike in 2016, we now know Russia's bad intentions, thanks to Mueller.\"</p><p>             4.

That would give Trump an opportunity to claim vindication twice - by Mueller and by Congress. ... Pelosi bemoaned the news coverage, arguing that pro-impeachment Democrats received far more attention than some 200 members of the House Democratic Caucus who do not support such a step. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) - who has stopped short of advocating for impeachment in public but has privately pushed Pelosi to allow an inquiry to begin - said Congress must act.\"</p><p>\"Nothing is off the table, but we do want to make such a compelling case, such an ironclad case,\" that even the Republican Senate \"will be convinced of the path that we have to take as a country,\" Pelosi said in California. \"Many constituents want to impeach the president.

Most of them were from Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala-countries known collectively as the Northern Triangle, where rising gang violence and poverty has forced people to flee en masse.\"</p><p>             THE REST OF THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:          </p><p>             -- Trump is preparing an executive order aimed at increasing transparency around drug pricing, triggering pushback from the private industry.Amy Goldstein and Josh Dawsey report: \"The most far-reaching element favored by the White House aides developing the order would require insurers and hospitals to disclose for the first time the discounted rates they negotiate for services, according to health-care lobbyists and policy experts familiar with the deliberations. The idea has stirred such intense industry opposition, however, that it may be dropped from the final version.\u00a0... Other parts of the order are expected to make it easier for people on Medicare, the federal insurance program for older and disabled Americans, to find out what they would pay for treatment at various hospitals by widening the range of services for which hospitals must post their prices.\"</p><p>             -- The Trump administration scrapped a proposal to require federal job applicants to disclose whether they participated in a diversion program to avoid prison.Lisa Rein scoops: \"The proposed expanded criminal background checks appeared to conflict with [Trump's] support for criminal justice reform, an effort championed by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that has become an early issue in the 2020 presidential race. ... The change would have required applicants who receive a conditional job offer to note on a form any participation in a diversion program. The answer could lead a hiring manager to rescind the offer.\"</p><p>             -- The District's Office of Human Rights released a report showing D.C. employers have had to pay nearly $500,000 in settlements since a \"ban the box\" law went into effect in 2014. The law made it illegal to ask job applicants about their criminal history, but the office said the city has received nearly 2,000 complaints since the law's implementation about employers continuing to ask such questions.

Moyer)</p><p>             -- The new freedom fries: \"The Energy Department announced the approval of a liquefied natural gas project in Texas, saying it would allow 'molecules of U.S. freedom to be exported to the world,'\"Steven Mufson reports. \"The department said the permit for the expansion of the Freeport, Texas facility 'is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world.' It wasn't the first time the Trump administration and others have linked U.S. exports of natural gas to political freedom in other parts of the world, especially places like Lithuania and Poland, which both rely on natural gas purchased from Russia. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2018, Energy Secretary Rick Perry used the phrase, 'exporting freedom,' to describe growing gas exports.\"</p><p>             2020 WATCH:          </p><p>             -- Bernie Sanders is struggling to attract new supporters (and keep some of his old ones) in a crowded Democratic field.Sean Sullivan reports: \"Sanders consistently polls second to former vice president Joe Biden, but often in the teens, a precarious spot for someone who is known by virtually all Democratic voters. One of his trademark proposals - Medicare-for-all - has attracted fewer co-sponsors in Congress than two years ago. And although Sanders continues to draw larger crowds than most candidates, they are generally less diverse than the Democratic Party, highlighting one of his key weaknesses. ... His message of left-wing change has clear limits, as reflected in Biden's rise. And for those who do embrace his revolutionary cause, a messenger such as [Elizabeth] Warren, who has been rising in polls, may be fresher and more appealing.\"</p><p>             -- Beto O'Rourke released an immigration plan aimed at reversing many of Trump's initiatives and increasing refugee admissions.Jenna Johnson reports: \"O'Rourke's plan focuses on three broad objectives: Use executive authority to quickly reverse many of Trump's policies; halt construction of a wall along the southern border; overhaul the asylum system to more quickly process claims and protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation. It would push Congress to enact sweeping immigration changes that include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States and a new visa category that would allow communities and religious congregations to sponsor refugees; invest $5 billion in the Northern Triangle region of Central America, which comprises Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\"</p><p>             -- Biden's personal loss -\u00a0the death of his son\u00a0Beau\u00a0to cancer -\u00a0has emerged as a touchstone as he campaigns.NBC News's Mike Memoli reports: \"'I was diagnosed with cancer in August of 2017,' one man shared with Biden at a recent house party in New Hampshire. 'My son died also,' another woman told Biden as he worked his way through a tent in the cold rain. 'He couldn't get treatment.' 'My daughter has cancer too,' offered another. ... Now that shared grief is providing an unspoken bond between Biden and some of the voters he encounters. 'I wish I could tell you the names of the people coming up to me,' Biden told NBC News after several such interactions at that Nashua house party. Now, those moments are helping to shape his campaign. 'You know there's a lot of people who we can help, for real,' he said. 'There's no reason why we can't do so much more.'\"</p><p>             -- Roy Moore, the former Alabama judge who blew a special Senate election to Democrat\u00a0Doug Jones, hit back at Trump after the president publicly warned him not to run again.Politico's James Arkin reports: \"'The president doesn't control who votes for the United States Senate in Alabama,' Moore said in a phone interview. 'People in Alabama are smarter than that. They elect the senator from Alabama, not from Washington, D.C.' ... Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he has 'NOTHING' against Moore, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against the former judge. But, he wrote, Moore 'cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating.' That came after Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also tweeted at Moore to steer clear of the race.\"</p><p>             -- Former South Carolina Democratic Party\u00a0chairman\u00a0Jaime Harrison announced he would challenge Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) next year. The former aide to House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) hopes to become the first Democrat to win one of South Carolina's Senate seats since 1998. In his campaign kickoff video, Harrison highlighted his own biography and Graham's past contradictory comments about Trump. One highlighted clip from the 2016 GOP nomination fight shows Graham calling Trump \"a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot.\" Subsequent clips show the senator saying of the president, \"No, I don't think he's a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot,\" and that Trump \"deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and then some.\" (John Wagner)</p><p>             SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:          </p><p>Several 2020 Democrats called for impeachment proceedings to begin against Trump:</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump's allies rallied to his defense.

It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that U.S. policy changed in a fundamental fashion. The same threat of hostile European powers colonizing fragile states in Latin America that provoked the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 emerged again during World War II in concern about Nazi Germany making inroads. But instead of the gunboat diplomacy that characterized U.S. policy from the 1890s through 1914, President Franklin Roosevelt orchestrated hemispheric solidarity. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy succeeded where imperialism had failed the United States: building the Western Hemisphere into a U.S. bastion.\"</p><p>             -- The Atlantic, \"There Are Two Types of Airport People,\" by Amanda Mull: \"Because I'm a compulsively early person, I've always assumed the other people trucking through the airport were doing their best to be on time, even if their best was different from my own (superior) best. Why would anyone look at an experience as expensive and anxiety-inducing as flying and want to make it a little bit riskier? Some chronically late people do, of course, intend to be on time. But a smaller group of frequent fliers heads into air travel with lateness as the goal, relishing the thrill of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. 'I just really live for the feeling of literally running through the airport barefoot because you didn't have time to put your shoes on after security, and your laptop is in your hand because you didn't have time to put it back,' says my colleague Ellen Cushing, a senior editor at The Atlantic.\"</p><p>             -- Michael Wolff's \"Siege,\" the sequel to his bestseller \"Fire and Fury,\" features a trip inside Trumpworld guided by Steve Bannon,writes Ryan Lizza in a review for The Post: \"So the new Wolff book is much like the last one: a sail through the Trump diaspora and inside the president's head with Bannon as the cruise director. But also like the last book, 'Siege' is ultimately crippled by three flaws: Wolff's overreliance on a single character, and one who is now more distant from the action; factual errors that mar the author's credibility; and sourcing that is so opaque it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable. ... In 'Siege,' the dead arrive at Bannon's doorstep in the form of former Trump aides such as Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie, Sam Nunberg and Jason Miller, and Wolff, like many other Washington reporters, absorbs a mix of gossip, misinformation and occasional insight that the outer rings of Trump advisers are famous for circulating.\"</p><p>             DAYBOOK:          </p><p>             Trump\u00a0will travel to Colorado Springs to speak at the\u00a0United States Air Force Academy's graduation ceremony.</p><p>             NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:          </p><p>             -- A few scattered storms will likely break the heat.The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \"Storms could approach severe levels today but at least manage to push the real heat and humidity out of the area tomorrow.

Separately, an appellate court in New York upheld a lower court's decision that it is unconstitutional for Trump to block critics on Twitter because he's a public official who uses the platform to communicate with constituents.</p><p>But the balance of power is changing on the courts each week to become more favorable to Trump, and it sure sounded like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit might be ready to uphold at least parts of a federal district judge's decision in Texas that the entire 2010 health-care law is unconstitutional because the 2017 GOP tax bill got rid of the individual mandate to buy insurance. Two of the three judges on the panel expressed skepticism during the oral arguments that Obamacare can remain intact since the mandate was how Chief Justice John Roberts justified upholding the law in 2012.</p><p>Judge Kurt Engelhardt, whom Trump put on the bench just last year, was the more outspoken of the two. He repeatedly noted that the law was written without an explicit feature guaranteeing that if one part were ever removed by Congress or the courts, the rest would remain in place. He suggested that it's the job of Congress to forge a solution. He questioned whether the courts should be \"taxidermist for every legislative big-game accomplishment that Congress achieves.\" The judge who seemed to largely agree with him was appointed by George W. Bush. A third judge, appointed by Jimmy Carter, stayed silent during the 90-minute hearing, per Amy Goldstein, who was in the courtroom for us.</p><p>Engelhardt was grilling attorneys representing Democratic attorneys general and the Democratic House. Normally it would have been Justice Department lawyers defending a federal law, but the Trump administration is refusing to do so and told the 5th Circuit this spring that the administration agrees with the plaintiffs that it should be struck down.</p><p>If Trump gets what he's hoping for in New Orleans, there's a strong argument to be made that the president will be like the proverbial dog that catches up with the truck. Health care - the issue that dogged Republican candidates in the 2018 midterms more than any other - would almost certainly take a starring role in the 2020 campaign. The Supreme Court would probably then hear an appeal, in which Roberts would probably again cast a deciding vote - one way or another - in June of an election year.</p><p>             -- Here are three telling illustrations of how the 5th Circuit could hand Trump a Pyrrhic victory:          </p><p>             1) Despite a decade of efforts to kill Obamacare, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to say yesterday whether he supports the suit to invalidate the law. \"I think the important thing for the public to know is there is nobody in the Senate not in favor of covering preexisting conditions,\" he said at his weekly news conference. \"And if it were, under any of these scenarios, to go away, we would act quickly on a bipartisan basis to restore it.\"</p><p>Trump has had a historically large number of judicial vacancies to fill during his first two-and-a-half years largely because McConnell blocked consideration of so many of Barack Obama's nominees once he seized control of the Senate in 2015. It was not just Merrick Garland.</p><p>             2) Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who cast a key vote for the tax bill that could be used as a pretext by judicial activists to repeal Obamacare, is trying to distance herself from the lawsuit challenging the ACA. She also voted to confirm Engelhardt to the 5th Circuit, in addition to Justice Brett Kavanaugh. These votes could imperil her reelection next year. She issued a statement saying she opposes Trump's decision not to defend the health-care law in court. \"The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, and it is the Department of Justice's duty to defend it,\" Collins said.</p><p>             3) \"Democrats are savoring the moment,\"Paige Winfield Cunningham reports in the Health 202. \"They're spending the week bludgeoning Republicans over the high-stakes lawsuit, which they well know is prime fodder for 2020 attacks. The House Oversight Committee will hold a hearing this morning dubbed 'The Trump Administration's Attack on the ACA: Reversal in Court Case Threatens Health Care for Millions of Americans,' where a number of patients and consumers advocates will testify. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Attorneys General Association and the Democrat-affiliated group Protect Our Care launched hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of print and digital ads around the country. Democrats in Congress delivered floor speeches castigating their GOP colleagues. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said he's also planning a hearing on the lawsuit.\"</p><p>             -- As the judges in Louisiana considered the fate of health care for millions of people, the Senate voted 53 to 45 on party lines to confirm another controversial Trump nominee to the 9th Circuit, the court of appeals that has most often drawn the president's ire.Hailey Fuchs notes that Daniel Bress's confirmation gives Trump his seventh judge on the historically liberal bench, which now has 16 judges nominated by Democratic presidents and 12 by Republicans. The court still has one vacancy that Trump plans to fill. Bress, who once clerked for the late Antonin Scalia, was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Alex Kozinski, whom Kavanaugh once clerked for and who resigned in December 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>-- British Ambassador Kim Darroch resigned from his post this morning after three days of public attacks from Trump, who was angry about leaked cables that showed the diplomat privately described the president as \"inept\" and \"insecure.\"Jennifer Hassan reports: \"Trump blasted Darroch in a series of tweets this week, calling him 'a pompous fool' and said his administration would not work with him.\" In his resignation letter, Darroch said the \"current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like. Although my posting is not due to end until the end of this year, I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador.\"</p><p>             -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has two messages for Congress this morning: Central bank independence is critical, and an interest-rate cut is likely at the end of July.Heather Long got a first look at his prepared testimony before the House Financial Services Committee: \"Since [June], it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted,\" Powell will say. The U.S. economy is doing \"reasonably well,\" Powell will add, but he notes that business investment has \"slowed notably,\" probably because of the uncertainty around trade and global growth. He will also stress that the economic gains have not been shared evenly by everyone. Hispanics, African Americans and people in rural communities are continuing to have a harder time finding jobs that pay well.</p><p>             -- Reader feedback: Many of you, on the left and right, emailed in response to yesterday's Big Idea to say that manufacturers should keep raising wages for workers if they want to make their industry more appealing to young people and close the skills gap. Readers wrote that higher salaries would have a bigger impact than any marketing campaign from a trade association in making the sector more appealing.</p><p>             -- Support for legal abortion has hit a 24-year high as more states pass severe restrictions on the procedure, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.Emily Guskin and Scott Clement report: \"The Post-ABC poll finds a 60 percent majority who say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 55 percent in a 2013 Post-ABC poll, and tying the record high level of support from 1995. The latest survey finds 36 percent say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, also tying a record low. A 41 percent plurality of Americans want their own state to avoid making it either harder or easier for women to have access to abortion. Fewer, 32 percent, say their states should make it easier and fewer still, 24 percent say their states should make it harder for women to have access to abortion. ... Even within party ranks, allowing or banning abortion in all cases is a minority position. Among Democrats, 77 percent say abortion should be at least mostly legal, but just over 4 in 10 (42 percent) say it should be legal in all cases. Among Republicans, 52 percent say it should be at least mostly illegal, but fewer than a quarter, 22 percent, want it to be illegal in all cases.\"</p><p>             -- North Carolina state Rep. Greg Murphy won the Republican primary for the state's reliably red 3rd Congressional District, besting pediatrician Joan Perry by 20 points\u00a0in a special election.Felicia Sonmez reports: \"The race had been viewed by some as a test of women's standing within the Republican Party. Perry had won the endorsements of all 13 House Republican women and received nearly $1 million in support from an outside group created to boost female Republican House candidates. But in the end, she was outflanked by Murphy, who was backed by several House Republican heavyweights, including Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.).\"</p><p>             -- Cashing in:\u00a0Joe Biden, who continues\u00a0calling himself \"Middle Class Joe\" on the campaign trail, earned $15.6 million over the past two years.Matt Viser and Anu Narayanswamy: \"The vast majority of the former vice president's income - which totaled $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018 - came from book payments and speaking fees, according to newly released tax returns and financial disclosure forms required of federal office-seekers. All told, the Bidens made nearly five times more in the past two years than the next- highest earner, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who with her husband earned $3.3 million. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) each took in about $1.7 million in family income. ... Since leaving office, he has benefited from an explosion of wealth. He gave 47 speeches, according to the new filings, with fees as high as $234,000. His speaking fees and book payments amounted to $10 million in 2017 and $3.2 million in 2018. Biden was also a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was paid $371,159 in 2017 and $405,368 in 2018.\"</p><p>             -- On the strength of its pitchers, the American League will get home-field advantage in the World Series after a 4-3 win in the All-Star Game.\u00a0Dave Sheinen reports from Cleveland:\u00a0\"Perhaps someone sneaked into the bowels of Progressive Field on Tuesday and replaced the regular, turbocharged 2019 baseballs with century-old versions from the Dead Ball Era. How else to explain - in the midst of the biggest home run binge in the history of the sport, one year after the most homers ever hit in an All-Star Game and one night after the most electrifying performance in the history of the Home Run Derby - the relatively pedestrian showing in this year's Midsummer Classic? There is one other possible explanation, of course, and it is the one, conspiracy theories aside, that will have to suffice: There are great pitchers scattered across this game (shellshocked as they may be by the nightly home run binges), and on Tuesday night they shone brightest. ...\u00a0The victory was the seventh in a row by the AL, its 14th in the past 17 and 19th in the past 23 All-Star Games.\"</p><p>             -- MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred denied yesterday\u00a0that the league has knowingly \"juiced\" baseballs to increase the number of home runs this season, despite mounting complaints from pitchers. Manfred attributed the spike in homers to naturally occurring variances in manufacturing baseballs and vowed transparency as officials move to correct the problem, per\u00a0Sheinin.</p><p>             GET SMART FAST:  </p><p>             THE #METOO RECKONING:          </p><p>             -- Trump is standing by his embattled labor secretary, saying he feels \"very badly\" for Alex Acosta, as Democratic calls mounted for Acosta's resignation over the generous plea deal he struck with financier Jeffrey Epstein when he was a federal prosecutor. Trump said the White House will look closely at the circumstances surrounding the sex-charges deal negotiated by Acosta. \"I feel very badly, actually, for Secretary Acosta because I've known him as being somebody who works so hard and has done such a good job,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office.</p><p>             -- Acosta broke his silence and defended himself on Twitter: \"The crimes committed by Epstein are horrific, and I am pleased that NY prosecutors are moving forward with a case based on new evidence,\" he wrote, suggesting that prosecutors have new evidence he did not when he was Miami's U.S. attorney.</p><p>             -- Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi called on Acosta to step down, as did most of the 2020 Democratic candidates. \"Congressional Republicans supported Acosta, saying issues about the plea deal were vetted at his confirmation hearing in 2017. Acosta's critics said he was not fit to lead an agency that has oversight over human trafficking offenses,\" John Wagner and Lisa Rein report. \"Some attorneys for victims questioned Acosta's tweet saying the evidence was new.\"</p><p>             -- Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is privately urging Trump to dump Acosta,Politico's Eliana Johnson and Burgess Everett report: \"Acosta critics, including Mulvaney, have argued that he has not been aggressive enough in stamping out Obama-era workplace regulations and employment discrimination lawsuits, and they are using the Epstein lawsuit to push him out the door. Mulvaney on Tuesday acknowledged the tension with Acosta but said it was merely part of the job. 'I push all of the Cabinet Secretaries on the deregulatory agenda, as it is a top priority of the President,' Mulvaney said in a statement. ... One move that has particularly rankled conservatives is Acosta's decision to allow an employment discrimination lawsuit to proceed against Oracle, the rare Silicon Valley company that is not entirely hostile to the GOP.\"</p><p>             -- The Justice Department said Attorney General William Barr will not recuse himself from the current prosecution of Epstein, but he will not engage in \"any retrospective review\" of the 2008 plea deal.Matt Zapotosky reports: \"Barr had telegraphed at his confirmation hearing in January that he might have to step aside from any Justice Department reviews of Epstein's case, because another lawyer at his then-firm, Kirkland &amp; Ellis, had represented the wealthy financier. The other lawyer, Jay P. Lefkowitz, helped secure [the previous deal]. The split nature of Barr's recusal suggests that federal prosecutors in New York - who unsealed new sex trafficking charges against Epstein on Monday - might not be investigating authorities' handling of the previous allegations. The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility has been reviewing the handling of Epstein's 2008 plea deal for possible misconduct, and Barr is recused from that.\"</p><p>             -- The Miami Herald has reported that Lefkowitz, Barr's colleague at the time, had a one-on-one meeting with Acosta at which the then-U.S. attorney agreed not to prosecute Epstein in federal court.          </p><p>             -- Epstein amassed a network of powerful connections as authorities say that he was simultaneously abusing dozens of young girls.Marc Fisher reports: \"Even as dozens of women were looking to police, prosecutors and courts to hold Epstein to account for his alleged sexual abuses, he was amassing a stunning list of contacts and, in some cases, defenders across the worlds of Hollywood moviemaking, medical research, diplomacy, finance, politics and law. ... He donated large sums toward neuroscience research at Harvard and a California lab. He invited researchers to his New York house and talked math with them over equations scrawled on a blackboard in his dining room. He flew former president Bill Clinton and actor Kevin Spacey to Africa to promote AIDS awareness. He was a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.\"</p><p>             -- The criminal case against Epstein had gone cold, but Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown kept pursuing the story and forced authorities to pay attention.The Times's Tiffany Hsu reports: \"Months ago, she published a meticulously researched series of\u00a0articles\u00a0about the secret plea deal. ... Her work identified some 80 alleged victims ... She worked on the award-winning series with Emily Michot, a visual journalist at The Herald. While Mr. Epstein moved about freely, reportedly building\u00a0a new compound\u00a0in the Virgin Islands, Ms. Brown continued to dig, accumulating enough documentation to fill a spare bedroom in her Florida home. ... Geoffrey Berman, a federal prosecutor, said at a news conference that his team had been 'assisted by some excellent investigative journalism.'\"</p><p>             -- Trump once threw a party with \"28 girls\" at Mar-a-Lago. He and Epstein were the only men there.The Times's Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman dig into the relationship:\u00a0\"The year was 1992 and the event was a 'calendar girl' competition, something that George Houraney, a Florida-based businessman who ran American Dream Enterprise, had organized at Mr. Trump's request. 'I arranged to have some contestants fly in,' Mr. Houraney recalled in an interview on Monday. 'At the very first party, I said, 'Who's coming tonight? I have 28 girls coming.' It was him and Epstein.' Mr. Houraney, who had just partnered with Mr. Trump to host events at his casinos, said he was surprised. 'I said, 'Donald, this is supposed to be a party with V.I.P.s. You're telling me it's you and Epstein?'' In fact, that was the case, an indication of a yearslong friendship between the president and Mr. Epstein that some say ended only after a failed business arrangement between them. ...</p><p>             \"The full nature of their eventual falling out is not clear. ... The relationship with Mr. Trump turned so toxic that Mr. Epstein at one point told friends that he blamed Mr. Trump for his legal problems with the Palm Beach County police. But while Mr. Trump has dismissed the relationship, Mr. Epstein, since the election, has played it up, claiming to people that he was the one who introduced Mr. Trump to his third wife, Melania Trump, though neither of the Trumps has ever mentioned Mr. Epstein playing a role in their meeting.\"</p><p>             SELECTIVE AMNESIA:          </p><p>             -- Trump has a pattern of quickly minimizing ties with people who criticize him or who find themselves facing an onslaught of negative attention that reflects poorly on him. Epstein and Darroch are only the two latest examples.Josh Dawsey reports: \"Trump sat across from Darroch during the annual St. Patrick's Day lunch on Capitol Hill in March, inquiring about Brexit and bragging of his strong political standing. ... Trump interacted with Darroch on a number of occasions in London and Washington. ... But after leaked cables showed Darroch criticizing Trump's administration as 'inept' and the president as 'insecure,' the president seemed to have a memory lapse. 'I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool,' Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter. ... Asked Tuesday about Epstein, Trump said that he was 'not a fan' of his. ... 'I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years,' Trump said. In a 2002 interview with New York Magazine before Epstein was in trouble, Trump sang a different tune. 'I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,' Trump said. ...</p><p>\"Among those who have gotten the 'I barely know the guy' treatment: Former acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, conservative commentator Ann Coulter, former lawyer Michael Cohen, fired FBI director James B. Comey, former senior White House aide Stephen K. Bannon, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former State Department official Brett McGurk, longtime adviser Roger Stone, former White House aide Cliff Sims, former campaign aide George Papadopoulos and even the rapper Lil Jon, who starred on Trump's reality TV show 'Celebrity Apprentice.' The people change, but the comments are eerily similar - and are something of a joke among some Trump advisers.\"</p><p>             -- He is the do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do president: Trump attacked the \"Radical Left\" last night for encouraging boycotts\u00a0against companies whose owners support him, even though he has repeatedly advocated the exact same tactic in the past against his perceived critics. Trump was rallying to the defense of Home Depot and its co-founder, Bernard Marcus, who have been at the center of a boycott from liberal customers after the billionaire said he plans to spend part of his fortune supporting Trump's 2020 campaign.</p><p>\"Among the companies he has targeted are Macy's, which once carried his clothing line but abandoned him after he called Mexicans 'rapists' in his campaign kickoff speech in 2015, and Apple, which he urged to release the cellphone information of the perpetrators of the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.,\"\u00a0Isaac Stanley-Becker recalls.\u00a0\"Last year, he celebrated plans to boycott Harley-Davidson when the motorcycle company said it would move some production overseas because of steel tariffs imposed by the president. He has also implored his Twitter followers to boycott Megyn Kelly's show on Fox News and suggested that dropping AT&amp;T could compel CNN to improve its coverage of him. ... The president has argued that Nike and the NFL would encounter 'anger and boycotts' as long as they support players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. He struck a different tone on Tuesday, saying it was unfair to penalize a company because one of its co-founders supported 'your favorite President, me!'\"</p><p>             THERE'S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:          </p><p>             -- A congressional panel grilled former Trump associate Felix Sater for more details on the president's failed Moscow project.Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger report: \"Sater met privately with House Intelligence Committee staffers investigating interference in the 2016 presidential election and questions surrounding Trump's business interests in Russia in 2016. At issue is Michael Cohen's false testimony before the same committee in 2017 and whether Trump was compromised by his organization's effort to build in Moscow. When pressed Tuesday to provide information about his knowledge of Cohen's testimony, Sater at one point cited lawyer-client privilege and declined to respond, according to accounts of the exchange described by Sater's attorney and a spokesman for the committee.\"</p><p>             -- Federal prosecutors no longer want Michael Flynn to testify against his former partner because they doubt his version of events, according to a court filing.Rachel Weiner reports: \"The move could have implications for Flynn in D.C. federal court, where he is awaiting sentencing in a case brought by the special counsel. ... Flynn had been expected to be a key witness in the Virginia trial of Bijan Rafiekian, with whom he ran a consulting business. A court filing from Rafiekian's attorneys includes an email that Assistant U.S. Attorney James P. Gillis ended by saying prosecutors 'do not necessarily agree' with Flynn's 'characterizations' of how he came to make an inaccurate filing under the Foreign Agent Registration Act for an influence campaign that benefited the Turkish government.\u00a0According to the email, Flynn says he did not provide false information to his attorneys at the time, did not read the FARA filing before signing it and was not aware that it contained falsehoods. In their filing, Rafiekian's lawyers say they 'interpreted the email's final sentence as a euphemism for, 'we've concluded [Flynn] is lying.'</p><p>\"The decision by prosecutors could imperil Flynn's ability to avoid incarceration for lying to the FBI unless he is pardoned by Trump.\u00a0Flynn's defense attorney, Sidney Powell, said in a statement that 'General Flynn is still cooperating with the government even if they don't call him as a witness.'\"</p><p>             -- The Justice Department directed two former members of Mueller's team, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles, not to testify before Congress.The Times's Nicholas Fandos and Katie Benner report: \"It is unclear what effect the Justice Department's intervention will have on the men's eventual appearances, but it raises the prospect that a deal lawmakers thought they had struck last month for testimony from Mr. Mueller, the former special counsel, and the two prosecutors could still unravel. Both Mr. Zebley and Mr. Quarles have left the Justice Department and are now private citizens, meaning that the department most likely cannot actually block their testimony. But the department's view - depending on how strongly it is expressed - could have a chilling effect on two longtime employees and give them cover to avoid testifying.\"</p><p>             -- The House Judiciary Committee will vote tomorrow on whether to subpoena 12 individuals with connections to Trump, including Jared Kushner and Jeff Sessions, for their investigation on whether the president obstructed justice.Colby Itkowitz reports: \"The panel will also vote to subpoena documents related to the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy on migrants entering the country illegally, which led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents in 2018. ...

More than a dozen members of Congress readily admitted ... that they too have skipped around rather than studying every one of the special counsel report's 448 pages. And despite the report technically ranking as a best-seller, only a tiny fraction of the American public has actually cracked the cover and really dived in. 'What's the point?' said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). ... The result, say lawmakers, historians and cultural critics, is a giant literacy gap in the country when it comes to the most authoritative examination into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump obstructed that investigation.\"</p><p>             -- Pelosi said she will not address \"anything more that [Barr] has to say\" because he \"has lied to Congress.\" Pelosi's comments came a day after the attorney general accused Democrats of trying \"to create some kind of public spectacle\" by calling for Mueller to publicly testify next week. \"I don't even want to address him,\" Pelosi said in response. \"He has lied to Congress as the attorney general of the United States. He's lied under oath. I'm not speaking to anything more that he has to say.\" (John Wagner)</p><p>             -- Russian intelligence agents appear to have been the first people to promote the conspiracy theory that DNC staffer Seth Rich was killed by assassins working for Hillary Clinton.Yahoo News's Michael Isikoff reports: \"Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, first circulated a phony 'bulletin' - disguised to read as a real intelligence report -about the alleged murder of the former DNC staffer on July 13, 2016, according to the U.S. federal prosecutor who was in charge of the Rich case. That was just three days after Rich, 27, was killed in what police believed was a botched robbery while walking home to his group house in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C., about 30 blocks north of the Capitol. ... In a graphic example of how fake news infects the internet, those precise details popped up the same day on an obscure website, whatdoesitmean.com, that is a frequent vehicle for Russian propaganda. The website's article, which attributed its claims to 'Russian intelligence,' was the first known instance of Rich's murder being publicly linked to a political conspiracy.\"</p><p>             -- Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier, was interviewed for 16 hours last month as part of the investigation by Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's inspector general.Politico's Natasha Bertrand reports: \"The extensive, two-day interview took place in London while Trump was in Britain for a state visit, [two] sources said, and delved into Steele's extensive work on Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence-collection methods and his findings about Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who the FBI ultimately surveilled. ... The interview was contentious at first, the sources added, but investigators ultimately found Steele's testimony credible and even surprising. The takeaway has irked some U.S. officials interviewed as part of the probe - they argue that it shouldn't have taken a foreign national to convince the inspector general that the FBI acted properly in 2016.\"</p><p>             THE IMMIGRATION WARS:          </p><p>             -- Border arrests are dropping as Mexico's crackdown on migrants takes effect.Nick Miroff reports: \"The number of people taken into custody along the U.S. southern border fell 28 percent in June, a drop that U.S. authorities say reflects the early impact of Mexico's crackdown on Central American migration.

When host Tucker Carlson asked Thiel whether he has any evidence to support his accusation that Google is working in cahoots with the Chinese government, the PayPal co-founder responded that he was just \"asking questions.\" Moments after \"Fox &amp; Friends\" aired a clip from that sit-down the next morning, President Trump - who has routinely criticized the company - called Thiel \"a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone!\" He tweeted: \"The Trump Administration will take a look!\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The Department of Justice announced last night that it is opening an antitrust review of \"market-leading online platforms\" to take a look at \"widespread concerns ... about search, social media, and some retail services.\" Prosecutors said they will \"seek redress\" if their investigation finds that these companies violated any federal competition laws. \"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" Makan Delrahim, the DOJ's assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement.</p><p>\"It did not mention any major tech giant by name, but its stated interests track closely with Google's dominance in search, Facebook's leadership in social media and Amazon's position as the country's e-commerce leader,\" Tony Romm, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg report. \"To start, DOJ officials are planning a meeting this week with attorneys general from states such as Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa to examine the potential for bringing state-level cases against tech giants.\"</p><p>\"Another way to read this is that the administration doesn't like any of these tech firms because they think they all lean Democratic and stifle conservative voices, and this is just pure, raw-knuckles payback,\" said Bob Litan, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ antitrust division who helped prosecute Microsoft.</p><p>             Investigations at the DOJ are supposed to be independent of political influence from the White House, and Justice Department officials have been adamant that these inquiries are not politically motivated. But the president has not inspired confidence in this regard by reportedly trying to interfere in past competition-related matters, including AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner Cable, a deal that included CNN, a frequent target of Trump's attacks. Trump appointees at the Justice Department used a novel antitrust theory to try thwarting that merger, but the government lost in both lower court and on appeal.</p><p>             The appearance alone that the federal government's law enforcement apparatus is being marshaled against America's most successful innovators because Trump doesn't like them threatens to further erode public confidence that Lady Justice is truly blindfolded. It feels like the plot of a dystopian Ayn Rand novel, with Mark Zuckerberg or Sergey Brin as Hank Rearden. But who is John Galt?</p><p>The New Yorker reported in March that Trump pressured Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, to tell the Justice Department to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal a few months before DOJ filed that suit. According to the magazine, Trump called Cohn and then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly into his office and said, \"I've been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing's happened! I've mentioned it fifty times. And nothing's happened. I want to make sure it's filed. I want that deal blocked.\" Cohn reportedly told Kelly after they left the Oval Office not to follow through with the president's request. As a point of contrast, the Justice Department did not try to stop Trump ally Rupert Murdoch when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox. \"Under Trump, the government has consistently furthered Murdoch's business interests, to the detriment of his rivals,\" Jane Mayer wrote in her piece.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Trump has repeatedly sought to link the online store and this newspaper, whose coverage he has criticized, even though they are separate entities that operate independently. Last year, Trump personally pushed the U.S. postmaster general to double the rate that the Postal Service charges Amazon to ship packages, which could cost the company billions. The postmaster general pushed back by showing the president how profitable the partnership is for the government.</p><p>             -- Trump is not just maneuvering behind the scenes to undermine his perceived enemies in tech. There are many examples of the president invoking partisan politics as he explicitly advocates, in sometimes chilling terms, for the heavy hand of the state to be used against private industry.          </p><p>At the White House social media summit the week before last, for example, Trump ominously threatened to do battle with technology firms who he says treat conservatives unfairly. \"They're not using what we gave them fairly, and they have to do that,\" Trump told a crowd of his supporters. \"We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest. To me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write something bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech.\"</p><p>On June 26, Trump phoned into Fox Business and attacked Google and Twitter for being \"totally biased\" against him. \"Let me tell you, they're trying to rig the election,\" he alleged. \"That's what we should be looking at, not the phony witch hunt.\" He added that the companies seek to foment \"hatred for the Republicans.\"</p><p>On June 10, Trump telephoned into CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" and said that there is \"something going on in terms of monopoly\" vis-a-vis Facebook, Google and Amazon. \"I can tell you they discriminate against me,\" the president said. \"People talk about collusion. The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies. They were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, 'If you don't have them, you can't win.' Well, I won. And I'll win again.\"</p><p>             -- Prominent Democrats have expressed broad-based support for DOJ's antitrust probe into the major technology companies, which they believe have accumulated too much power. But some prominent lawmakers, including Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), emphasized last night that any investigation by the Justice Department must be entirely free of political interference. A House Judiciary subcommittee is already conducting its own bipartisan investigation of the companies. Elizabeth Warren has made breaking up the big tech companies a central plank of her platform.</p><p>             -- The tech companies face a multi-front assault from the feds: Attorney General Bill Barr attacked encrypted messaging programs, singling out Facebook-owned WhatsApp, during a blistering speech yesterday at the International Conference on Cyber Security in New York. The attorney general said that one Mexican cartel \"started using WhatsApp as their primary communication method, preventing U.S. law enforcement from conducting wiretaps that would enable us to locate fentanyl shipments and seize them at the border.\" That same cartel, he said, created a WhatsApp group chat \"for the specific purpose of coordinating the murders of Mexico-based police officials. The cartel ended up murdering hundreds of these police officers. Had we been able to gain access to the chat group on a timely basis, we could have saved these lives.\"</p><p>\"It marks a forceful return by the Justice Department to the encryption debate it has shied away from in recent years, after a bruising fight between the FBI and Apple over the locked phone of a dead terrorism suspect,\" Devlin Barrett reports. \"Last year, the FBI acknowledged that while they had repeatedly claimed investigators were locked out of nearly 7,800 devices connected to crimes, the correct number was much smaller, between 1,000 and 2,000.\"</p><p>In response, a WhatsApp spokesman sent a statement from Facebook executive Gail Kent: \"Cybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it's impossible to create any backdoor that couldn't be discovered - and exploited - by bad actors. It's why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.\"</p><p>             -- To be sure, the tech companies don't have totally clean noses: The Federal Trade Commission alleges that Facebook misled billions of users about its handling of their data as part of a wide-ranging complaint that accompanies a $5 billion settlement announced this morning.          </p><p>\"The agency argued that the social-networking company was not upfront about the ways that app developers, advertisers and others gained access to users' personal data - from the content they 'liked' to the phone numbers they stored - in breach of Facebook's previous promise to improve its privacy protections online,\" Romm reports. \"As a result, the settlement between the FTC and Facebook includes the largest fine in U.S. history for a privacy violation, and it grants federal regulators unparalleled access to the social-networking giant's business decisions for the next two decades - allowing regulators to scrutinize the actions of Facebook's leaders, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, and its efforts to launch new products and services. Facebook, however, did not have to admit guilt for its misdeeds.\"</p><p>             -- You may notice some changes below: We're experimenting with several formatting adjustments to the Daily 202 this summer.

Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to resign today after two weeks of mass protests:\u00a0El Nuevo D\u00eda reports\u00a0that Wanda V\u00e1zquez, the justice secretary, will be Rossell\u00f3's successor. Sources told the local newspaper that Rossell\u00f3 has recorded a goodbye message that will be broadcast today. Another local paper, El Vocero, also says the governor will step down.\u00a0\"Since the disclosure almost two weeks ago of the text messages, the administration has lost its investment officer, press secretary and two fiscal agency heads -- one of whom lasted just five days. The governor's chief of staff quit Tuesday night,\"\u00a0Bloomberg News reports.\u00a0</p><p>             THERE'S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Today's the big day: Former special counsel Robert Mueller is testifying before\u00a0Congress this morning, and he's bringing his longtime aide with him.Rachael Bade and Matt Zapotosky report: \"Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee agreed to allow Aaron Zebley, a former top deputy to Mueller, to sit beside him and advise him in his answers. The accommodation came after Mueller asked that Zebley be allowed to testify as a witness next to him, a request Judiciary Democrats rejected. The House Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, has agreed to let Zebley be sworn in for its hearing later in the day, according to a committee aide. Zebley was Mueller's chief of staff when Mueller was FBI director, and he played largely the same role inside the special counsel's office. ... 'The special counsel's office has made it clear for some time, they'd like to have him present, they would like to allow him to answer questions,' said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). 'We want this hearing to be about Director Mueller.'\"</p><p>             Trump didn't react well to the news of Zebley's addition: \"Just got back only to hear of a last-minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow,\" he tweeted. \"What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR, SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!\" While many in Mueller's team gave political donations to Democratic candidates in the past, Zebley has no political donation history and there is no evidence\u00a0that he is a \"Never Trumper.\" Bade and Zapotosky reported last night that\u00a0\"one person familiar with the matter said that Mueller made the request to have Zebley be sworn in and testify in the last 24 hours or so. The Justice Department did not authorize Zebley to testify and objects to his doing so, said the individual.\u00a0Republicans decried the move as an 11th-hour trick, arguing Democrats would have had to announce another witness days ago under traditional procedures in the House.\"</p><p>             -- An adviser to Trump's transition team was convicted on foreign-agent charges.From Politico: \"A federal jury on Tuesday convicted Bijan Rafiekian, a former business partner of Michael Flynn, on a pair of foreign-agent felony charges stemming from work the two men did for Turkish interests during the final months of the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. ... Rafiekian, 67, faces up to 15 years in prison on the two felony counts against him: acting as an unregistered foreign agent in the U.S., and conspiracy to violate that law as well as to submit false statements to the Justice Department in a foreign-agent filing. ... The Iranian-American businessman, who was Flynn's main partner in his short-lived consulting firm, also served as an adviser to the Trump transition team on national security issues.\"</p><p>             -- Most Americans still believe Congress should not begin impeachment hearings against Trump.Here are four other takeaways from Emily Guskin on how Americans view Mueller and impeachment\u00a0going into the hearing:</p><p>             -- Ousted FBI director James Comey expressed hope that House Democrats would ask Mueller about Barr's misleading summary of the former special counsel's report and how the attorney general has \"slimed the FBI.\"\u00a0From Fox News: \"Comey insisted that he and everyone at the DOJ 'should have been fired' if they didn't pursue an investigation in Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and whether there was an 'American connection' in its efforts.\u00a0... 'This is a chance for the American people to learn what he found,' Comey told MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace. 'It's too bad that having published a 450-page report, that didn't get the job done, but it didn't. Folks don't know what he found. And you can ask him in a simple and straightforward way and get those details in front of the American people.'\"</p><p>             -- What critics, pundits and journalists are expecting from Mueller's hearing:          </p><p>             -- You can keep up with The Post's live coverage of Mueller's testimony\u00a0here.          </p><p>             -- The president, while complaining about the Mueller probe, falsely told a room full of teenagers at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit that\u00a0the Constitution gives him \"the right to do whatever I want.\"\u00a0Michael Brice-Saddler reports: \"Trump lamented the duration and cost of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, which he has repeatedly said found 'no collusion, no obstruction.' 'Then, I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president,'\u00a0he said. 'But I don't even talk about that.' ...\u00a0Article II grants the president 'executive power.' It does not indicate the president has total power. Article II is the same part of the Constitution that describes some of Congress's oversight responsibilities, including over the office of the presidency. It also details how the president may be removed from office via impeachment.\"</p><p>             -- House Democrats are preparing to formally endorse Trump-related subpoenas to strengthen their court case to access the president's personal financial information.From Politico: \"The proposal, filed Tuesday afternoon by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), would formally declare that any committee subpoenas related to Trump, his family, current and former White House officials and the Trump Organization are presumed to have the blessing of the full House of Representatives. The Rules Committee is expected to advance the measure Tuesday night, and the House is expected to pass it on Wednesday. ... The measure, recommended by House counsel Doug Letter, responds to a line of questioning by [former Trump administration official] Neomi Rao, a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, who is one of three judges weighing a Democratic subpoena to access records from Trump's personal accounting firm. During oral arguments earlier this month, Rao repeatedly wondered why the full House hadn't voted to authorize the probe of Trump's finances, which is being led by the House Oversight Committee.\"</p><p>             -- Democrats are growing more and more frustrated as House investigators struggle to hold Trump accountable.Rachael Bade reports: \"In more than seven months of investigating Trump, a half-dozen Democratic-led House committees have struggled to unearth major findings, hold high-profile hearings that move public sentiment or follow up on inquiries they laid out when the party took the majority in January. ... Investigators blame Trump's historic stonewalling for their difficulties. ... Two of the committee chairmen leading investigations - Judiciary's Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Ways and Means' Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) - have drawn primary challengers who dismiss glacial-paced oversight and demand the ultimate step: impeachment proceedings against Trump. ... The bitterness is expressed by party challengers and far-left groups, but it extends beyond the most liberal voices. A core group of aides to President Barack Obama who dealt with relentless GOP investigations of their former boss have questioned whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's aversion to impeachment has created what Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama, recently called a 'bizarre abdication' of congressional duties.\"</p><p>             -- House investigators blame Trump's stonewalling for their difficulties making any breaks. Case in point: Trump sued the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as New York's attorney general, to block disclosure of his tax returns.From CNBC: \"The president's lawsuit, which was filed 'in his capacity as a private citizen,' came less than a month after the [committee] sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to obtain Trump's federal returns. ... Trump's lawyers argue that the House panel 'lacks a legitimate legislative purpose' to use a recently passed New York state law to get Trump's returns. They also claim that state law violated the president's First Amendment rights, because it was enacted to 'discriminate and retaliate against President Trump for his speech and politics.'\"</p><p>             -- Trump is at odds with Senate Republicans over how to impose sanctions on\u00a0Turkey for purchasing a Russian antimissile system.Karoun Demirjian, Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report: \"Senate Republicans, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James E. Risch (Idaho), are urging Trump not to waive mandatory sanctions against Turkey for purchasing the Russian-made S-400 system, which they argue would jeopardize the security of NATO's F-35 stealth fighter technology. ... Trump appeared to be advocating negotiations with Turkey instead of harsh sanctions - leading to a 'robust discussion' and the open dispute between Risch and the president, according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting.\"</p><p>             -- A high-profile Chinese fugitive, billionaire and member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club is accused of being a Communist spy.From the Miami Herald: \"Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who also goes by Miles Kwok, fled to the United States four years ago after learning an associate had been arrested on corruption charges. He is now one of China's most-wanted, accused of myriad crimes by the Chinese government, including paying bribes and sexual assault. He maintains his innocence, saying the charges are politically motivated. Guo, who made his money in real estate, has long promoted himself as a dissident being hunted by the Chinese government for his opposition to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. He is currently seeking political asylum in the United States, where he reportedly avoided deportation by the Trump administration after the president learned Guo was a member of Mar-a-Lago.\"          </p><p>             THE IMMIGRATION WARS:          </p><p>             -- A record number of Americans, 27 percent, believe immigration is the top problem facing the country. Since\u00a0Gallup began regularly polling people's top worries in 1993, immigration has been cited by an average of 6 percent of Americans as their top concern.

'The first thing he said to me was, 'Mommy, they let me go. I'm free,'' she said by phone. Galicia's detention appears to have been a bureaucratic mix up related to the fact that he had a U.S. birth certificate and also, years earlier, a Mexican visitor's visa to travel to the U.S. from Mexico.\"</p><p>             -- Thousands of undocumented, unaccompanied migrant children are at risk of spending the rest of their childhoods in custody, according to the head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.From CBS News: \"The federal government is required to pursue 'prompt and continuous efforts toward family reunification' of unaccompanied migrant children, according to a landmark court settlement, but for thousands of kids in ORR care, that reunion may never happen. 'Unfortunately, I have well over 4,000 of those children in my care at this time at the Office of Refugee Resettlement,' the director, Jonathan Hayes, told CBS News in June. 'So conceivably someone could come into our care at 15 years old and not have an identifiable sponsor in the United States and remain with us for a few years.' On their 18th birthdays, many of the children will be taken from ORR's youth holding facilities, referred to as shelters, to adult detention centers operated by (ICE).\"</p><p>             -- Trump vowed to deport \"millions\" of immigrants. The final tally from the ICE raids that sowed fear in communities across the country: 18 family members detained and 17 \"collateral\" arrests.Maria Sacchetti reports: \"ICE announced the data Tuesday morning, tucking it into a news conference that included information about worksite enforcement and routine criminal arrests. Aside from the 35 immigrants apprehended in the much-anticipated family operation, immigration agents separately picked up nearly 900 adults - most of them convicted criminals - and delivered more than 3,000 notices to companies nationwide that authorities will audit their records to ensure that workers are in the United States legally. Acting ICE Director Matthew T. Albence called the criminal operation successful and said the family operation, Operation Border Resolve, will continue, although the number of arrests were lower than in the past. The first such operation, over New Year's weekend in 2016 under the Obama administration, led to the arrests of 121 adults and children in Georgia, Texas and North Carolina.\"</p><p>             -- While touting his Senate bid, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach talks often about the nonprofit group he advises aimed at\u00a0building a border wall with citizen donations. The organization, however, is tangled in problems at all levels of government.From the Wichita Eagle: \"In building the first segments of its promised barrier, the group has angered officials in a New Mexico border town and prompted a Florida agency to investigate consumer complaints lodged against it. What's more, the federal agency tasked with enforcing boundary and water treaties between the United States and Mexico has identified a number of problems with We Build The Wall. ... Kobach has said Trump blessed the effort, but the White House continues to decline to confirm that. As his Senate candidacy gears up, Kobach appears likely to remain an ambassador for We Build the Wall. His aides say there is no connection between the campaign and the group. But his continuing involvement creates the potential for blurred lines.\"</p><p>             THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA:          </p><p>             -- The House passed a resolution condemning efforts to boycott and economically isolate Israel over its policies toward Palestinians.Mike DeBonis reports: \"The 398-to-17 vote comes after months of turmoil centering on Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), two Muslim freshmen who have stood accused of anti-Semitism over public remarks they have made referencing Israel and the Holocaust. The congresswomen, repeatedly singled out by President Trump in the past week, opposed the resolution, arguing that it infringes on free speech and the right to participate in boycotts for human and civil rights. Trump renewed his attacks on Omar on Tuesday, calling her an 'America hating anti-Semite' in a tweet. ... 'You want to criticize the government? That's your right. You want to stop buying products from a certain country? That's also your right,' said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.). 'But participating in an international commercial effort that undermines Israel's legitimacy and scuttles the chances of a two-state solution isn't the same as an individual exercising First Amendment rights.'\"</p><p>             -- Omar's Republican challenger in Minneapolis, a special education teacher, appears to be a QAnon conspiracy theorist.

Wray said the bureau does not investigate any group merely for its beliefs.

He became a vocal political participant on Facebook, something he had not done previously. He was not discerning of the pro-Trump information he received, and by the time of his arrest, he was 'connected' to hundreds of right-wing Facebook groups. Many of these groups promoted various conspiracy theories and, more generally, the idea that Trump's critics were dangerous, unpatriotic, and evil ... They deployed provocative language to depict Democrats as murderous, terroristic, and violent ... Fox News furthered these arguments. For example, just days before Mr. Sayoc mailed his packages, Sean Hannity said on his program that a large 'number of Democratic leaders [were] encouraging mob violence against their political opponents.'\" (Erik Wemple)</p><p>             -- Dallas financier and political schmoozer Ed Butowsky was a central promoter of the Seth Rich conspiracy theory, urging Fox News to dedicate airtime to the inflammatory and unsubstantiated story that Rich leaked Democratic National Committee documents to WikiLeaks and was\u00a0killed\u00a0for doing so. Butowsky, who at the time was on friendly terms with former White House officials Steve Bannon and Sean Spicer, pursued and promoted his theory to Fox News and members of the Trump administration as he offered to foot the bill for a private investigator for\u00a0Rich's parents.

A group of activists had used Gorilla Glue to fasten their hands to the doorjambs of a tunnel connecting the Capitol to the House office buildings, according to a participant who declined to give his full name. About 15 other people were helping, he said. ... Members of the group said they are calling for a vote on legislation introduced by Democratic Reps.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democratic presidential contender, also condemned the actions. 'Completely unacceptable,' de Blasio tweeted on Monday about the Manhattan incident. 'The NYPD kept New Yorkers safe through the heat wave and last night's outages. We won't tolerate this kind of disrespect.'

So far, none of them are emphasizing the \"glass ceiling.\"From the Times: \"In politics, the phrase became associated with the aspirations of Hillary Clinton, who spoke at key moments of success and defeat about cracking the glass ceiling. But in this barrier-breaking field of female candidates, it is noticeably absent. ... Nobody has used the allegory quite like Mrs. Clinton, who has for years talked about the 'highest, hardest glass ceiling' she was determined to crack ... And then, of course, there was the fateful night at the Javits Center in Manhattan, under a literal glass ceiling where confetti shaped like glass shards was supposed to rain from above as Mrs. Clinton acknowledge victory ... 'I remember thinking that the symbolism was going to feel so satisfying,' said Emma Gray, 31, who reports on women's issues for HuffPost and remembers staring upward during a quiet moment at the Javits Center on election night.

'I think it would be hard not to reach the conclusion that this is the person who would be the most passionate advocate for the things we've been fighting for for a long time.' ... Questions of who [Kamala] is, what sits at her core, and why exactly she wants to be president have become central to her campaign and chances of winning. Few, if anyone, have had these concerns about Maya, and Maya doesn't have these concerns about Kamala.

It was a window into his certitude and self-confidence that belies a lack of careful study or deep knowledge of the world.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That Oct. 6 call, just like his July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, would have played out very differently if Trump had listened to the warnings of his advisers at the White House and appointees in the national security apparatus.</p><p>\"Mr. Trump's error, some aides concede in off-the-record conversations, was entering the Oct. 6 call underprepared, and then failing to spell out for Mr. Erdogan the potential consequences - from economic sanctions to a contraction of Turkey's alliance with the United States and its standing in NATO. He has since threatened both, retroactively,\" David Sanger reports in today's New York Times. \"The horrors that have played out with lightning speed were clearly not anticipated by Mr. Trump, who has no fondness for briefing books and meetings in the Situation Room intended to game out events two or three moves ahead. Instead, he often talks about trusting his instincts. 'My gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me,' he said late last year.\"</p><p>             -- Some of this is a result of Trump surrounding himself with more \"yes men\" than during the first two years of his administration. Jim Mattis, you might recall, resigned as secretary of defense last December after Trump initially announced he would withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.</p><p>\"During deliberations in the past, Trump has repeatedly pushed to remove troops from Syria but has usually been dissuaded by top officials, such as John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff,\" Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey reported on Sunday. \"The usual argument against removing troops, according to former senior administration officials, would be that doing so would cause widespread deaths and chaos and Trump would be blamed for it. 'Normally, convincing him he would be blamed for death and chaos could keep it from happening at least at that moment,' one former senior administration official said. But current administration officials say many moderating officials like Kelly are gone, and longtime friends say the move is consistent with Trump's worldview - and that he has long wanted to do this.\"</p><p>             -- Even then, though, Trump has repeatedly disregarded warnings from well-intentioned aides who appear to have been trying earnestly to keep him from making unforced errors or wading into legally perilous waters.          </p><p>             Fiona Hill,             who was Trump's             top adviser             on Russia             in the White Hous             e             , told impeachment investigators on Monday that Rudy Giuliani, Trump's fixer, ran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that circumvented American officials and diplomats in order to personally benefit the president. \"In a closed-door session that lasted roughly 10 hours, Hill told lawmakers that she confronted Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, about Giuliani's activities which, she testified, were not coordinated with the officials responsible for carrying out U.S. foreign policy,\" Karoun Demirjian, Shane Harris and Rachael Bade report. \"Hill testified Monday that [then-national security adviser John] Bolton was furious over Giuliani's politically motivated activities in Ukraine, two officials familiar with her testimony said. She recounted how Bolton likened the former New York mayor to a 'hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up,' one of these people said...</p><p>\"Bolton and Sondland met in early July with then-special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, Hill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. During the meeting, Sondland's agenda for Ukraine began to become clear, when he blurted out to the other officials present that there were 'investigations that were dropped that need to be started up again' ... Hill told lawmakers that after the meeting, Bolton instructed her to go raise their concerns about the shadow Ukraine operations with White House lawyers. Bolton said he didn't want to be part of any 'drug deal' that was being cooked up on Ukraine, one person familiar with Hill's testimony said. Hill met with NSC lawyer John Eisenberg to express her concerns about Giuliani's activities and how they were being carried out by Sondland and Volker...\"</p><p>             --             It remains unclear whether or when Eisenberg passed these concerns up the chain of command. The Post reported last week that at least four national security officials sounded alarms before Trump's call. That meeting with Sondland and the others was on July 10, for example, a full two weeks before the July 25 call in which Trump asked for a \"favor,\" according to the rough summary released by the White House.</p><p>             Hill, who finally left the Capitol at 8:25 p.m., is the first former Trump White House official to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry. She left the NSC voluntarily this summer and appeared before Congress after a subpoena was issued, despite White House Counsel Pat Cipollone's stated desire to block administration witnesses from appearing and his refusal to turn over documents. Eisenberg reports to Cipollone.</p><p>             -- The Times has a fuller version of the \"drug deal\" quote that includes the acting White House chief of staff: \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and [Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up,\" Bolton, a Yale-trained lawyer, purportedly told Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to two people who were at the deposition. \"Another person in the room initially said Mr. Bolton referred to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mulvaney, but two others said he cited Mr. Sondland,\" Peter Baker and Nicholas Fandos report.</p><p>\"At one point, she confronted Mr. Sondland, who had inserted himself into dealings with Ukraine even though it was not part of his official portfolio ... He told her that he was in charge of Ukraine, a moment she compared to Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s declaration that he was in charge after the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt ... According to whom, she asked. The president, he answered. ...</p><p>\"Ms. Hill testified that she opposed the idea of the July 25 telephone call ... because she did not understand its purpose. While it was described as a congratulatory call following parliamentary elections in Ukraine, Mr. Trump had already made a congratulatory call to Mr. Zelensky in April after his own election. She was not told that Mr. Trump would use the call to press for an investigation into [Hunter] Biden, nor did she know about the president's decision to withhold $391 million in American assistance to Ukraine until shortly before her departure, according to one person informed about her account.\"</p><p>             -- This should be viewed as part of a pattern. The president, no doubt, thinks his wisdom is \"great and unmatched.\" This prompts him to not follow traditional decision-making channels and to ignore advice from seasoned foreign policy hands, which has in turn led to some of the blunders that now cloud the future of his presidency.</p><p>             In some cases, it's not clear what information has been passed along to him. Volker, who was the special U.S. envoy to Ukraine, testified under oath that he warned Giuliani against trusting the information he was receiving from Ukrainian political figures about Joe Biden and his son. He said during his deposition on Oct. 3 that he tried to caution Giuliani that his Ukrainian sources were unreliable and that he should be careful about putting faith in their theories, but it was to no avail.</p><p>             In other cases, though, aides say they've expressed concerns to the president directly - only to have them ignored. Tom Bossert, Trump's former top homeland security adviser at the White House, said he personally told the president on multiple occasions that a conspiracy theory about Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election was \"completely debunked.\" Appearing on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sept. 29, Bossert faulted the president for still bringing up the baseless idea during his call with Ukraine's president that the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike played a role in shielding the Democratic National Committee's server. Bossert blamed Giuliani and others outside the national security apparatus for \"repeating that debunked theory to the president.\" Bossert said there is no doubt that Russia behind the hack.</p><p>\"It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again, and, for clarity here, ... let me just repeat that it has no validity,\" Bossert said. \"That conspiracy theory has got to go. ... If he continues to focus on that white whale, it's going to bring him down.\"</p><p>             There are many other examples: Trump ignored specific warnings from his national security advisers last year when he congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection - which experts said was rigged. A section in his briefing materials literally said in all-capital letters \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE.\"</p><p>Trump also reportedly refused to stop using his personal iPhone in the White House, despite repeated warnings from U.S. intelligence officials that Chinese and Russian spies are routinely listening in on his conversations.</p><p>Mattis and Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state,\u00a0warned Trump about the destabilizing repercussions that would follow if he pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement. He ignored them, and their warnings have come to fruition.</p><p>Trump ignoredwarnings from his top economic advisers that a trade war with China would not be \"easy to win.\"</p><p>Chris Christie, who chaired Trump's transition team, has said he warned the president-elect not to hire Michael Flynn as national security adviser. Flynn only survived a few weeks on the job and has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- The Nationals are one win from the World Series after crushing the Cardinals 8-1 last night, taking a 3-0 lead in the National League Championship Series. \"Some crowd roars in sports are different,\" writes Thomas Boswell. \"Especially if those roars have been on hold for 86 years. The explosion in Nationals Park on Monday night as Howie Kendrick's line drive smacked off the right field scoreboard, scoring two runs and putting the Washington Nationals ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals 4-0 in the third inning, ... was like nothing heard in a ballpark in D.C. since the Great Depression.\"</p><p>\"This run, dating back to the eight-game winning streak that closed the regular season, is now 15 wins in 17 games,\" adds Barry Svrluga. \"During it, the Nats snuffed the postseason hopes of both the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cleveland Indians. [And the Milwaukee Brewers.] Since the playoffs started, they kneecapped the 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers and are in the process of absolutely suffocating the Cardinals. Pick your stat to show the dominance, but here's a favorite: There have been 27 innings played in this series. The Nats have been tied after five of them - and led after the other 22. ...</p><p>\"In order for the Cardinals to push this series back to St. Louis, they have to beat the Nationals in back-to-back games, games that will be started by $140 million lefty Patrick Corbin and veteran right-hander An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, who was last seen carrying a no-hitter into the eighth inning of his start against the Cards in Game 1. The last time the Nats lost consecutive games: a month ago, Sept. 13 and 14, to the Atlanta Braves.\"</p><p>             Even if goes to STL, Washington needs to win just one of the next four games to advance past the NLCS: \"Only one team in history, the 2004 New York Yankees, had a 3-0 lead in a seven-game series and didn't win,\" Jesse Dougherty and Sam Fortier note in their game recap.</p><p>             Washington's lineup is fully healthy again: \"Their every day center fielder, Victor Robles, returned ... after a mild right hamstring strain he suffered last week,\" Sam Fortier reports.</p><p>St. Louis vows to \"bite, scratch, and claw\" its way back,\u00a0Isabelle Khurshudyan reports from their clubhouse.</p><p>             Split-screen: Game 4 starts at 8:05 p.m.\u00a0on TBS, and the Democratic presidential debate starts at 8 p.m. on CNN.</p><p>             THE WORLD IS ON FIRE:          </p><p>             -- Trump called on Erdogan to implement a cease-fire in northern Syria, and imposed sanctions against Turkey, in response to its military aggression.             Vice President Pence and national security adviser Robert O'Brien will lead a delegation to Turkey in an effort to end violence in the region.Seung Min Kim and Karen DeYoung report: \"Pence said that Erdogan and Trump spoke by phone on Monday and that the president 'communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, to implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence.' ... The sanctions are aimed at Turkey's Defense and Energy ministries, as well as three senior Turkish officials. Among them was the interior minister, a powerful position responsible for domestic security. ... Along with the sanctions, Trump also said that tariffs on steel imports from Turkey will be raised 50 percent and that the United States has halted negotiations over a $100 billion trade deal with the country.\"</p><p>             -- The markets don't see Trump's new tariffs as significant: The Turkish lira actually rose as markets opened.per CNBC.</p><p>             -- Syrian troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad advanced into several additional key towns across northeastern Syria after striking a last-minute deal with Kurdish fighters to help them fight the Turks,\u00a0dramatically altering the balance of power inside the country.Erin Cunningham, Sarah Dadouch, Asser Khattab and Dan Lamothe report: \"Kurdish authorities reached a surprise agreement with the Syrian government to return Assad's forces to the northeast of the country. Government forces lost control of the territory amid the civil war that erupted after the Arab Spring protests of eight years ago. The Syrian deployments represent a stunning reversal for the Kurdish-led administration and allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which had partnered with the United States to battle the Islamic State in the area. The deal was made to allow Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, according to Syrian Kurdish officials, who said their administration would maintain control of local institutions. Syria's government, however, sees the agreement as effectively killing Kurdish ambitions to establish a de facto state in the country's northeast, said Kamal Jafa, a pro-government military analyst in the Syrian city of Aleppo.\"</p><p>-- \"Over the weekend, State and Energy Department officials were quietly reviewing plans for evacuating roughly 50 tactical nuclear weapons that the United States had long stored, under American control, at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, about 250 miles from the Syrian border,\" the Times reports. \"Those weapons, one senior official said, were now essentially Erdogan's hostages. To fly them out of Incirlik would be to mark the de facto end of the Turkish-American alliance. To keep them there, though, is to perpetuate a nuclear vulnerability that should have been eliminated years ago. 'I think this is a first - a country with U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in it literally firing artillery at US forces,' Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies wrote last week. For his part, Mr. Erdogan claims nuclear ambitions of his own: Only a month ago, speaking to supporters, he said he 'cannot accept' rules that keep Turkey from possessing nuclear weapons of its own.\"</p><p>             -- Erdogan's moves have generated little public backlash or even debate back home in Turkey.Kareem Fahim reports: \"Turkish celebrities and athletes have rallied behind the military. Opposition parties have been broadly supportive. Flag-waving Turks greet soldiers in border towns as they prepare for battle, and the news media memorializes Erdogan's utterances in headlines. At the same time, critical voices in Turkey have been cowed, shouted down and in some cases detained. ... Trump's threats against Turkey - including the imposition Monday of sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior officials - were unlikely to dent Erdogan's support.\"</p><p>             -- The Saudi ambassador to the U.K. accused Turkey of causing chaos in Syria, but he also said that Riyadh is losing confidence in Trump.From the Guardian: Prince Khalid bin Bander bin Sultan Al Saud \"also claimed his country had much more to lose than Iran from a conflict between the two countries and wanted to behave as 'the adults in the room' by not escalating tensions with Tehran. He said Saudi Arabia would have further to fall if a conflict took place. Breaking with the normal Saudi diplomatic silence in the UK, the ambassador, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute defence thinktank, said: 'The Turkish assault is creating chaos. The last thing we need is another front of chaos in the region and I think we just got it.'\"</p><p>             -- When it comes to Middle East policy, there's one country everyone is talking to now: Russia.Will Englund reports: \"Analysts say that American confusion, bungling and missteps - especially in the past few days - have opened the door to the Middle East for Russia. Moscow, by not talking about human rights and transparency, is a welcome change of pace from the West, they say. ... But experts question whether Russia, having established diplomatic beachheads, has the means to bend the Middle East to its will. ... Vladimir Dzhabarov, the deputy head of the Federation Council foreign affairs committee, suggested that Russia and the United States could jointly broker further talks between the Kurds and Assad's government. Syria is just one item on the agenda during Putin's visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The price of oil is another - both Riyadh and Moscow believe its price should not be allowed to go too high. ... It is a balancing act for Moscow: Sow some friendship with one side, then the other; sow some uncertainty at the same time, get some deals done, some boots on the ground. Katz argues that Russia does not have an actual strategic goal for the Middle East. It wants to continue as a player and prevent any one side from becoming dominant.\"</p><p>             --\u00a0Russia said its units\u00a0are patrolling the area between Turkish and Syrian forces around city of Manbij, filling a security vacuum left behind by American troops.(Kareem Fahim, Sarah Dadouch and Erin Cunningham)</p><p>             -- How the Syrian crisis is playing:          </p><p>             -- Notable commentary from The Post's opinion page:          </p><p>             -- In Hong Kong, protesters are pleading for American protection as the government expands police powers and imposes new restrictions.Shibani Mahtani reports: \"'Our citizens do not have any kind of power to fight against the government,' said Crystal Yeung, 23, standing among thousands of protesters spilling out onto roads from a small square that couldn't contain the rally. 'We are relying on the U.S. to punish those who are trying to breach the Hong Kong law.' Protesters are specifically hoping for the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support. The bill, which will require the annual review of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong and allow sanctions on those found to be 'suppressing basic freedoms,' was fast-tracked through the House and could be discussed as soon as this week. In the Senate, it remains in committee.\"</p><p>             -- Struggling Deutsche Bank launched a brazen campaign to win business in China by charming and enriching the country's political elite,\u00a0according to the New York Times: \"Millions of dollars were paid out to Chinese consultants, including a business partner of the premier's family and a firm that secured a meeting for the bank's chief executive with the president. And more than 100 relatives of the Communist Party's ruling elite were hired for jobs at the bank, even though it had deemed many unqualified. ... It worked. By 2011, the German company would be ranked by Bloomberg as the top bank for managing initial public offerings in China and elsewhere in Asia, outside Japan. The bank's rule-bending rise to the top was chronicled in confidential documents, prepared by the company and its outside lawyers, that were obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. ... The documents show that Deutsche Bank's troubling behavior in China was far more extensive than the authorities in the United States have publicly alleged. And they show that the bank's top leadership was warned about the activity but did not stop it.\"</p><p>             THE LATEST ON THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:          </p><p>-- \"Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. \"Investigators also have examined Mr. Giuliani's bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Mr. Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Mr. Giuliani's role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates ... The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn't been informed of any investigation. ...</p><p>\"It couldn't be determined how far along the investigation stands. The scope of the inquiry also isn't known. Since April 2018, Mr. Giuliani has been President Trump's personal lawyer, work for which he isn't paid. Mr. Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last week on campaign-finance and conspiracy counts. The indictment accuses the two men of misrepresenting the sources of hundreds of thousands of dollars in U.S. campaign contributions they made ... Messrs. Parnas and Fruman remain in federal custody on $1 million bonds, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said, and haven't yet entered pleas. They are scheduled to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday.\"</p><p>             -- Giuliani was paid $500,000 by the company co-founded by Parnas. Giuliani told Reuters that Parnas'\u00a0company, which is literally called\u00a0Fraud Guarantee, hired his firm around August 2018.</p><p>             -- House Democrats are feeling much more confident about their impeachment inquiry after spending two weeks in their home districts.Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: \"Facing constituents at home, many lawmakers said they have gotten more encouragement - or at least less backlash - than they might have anticipated as public opinion polls now show more Americans supporting impeachment. ... Said Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.): 'I think we're much further along after two weeks away from Washington than people could have imagined.' ... On the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position [to stonewall] has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.\"</p><p>             -- Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is expected to testify behind closed doors on Wednesday. \"The testimony of McKinley, who resigned his position last week, could shed light on Pompeo's actions and how they have affected the State Department,\" Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner and Brittany Shammas report. \"Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper is expected to appear in closed session on Friday.\"</p><p>             -- Gordon Sondland, who is scheduled to appear on Thursday under subpoena, spent years angling to get his ambassadorship.Aaron C. Davis, Josh Dawsey, Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Michael Birnbaum have a profile: \"To realize his goal, Sondland made a political about-face and backed Donald Trump, a candidate he once said was out of touch with his 'personal beliefs and values on so many levels.' After the election, Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. And he began calling in political favors - including from Republican National Committee chairman turned White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus - to convince Trump that he could be a team player. ... Current and former U.S. officials and foreign diplomats say Sondland seemed to believe that if he delivered for Trump in Ukraine, he could ascend in the ranks of government. A person close to Sondland disputed that notion, but other officials said Sondland had been talked about in the administration as a possible successor to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\"</p><p>             -- Democrats asked to interview White House acting budget director Russ\u00a0Vought on Oct. 25, as part of their focus on the withholding of nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.</p><p>             THE OVERSHADOWED DOMESTIC AGENDA:          </p><p>             -- The white police\u00a0officer in Fort Worth who fatally shot a black woman in her own home has been charged with murder.Derek Hawkins and Deanna Paul report: \"The officer, Aaron Dean, who resigned earlier in the day, was booked into the Tarrant County Jail ... Bond has been set at $200,000, jail records show. Authorities moved quickly to arrest Dean after he shot Atatiana Jefferson through a closed window in her Fort Worth home while responding to a welfare call in the early hours of Saturday morning. In fatal officer-involved shootings, police seldom face criminal charges, and they are rarely charged with murder. ... The department has also asked the FBI to review Dean's actions for possible civil rights violations, according to the chief.\"</p><p>             -- Twelve presidential hopefuls will take the stage tonight in Westerville, Ohio, for the fourth Democratic debate. Here are\u00a02020-related developments that should be on your radar:</p><p>             -- Hunter Biden, in an interview with ABC News that aired this morning, insisted he did nothing wrong but acknowledged that \"it was poor judgment\" to \"be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways.\"\u00a0Sitting down in the kitchen of his Los Angeles home, the former vice president's son said: \"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake. So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever. ... Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\"</p><p>             -- Ohio was set to purge 235,000 voters last month,\u00a0but around 20 percent of the names on the list shouldn't have been on it.From the Times: \"Around 40,000 people, nearly one in five names on the list, shouldn't have been on it, the state determined. And it only found out before anyone was actually turned away at a polling place largely because of volunteer sleuthing. Few people had expected a problem at that scale. But the process gave hope to people working on voting rights, who for years had pushed the state to be more transparent in how it was maintaining its voter rolls. Moderate Republicans, caught between advocacy groups pushing for fewer purges and more conservative leaders in other states urging for more, think they may have found a way to thread the needle. 'We're talking about crowdsourcing, in simply putting the list out there,' said Frank LaRose, Ohio's secretary of state, whose office oversaw the purge and who manages the election here.\"</p><p>             -- House Democrats will release a plan to make college more affordable.Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports: \"Compared with some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' higher education proposals, including student debt forgiveness, the House bill is pretty tame. Still, the legislative package ... reforms that top the wish lists of many liberal policymakers. Yet it may not go far enough for some student advocates. ... The bill calls for expanding federal aid to low-income families by increasing Pell Grants and tying them to inflation so the value doesn't diminish. It would also create a grant program to help needy students address emergencies such as loss of housing or not having enough to eat.\"</p><p>             -- Border Patrol agents detained a woman, followed her to the emergency room and stayed with her as she received treatment, refusing to budge even as doctors came to ask her questions and give her medication.Teo Armus reports: \"Thomas Kennedy, who filmed videos documenting the incident, [said] the incident raises questions about the line - or lack thereof - between immigration enforcement and emergency medical care. ... 'A hospital should be a place where a patient is protected from interrogation,' Kennedy, the political director at the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in an interview. 'You shouldn't have a Border Patrol agent right there with you while you're getting treatment.'\"</p><p>             -- Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been inviting conservative pundits to his home in California for private dinners in an apparent bid to deflate growing pressure on the right for breaking up his company.Politico reports: \"The dinners, which began in July, are part of Zuckerberg's broader effort to cultivate friends on the right amid outrage by [Trump] and his allies over alleged 'bias' against conservatives at Facebook and other major social media companies. ...\u00a0News of the outreach is likely to further fuel suspicions on the left that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the White House and stay out of Trump's crosshairs. ... Facebook has been criticized in recent days, including by [Warren], for its ad policy, which exempts politicians from third-party fact-checking and arguably facilitates the spread of disinformation. ...</p><p>             \"As part of the series, Zuckerberg met earlier this year with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who insinuated that Facebook had become a monopoly during a congressional hearing last year; Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has fingered Zuckerberg as contributing to 'the death of free speech in America'; and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt, who has cautioned against a DOJ enforcement action but has called for a 'new regulatory regime' to minimize 'big tech bias' against conservatives. ... Facebook's critics on the left have argued that the company is overcorrecting and trying to curry favor with the Trump administration as it faces increasing scrutiny over its sloppy privacy practices and potential monopoly in social media.\"</p><p>             SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:          </p><p>Trump criticized House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff for saying it may not be necessary for the first whistleblower to testify before Congress in person.

So did producers of corn, soybeans, wheat and pork. They're all getting another round of handouts from the Department of Agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But many of King's constituents have also been suffering, and they're getting the shaft from their government. Lobster exports to China, which had been booming for years, have plummeted 84 percent since Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs last July, according to new data from the Maine International Trade Center. The growing Chinese middle class is eating more lobsters from Canada, which now cost them a quarter to a third less but taste no different.</p><p>             \"We've got an industry that's suffering exactly the same kind of negative effects,\" King said in an interview. \"Why not lobsters? There's no logical distinction that I can see. ... I'm sure a lot of people in Maine had the same reaction I did watching that press conference:             What are we, chopped lobster?\"          </p><p>To be sure, chopped lobster from Maine sounds delicious - especially if it's thinly coated in mayonnaise and stuffed into a hot dog bun that's been lightly toasted in butter. But, in all seriousness, King's frustration underscores the degree to which Trump and his political appointees in Washington have been picking winners and losers. The lobster industry has been one of the losers.</p><p>             Advocates for lobstermen in Maine say they feel like they're getting ignored because they're not as politically valuable to Trump as farmers in the Midwest.             They think it's only fair that seafood should get the same treatment as soybeans. The administration's two big bailout packages have appeared designed to get relief to farmers in battleground states who supported him in 2016 and who will be critical to his reelection next year. Because he remains unpopular in the suburbs, the president's narrow path to a second term requires running up the score again in rural areas of swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.</p><p>             King, who caucuses with the Democrats, called me from France yesterday after attending the ceremony to honor the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Today he will send a letter to Trump with the three other members of the Maine congressional delegation, including Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Democratic Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden. They are asking for \"relief similar to the aid you are providing to our nation's farmers,\" as well as more federal help to grow domestic demand for lobsters and assist with the development of new markets. For example, the Canadians negotiated a trade agreement with the European Union that allows them to significantly undercut the Maine lobsters on price. They want the U.S. government to cut a deal that rectifies that. Two spokeswomen for the USDA did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>             Collins said the retaliatory tariffs have caused \"tremendous harm\" to Maine's economy. \"Lobster dealers have told me that their business with the Chinese ... has virtually disappeared as the Chinese are now going to Canadian dealers to get their lobster,\" the four-term senator said in a statement. \"While the administration has provided financial relief to our nation's farmers, the lobster industry has not been included. The administration should provide similar relief to the thousands of Mainers from harvesters to dealers to processors and others.\"</p><p>             Just like with farmers, there are other challenges beyond trade that are complicating the lives of people who depend on lobsters for their livelihoods - including climate change. Harvesters are concerned about new regulations related to whales, as well as \"rapidly changing ocean conditions, shifting stock patterns, and an expected shortage of bait,\" the lawmakers note in their letter. The price of lobster traps has also gone up because of the steel tariffs. \"This confluence of factors is a serious threat and the federal government should play a stabilizing role to ensure its continued success,\" the letter said. There are 4,500 licensed lobstermen in Maine, and one study found that the industry has an economic impact of $1.5 billion on the state.</p><p>             For his part, Trump continues to dig in. He told reporters yesterday in Ireland that he could raise tariffs on China by another $300 billion, prompting Beijing to say it would respond in kind. \"We'll see what happens,\" the president said. \"But I think China wants to make a deal.\"</p><p>             Analysts say it would be surprising if the lobster world got the help being requested. Where do you draw the line? Would anyone who sells food to China get a piece of the pie? The International Monetary Fund estimated on Wednesday that $455 billion in gross domestic product will be lost - and global economic output could be cut by 0.5 percent in 2020 - because of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. In other words, a lot of people could legitimately claim harm and ask for government help.</p><p>             There are some political reasons it might make sense for Trump to help Maine: The president carried one of the state's four electoral votes in 2016, because they're divided up by congressional district, and Collins is a top target of national Democrats in 2020. Collins, a moderate, is the only Republican survivor among the 33 members of Congress from New England.</p><p>             She's favored still to win reelection in the blue state, which is why some of the top Democratic recruits appear to be taking a pass on running, but it will be tougher for the incumbent than the last few cycles. Her approval rating has taken a hit because of her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, despite Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, and other judicial nominees who have demonstrated hostility toward abortion rights. On the other hand, those votes have improved her standing among Republicans back home who eyed her skeptically after she declined to vote for Trump in 2016 and offered a decisive vote to save Obamacare from being repealed in 2017.</p><p>             Economically, what's happening in Maine captures in miniature both the long-term damage and the unintended consequences that the trade war could bring. The congressional letter cites the struggles of Maine Coast, a lobster wholesaler in York. About a quarter of the company's business a year ago was with China. It has lost 90 percent of that because of the tariffs. It is dealers like these that have taken the biggest hit. So far, prices have stayed somewhat stable for the people who go out on boats to collect lobsters from traps and sell them when they get back to the wharf, but everyone involved expects the decline in demand will inevitably cause that to change.</p><p>             \"There's a lot of uncertainty,\" said Sheila Adams, who runs sales and marketing for Maine Coast. \"That's probably been the part that's worn us down the most. The uncertainty. We've had to do everything differently.\"</p><p>             The Chinese market had been the fastest-growing export market. Chinese customers bought $128.5 million of Maine lobster in 2017, the last full year without the tariffs. Thanks partly to unexpectedly large harvests of the crustaceans, lobster exports to the country were on track to be up 169 percent year over year based on sales during the first half of 2018. Then sales screeched to a halt.</p><p>             Now Maine Coast is trying to expand sales domestically, as well as in other Southeast Asian countries like South Korea and Vietnam. \"But every U.S. lobster dealer has had to look to the same markets, so it's a little scrappier, and it takes a lot of those other markets to match the one market of mainland China,\" said Adams.</p><p>             In an interview last night, she worried that her biggest Chinese customers are forging new relationships with her Canadian competitors, but she said she can't blame them because this is a totally rational thing for consumers to do. \"We spent five years on marketing and operational expansions to support the needs of Chinese customers. It took years to build those markets. You don't recover overnight.\"</p><p>             Adams and her husband, Tom, who founded the company, desperately do not want to lay off any of their 45 employees in a small town of 12,500. \"Mainers find a way. Resilience is the Maine way,\" she said. \"Certainly, the longer this goes, the more challenging it becomes. ... Relief funds could allow us to ride it out.\"</p><p>             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          </p><p>             -- Hiring dipped in May, the Labor Department announced this morning, as firms cooled off on hiring amid the concern over the trade war.Heather Long reports: \"The U.S. economy added 75,000 jobs in May, a significant pullback from 224,000 jobs added in April. The unemployment rate remained at a five decade low of 3.6 percent. Manufacturing and construction saw anemic job growth in May with less than 5,000 jobs added in each sector, one of the clearest signs that Trump's tariffs are having a negative impact on blue-collar sectors the president has been trying to boost. 'This looks like an economy that is slowing down, which doesn't mean that we're necessarily entering a recession. It does mean that we likely will not have the strength that we had in past years,' said Martha Gimbel, research director for Indeed.com's Hiring Lab.\"</p><p>             GET SMART FAST:  </p><p>             2020 WATCH:          </p><p>             -- Well,\u00a0that was quick: Joe Biden declared last night he no longer supports the ban on federal funding for abortions, capitulating quickly to pressure from the\u00a0left after searing criticism from his 2020 rivals and women's groups. \"Circumstances have changed,\" he said, literally a day after his campaign put out a statement reiterating his commitment to the Hyde Amendment.\u00a0Colby Itkowitz reports:\u00a0\"The former vice president announced the change during a speech at the Democratic National Committee's African American Leadership Council summit in Atlanta, telling the crowd that, in an environment where the\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision on abortion is under attack in Republican-held states, he could no longer support a policy that limits funding. 'We've seen state after state including Georgia passing extreme laws,' Biden said. 'It's clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of\u00a0Roe.'\"</p><p>             This is a risky move because it feeds into the emerging narrative that Biden lacks core convictions and is a finger-in-the-wind career politician. On the other hand, if he hadn't reversed himself, you'd be reading stories all weekend and watching cable discussions about his problems with Democratic women voters. And the first debate would have been dominated by attacks over his apostasies. Yesterday's Daily 202 laid out several data points to suggest Biden would probably cave on this issue, but we didn't think it would be this fast and this clunky. The awkward handling of the issue suggests the 76-year-old's political instincts may be\u00a0rusty.</p><p>             Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) says she's \"not surprised\" by Biden's reversal.\u00a0\"I think it would have been a big problem for him,\" she said last night on MSNBC.</p><p>             -- Montana Gov. Steve Bullock's manager complained the campaign was blindsided by a rules change for debate qualifications, a charge the DNC denies.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: \"The initial debate rules did not limit the types of polls that could be used to qualify, and they included polls by The Washington Post and ABC News, which had already conducted January polling in which respondents volunteered which candidate they support rather than choosing from a list of candidates. But the DNC publicly announced Thursday that such open-ended polls will not count to meet the debate threshold, since voters can include non-candidates in their responses. As a result, Bullock cannot use a Post-ABC poll from January, in which he scored 1 percent, as his third qualifying poll. 'We notified the Bullock campaign in early March, so they have known for months,'\u00a0said Xochitl Hinojosa, the party's communications director. [Bullock's\u00a0campaign manager]\u00a0criticized the party for 'excluding an open-ended poll that's actually harder to register in, and by not sharing the rule in writing with all presidential campaigns.'\"</p><p>             -- They call this pulling a Chris Dodd: Marianne Williamson, the spiritual guru who is running for president, has moved to Iowa in the hope of gaining more support from the Hawkeye State's voters.CNN's Donald Judd reports: \"Her campaign indicated that the candidate has claimed a Des Moines condominium as her residence for nearly three months. 'Marianne has moved to Des Moines and our campaign is fully committed to the Iowa caucus process,' Brent Roske, Williamson's Iowa chair, told CNN in a statement Thursday, 'as well as to the other early states including New Hampshire where former US Representative Paul Hodes is our State Director.'\"</p><p>             -- After drifting out of the top tier, Kamala Harris is shifting strategy and staffing up in Iowa. She initially appeared to think she could do minimal work there and instead focus on winning South Carolina. The Californian aims to send\u00a065 paid staffers into the state by July.The Des Moines Register's Brianne Pfannenstiel reports: \"'It's game on,' said Harris' Iowa campaign chairwoman, Deidre DeJear. Harris so far has lagged behind some campaigns, which have sought to aggressively add staff in the state. ... She's also made fewer visits to Iowa than many of her competitors ... DeJear said the slower build-up here was an intentional effort to conserve resources, ensure organizers don't burn out, and wait for potential caucusgoers to become more engaged.\"</p><p>             -- \"For many black voters, 2020 isn't about pride or making history. It's about beating Trump,\"by the Los Angeles Times's Mark Z. Barabak: \"Black voters, and black women in particular, are the bedrock of the Democratic Party. Given their large numbers in early-voting states such as South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana, they will have tremendous sway in choosing the party's nominee. Some believe that tilts the race away from Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke or other relatively centrist white males in favor of a more progressive candidate or person of color. But nationwide polling, focus group interviews and conversations with campaign strategists, voters and political activists across Alabama suggest many African Americans aren't focused on policy or making history by, say, putting Harris or another woman in the White House.\"</p><p>             -- The Democrats running for president are wooing Silicon Valley executives for donations even as they bash their companies on the trail.The Times's Shane Goldmacher and Stephanie Saul report: \"The progressive base has already soured on Wall Street, fossil fuel and pharmaceutical cash. Silicon Valley had been, until recently, one of the last relatively untainted wellsprings from which to draw campaign contributions. Now, some, particularly on the left, say tech money is suspect, too. 'Many of the candidates are trying to have it both ways,' said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party's progressive wing, who recently called on Democratic political consultants to stop representing corporate clients, 'but it will be hard to be taken seriously as strong on this issue when you're taking money hand over fist from Big Tech.'\"</p><p>             INSIDE KOCH WORLD 2020 PLANNING:          </p><p>             -- Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the constellation of organizations backed by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, says it will focus its 2019-2020 activities on supporting certain candidates in state and federal primary races, regardless of party. Michelle Ye Hee Lee emails this dispatch for the 202: Officials said in a memo on Friday morning they plan to help candidates who are \"Republican, Democrat, independent or otherwise,\" who have shown they will \"stick their necks out to lead diverse policy coalitions,\" and help take the pressure off of candidates who may worry about making certain policy decisions because they are worried about backlash from their party. \"Our criteria is not about Republican or Democrat. It's about what people are doing and how they lead. ... The way they win re-election matters,\" Emily Seidel, chief executive of AFP, said in an interview.</p><p>             The announcement is a part of an ongoing effort by Koch officials to rebrand as less overtly political and more conciliatory\u00a0after years of being portrayed as boogeymen by the left. The Koch groups are again sitting out of the presidential race, after declining to endorse a candidate in the 2016 presidential elections.\u00a0The network of political groups, tax-exempt organizations, wealthy donors and political activists recently reorganized under the name of its nonprofit arm, Stand Together. After spending millions to elect Republicans across the country and becoming a stable fixture on the right, the network has shied away from Trump and the Republican Party's move toward protectionism and nativism. Koch has signaled he wants to turn away from partisan politics and focus more on policy priorities that cut across ideologies. \"If there ever was a time for a new approach, now is that time,\" said Brian Hooks, who leads the network of Koch-backed groups, in an interview yesterday.</p><p>             It remains to be seen whether any non-Republicans will receive the full backing of AFP, its wealthy donors and its network of activists. So far, the super PAC AFP Action has endorsed one Koch ally for reelection for this election cycle: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky. AFP reiterated Friday it will help candidates whose track records are most closely aligned with their major policy priorities, such as overhauling the criminal justice system, a permanent solution for the status of \"dreamers\" and free trade.\u00a0They plan to release their slate of candidates in the coming months.</p><p>             As part of the rollout for 2020, four new issue-based political action committees will be created: Uniting for Economic Opportunity, Uniting for Free Expression, Uniting for Free Trade\u00a0and Uniting for Immigration Reform. These four PACs, which can make direct contributions to candidates, would be created in addition to the existing efforts by AFP and AFP Action.</p><p>             MORE\u00a0ON THE TRADE WARS:          </p><p>             -- Mexico is trying to avoid American tariffs from going into effect next week by offering to deport more Central American asylum seekers.Nick Miroff, David J. Lynch and Kevin Sieff report: \"Mexican officials have pledged to deploy up to 6,000 national guard troops to the area of the country's border with Guatemala, a show of force they say will immediately reduce the number of Central Americans heading north toward the U.S. border. The plan, a sweeping overhaul of asylum rules across the region, would require Central American migrants to seek refuge in the first country they enter after leaving their homeland, the two officials said. For Guatemalans, that would be Mexico. For migrants from Honduras and El Salvador, that would be Guatemala, whose government held talks last week with acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan. Any migrants who made it to the U.S. border generally would be deported to the appropriate third country. And any migrants who express a fear of death or torture in their home country would be subjected to a tougher screening standard by U.S. asylum officers more likely to result in rejection.\"          </p><p>             -- An analysis showed that America\u00a0could lose more than 400,000 jobs if Trump follows throw on imposing tariffs against Mexico.Rachel Siegel reports: \"The Mexican tariffs alone could erase more than $41 billion in gross domestic product for the United States, along with $24.6 billion in income each year, according to the [Texas-based economic consulting firm] Perryman Group. Overall job losses could hit 406,000.\"</p><p>             -- Trump has the upper hand in the trade war, but only until September.Heather Long reports: \"There's a case to be made that Trump has the upper hand in these trade disputes because the United States buys more from China and Mexico than those countries buy from the United States. To put it another way, China and Mexico need Trump economically more than he needs them. But that's just the raw economic calculation. Trump is also facing a campaign for reelection in 2020, and he's banking on a strong economy to propel him to victory. There are already signs that Trump's trade policies are making the markets and economy jittery, and the pain is likely to escalate if he doesn't make some deals by September.\"</p><p>             -- The Federal Reserve, which Trump has frequently derided, might\u00a0put the brakes on the president's trade war.Long reports: \"Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell and other Fed officials have signaled this week that they may have to cut interest rates in coming months to keep the economic expansion going - and counter any economic harm from Trump's escalating trade war. Such a move would be highly unusual. It would come at a time when the economy has been growing quickly, and inflation and unemployment are low. And it could serve almost as an insurance policy on the impact of actions taken by the president, potentially facilitating his use of tariffs in unpredictable ways. ... The Fed is likely to signal its next step at its policy meeting this month, and markets are forecasting at least three interest-rate cuts by the end of the year.\"</p><p>             -- Russia's leading meat producer told China that it's ready to fill the food supply gap left by the U.S. as the trade war drags on.\u00a0The South China Morning Post's Laura Zhou reports: \"Cherkizovo Group, the largest meat producer in Russia, began shipping poultry products to China last month, and is now looking forward to selling pork and soybeans there, according to CEO Sergey Mikhailov ... Hopes that China would buy more pork, soybean and other protein products from the U.S. were dashed last month after trade negotiations with the Trump administration fell apart.\"\u00a0</p><p>             -- \"Trump is not winging it. Or at least he's not totally winging it,\"John Harris argues in Politico with Luiza Ch. Savage: \"In Trump's case, that strategy is intuitive. He's been saying since the 1980s - and by all evidence genuinely believes - that the United States is letting itself be played for the fool by foreign adversaries, on trade specifically and global competition generally. ... In the case of his advisers, the theory of the case is more intellectual. They believe that the big bet free trade advocates made in the 1990s - that welcoming China into the WTO would encourage it to integrate into a rules-based global economy - has proved to be a loser.\"</p><p>             \"I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us,\" said Michael Pillsbury, an influential adviser to the Trump administration on China and author of the book, \"The Hundred Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.\" \"I finally woke up. But I would not say everybody's awakened even at this point.\"</p><p>             -- The president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in 2015 on his radio show that Trump's proposed trade policies would cause \"incalculable damage\" to the U.S. economy.CNN's Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski report: \"In segments on his show, Kudlow said the tariffs Trump then sought and has now moved to impose on China and Mexico would damage the US economy enormously -- and also said that Mexico's government was not to blame for undocumented immigrants coming to the U.S. The comments from Kudlow harshly contradict the administration's current positions on trade, which Kudlow is now tasked with publicly defending. ... Kudlow stood by the administration's current policies in a phone interview with CNN's KFile this week. 'That was then and this is now,' Kudlow said. 'I think his trade policies with China in particular have been very strong. They are not damaging the U.S. economy.'\"</p><p>             -- Facebook will no longer allow the pre-installation of its apps on Huawei phones.\u00a0Reuters's Katie Paul reports: \"Customers who already have Huawei phones will still be able to use its apps and receive updates, Facebook told Reuters. But new Huawei phones will no longer be able to have Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram apps pre-installed. Smartphone vendors often enter business deals to pre-install popular apps such as Facebook. Apps including Twitter and Booking.com also come pre-installed on Huawei phones in many markets ...\u00a0The move by Facebook dampens the sales outlook for Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, whose smartphone business became its biggest revenue generator last year, powered by strong growth in Europe and Asia.\"</p><p>             TRUMP IN EUROPE:          </p><p>             -- European leaders have refined their approach to Trump as they await the results of the 2020 election.Anne Gearan, Toluse Olorunnipa and James McAuley report: \"European leaders kept the three-country trip mostly to parades and pageantry, which seemed to suit Trump and his hosts just fine, rather than view the American president's arrival in Europe for D-Day commemorations as an opportunity to engage on policy debates. Brian Klaas, who teaches global politics at University College London, said many European leaders are taking a 'wait-and-see approach,' with the 2020 presidential election looming. 'Don't poke the bear and hope there's going to be a change in leadership,' he said. In ways big and small, world leaders found ways to manage the unpredictable American president ...</p><p>\"When Trump said that Britain's National Health Service would be 'on the table' in a potential U.S.-Britain trade deal - a prospect that would be highly unpopular there - May didn't directly contradict him. 'But the point about making trade deals is, of course, that both sides negotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future,' May said during a news conference in London. ... When Trump suggested that Ireland have a 'wall' to mark its border with Northern Ireland - a prospect that ginned up memories of bloody clashes between the two neighbors - Varadkar offered a swift but gentle pushback. ... And when reporters pointed out to Trump Thursday that he and Macron had different views about how to deal with Iran, Trump downplayed the differences - and Macron followed suit. 'I think we do share the same objectives on Iran,' Macron said during his meeting with the president in Caen.\"</p><p>\u00a0--             May officially stepped down today as the leader of the Conservative Party.From the BBC: \"Eleven Conservative MPs are vying to replace her as party leader and, ultimately, prime minister.

Mrs May remains acting party leader during the leadership election process.\"\u00a0</p><p>             -- Several members of Trump's family joined him on his trip this week, which has raised questions about whether taxpayers are picking up the tab.David Nakamura, Toluse Olorunnipa and Amanda Ferguson report: \"They sat for the white-tie dinner with Queen Elizabeth, toured the Churchill War Rooms, attended the 75th anniversary commemoration of the D-Day invasion in Normandy and, for the Trump sons, checked in on the family business at Trump International Golf Links &amp; Hotel in Doonbeg ... The question of who is paying for the family members' participation - and whether American taxpayers will be on the hook - has emerged as an unresolved subplot, with newspapers in Scotland and London scouring State Department databases and reporting on the fancy hotels and expensive limousines contracted by the U.S. government.\"</p><p>             -- During an interview with Fox News at the site of the D-Day landing, Trump called Bob Mueller \"a fool\" and Nancy Pelosi \"a disaster.\"John Wagner reports: \"During the interview with Fox News conducted ahead of a ceremony that paid tribute to soldiers who stormed a shore occupied by Nazi Germany 75 years ago, Trump said that Mueller - a former Marine who served in Vietnam - had made 'such a fool out of himself' last week when he made a public statement regarding his investigation into Russian election interference. Trump also referred to the Speaker\u00a0of the House as 'Nervous Nancy.' 'Nancy Pelosi is a disaster, okay? She's a disaster,' Trump said ... During a brief interview near the cemetery where nearly 10,000 American war dead are buried, [Pelosi told CNN that] she rather not criticize Trump while she is out of the country.\"</p><p>             -- One of the most-read stories on our home page:\u00a0\"Trump's catastrophic fashion choices in England were not just a sign of bad taste.\"Fashion critic Robin Givhan writes: \"Fashion is diplomacy, and so what did this wardrobe say? For any man to bungle white-tie dress - something so regimented, so steeped in tradition, so well-documented - he must be a man who doesn't bother with the details, who doesn't avail himself of ready expertise, who refuses to be a student of history or even of Google. ... The president's iteration of white tie at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace was, in a word, a mess. The waistcoat was too long and too tight. The tailcoat did not fit. The trousers were voluminous. And the man himself looked so ill at ease in the whole unfortunate kit that his awkwardness loomed over him like Pig-Pen's dust cloud.

Trump tweeted a picture of himself holding the legislation and wrote, 'Puerto Rico should love President Trump. Without me, they would have been shut out!' In fact, the areas of the country ravaged by natural disasters have had to wait months for the assistance because Trump pushed back against including more money for Puerto Rico.\"</p><p>             -- The Federal Communications Commission approved new rules that could make it easier for telecom giants to block suspected robocalls on behalf of their subscribers.Tony Romm reports: \"Under the order, telecom carriers have a legal greenlight to enroll consumers in their call-blocking services by default, as opposed to waiting for customers to sign up for such tools on their own. The change would 'make it easier for consumers' to get robocall relief, said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, noting that many people often are unaware such technology exists. 'There is one thing in our country that unites Republicans and Democrats,' Pai said. 'They are sick and tired of being bothered by unwanted robocalls.'\"</p><p>             -- The Department of Veterans Affairs owes at least $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who overpaid on their home loans.Colby Itkowitz reports: \"A review by VA's Office of Inspector General released Thursday found that from 2012 through 2017, more than half of the veterans entitled to this added benefit paid the fee and never received reimbursement from the government. The Veterans Benefits Administration, in its response to the inspector general report, agreed to identify the exempt veterans who paid the fee and issue them refunds. The VBA noted that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, the inspector general report says.\"</p><p>             -- Automakers told Trump that his pollution rules could mean \"untenable\" instability and lower profits.The Times's Coral Davenport reports: \"In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama's signature policies to fight climate change. The carmakers are addressing a crisis that is partly of their own making. They had sought some changes to the pollution standards early in the Trump presidency, but have since grown alarmed at the expanding scope of the administration's plan.\"</p><p>             -- Stephen Moore, who last month abandoned his bid for a Federal Reserve seat amid a firestorm over his comments about women, is still eyeing a job with Trump.Felicia Sonmez reports: \"Moore, a Heritage Foundation fellow, said Thursday in an interview with Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney that he 'may do something at the White House or in the campaign.' Moore added that he spoke with Trump a few weeks ago - before Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, announced his departure - and that he is not seeking to succeed Hassett in the role, which requires Senate confirmation. 'Well no, no one has,' Moore said when asked whether anyone from the White House had contacted him about potentially taking Hassett's place.\"</p><p>             THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:          </p><p>             -- Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, fired his attorneys and retained a new counsel.Spencer S.

Anthony declined to comment Thursday beyond a one-page filing in which they requested that their law firm withdraw as counsel, advising the federal court in Washington that Flynn 'has notified the undersigned that he is terminating Covington &amp; Burling LLP as his counsel and has already retained new counsel for this matter.' Kelner and Anthony asked U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Washington to allow them to withdraw. Flynn's new counsel was not identified but would be expected to notify the court through a filing on the public docket. On Thursday, Sullivan also directed that court officials release an audio version of a previously released transcript of a sensitive call between lawyers for Trump and Flynn. ... A new sentencing date has not been set. Flynn is expected to testify in Alexandria, Va., at the federal trial of his former business partner Bijan Kian in July. Kian has been charged with working as an unregistered agent of Turkey; he has pleaded not guilty.\"</p><p>             -- Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in the Mueller report, was a State Department intelligence source.

Under the proposal, committee chairs seeking to enforce its subpoenas in federal court would still be required to obtain the approval of a bipartisan - but Democrat-controlled - panel of House leaders.\"</p><p>             -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D) told other Democratic leaders that Mueller could be subpoenaed in the next two weeks.Politico's Desiderio and Heather Caygle report: \"The sources cautioned that the committee has not settled on a timetable for a potential subpoena to Mueller. Speaker Nancy Pelosi hosted the meeting, and four other committee chairs were in attendance. On Wednesday, Nadler told reporters that he was 'confident' Mueller will appear before his panel, and that he would issue a subpoena 'if we have to.' 'We want him to testify openly. I think the American people need that,' Nadler added. 'I think, frankly, it's his duty to the American people. And we'll make that happen.'\"</p><p>             -- During the meeting, Nadler -\u00a0who has publicly resisted calls to kick off an impeachment inquiry -\u00a0made the case to Pelosi for opening one.From CNN's Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb: \"First, Nadler argued opening an impeachment probe would centralize the House's sprawling investigations now spread across various panels into just one: The House Judiciary Committee. He argued that the other committees looking into various Trump controversies and scandals could instead focus on moving the party's legislative agenda, while his panel -- with its unique expertise -- would investigate the alleged crimes of Trump before deciding whether to formally vote on articles of impeachment. Secondly, Nadler made a technical argument that it would be easier for lawmakers to discuss the President's alleged offenses on the House floor and in committees during a formal impeachment inquiry because House rules forbid members from disparaging individuals. But Nadler met powerful resistance.\"</p><p>             -- Pelosi is defending her methodical approach to impeachment by offering a history lesson on how the process has worked before.From Paul Kane: \"There are just two precedents for such actions in the past 100 years, under the presidencies of Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. One resulted in Nixon resigning, forced out by senior congressional Republicans who warned they would vote to remove him. The other resulted in a 50-50 Senate vote, well short of the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution to convict and remove Clinton from office. The Clinton impeachment moved at warp speed; the Nixon proceedings crawled along for many months. ... Pelosi has for months explained her opposition to impeachment and asserted that Trump is baiting Democrats into a Clinton-style impeachment on party lines, in a bid to boost his reelection chances. This week, again trying to hold back impeachment forces, she tried to at least steer those Democrats toward a process more closely resembling Nixon's implosion.\"</p><p>             -- Three pieces published yesterday -\u00a0from Ronald Brownstein for the Atlantic, Kyle Kondik for the University of Virginia's Crystal Ball\u00a0and Walter Shapiro for the New Republic -\u00a0make the argument that Republicans did not pay as high of a price for Clinton's impeachment in the 1998 elections as conventional wisdom suggests. Kondik writes: \"The conventional wisdom about 1998 is that the Republicans were on track for big gains, but their pursuit of impeachment prevented them from realizing them. ... Perhaps in the absence of impeachment, the GOP would've won the majority of the closer races and could've netted seats instead of losing a small number. But even without impeachment they may not have performed way better than they otherwise did given Clinton's high approval and conditions of relative peace and prosperity.\"</p><p>             THE IMMIGRATION WARS:          </p><p>             -- The House now appears certain to hold Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt\u00a0over their refusal to turn over documents that could establish a discriminatory intent behind adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. \"The Justice Department said that certain documents the Democrats subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be released,\" Colby Itkowitz reports. House Oversight Chairman Elijah \"Cummings had given the agency until 5 p.m. Thursday to produce them or he would schedule a vote to hold Barr in contempt. The Commerce Department later said that it was also rejecting the committee's demands and accused the committee of 'playing politics.'\"</p><p>             -- A new study shows that the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Census could lead to an undercount of 6 million Hispanics nationwide, including nearly 5\u00a0percent of the total populations of California and Arizona.Ted Melinik and Kate Rabinowitz report: \"'It's just a really simple experiment where individuals are receiving a census form that looks remarkably similar to what people actually receive in 2020,' said Bryce Dietrich, a Shorenstein research fellow. 'And half the time that form includes a question about household members' citizenship, and in the other half of the time the question is not present.' ... A significant Hispanic undercount would change how many congressional seats go to some states, starting with the 2022 elections. California, with a projected Hispanic undercount of 1.8 million people, would lose two of its 53 House seats under this scenario. Texas, with an undercount of 1.1 million, would gain one rather than two seats from its overall population growth. The undercount would erase Arizona's projected gain of one seat. On the other hand, Montana could gain a second congressional seat, and three states could avoid losing a seat: Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio.\"</p><p>             -- The files found on the hard drives belonging to deceased Republican strategist Thomas Hofeller detail GOP gerrymandering in North Carolina.The Times's Michael Wines reports: \"The advocacy group Common Cause said in court documents submitted in Raleigh on Thursday that the Hofeller files include new evidence showing how North Carolina Republicans misled a federal court to prolong the life of their map of state legislative districts, which had been ruled unconstitutional. The Republicans told the federal court hearing the map case that they would not be able to draw new legislative districts and hold public hearings on them in time for a proposed special election in late 2017 or early 2018. In fact, Common Cause said, Mr. Hofeller's files show that almost all the work had already been done.\"</p><p>             -- The U.S. opened a new mass facility in Texas to hold migrant children.The AP's Garance Burke reports: \"The new emergency facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas, will hold as many as 1,600 teens in a complex that once housed oil field workers on government-leased land near the border, said Mark Weber, a spokesman for Office of Refugee Resettlement.

'I don't actually believe the threat has diminished,' McKenzie said after holding a series of meetings with the Iraqi prime minister and defense chief. 'I believe the threat is still very real.' McKenzie said he was 'heartened' by the efforts of the Iraqi government to protect American forces and its allies in the region. Roadside bombs have posed the major danger to American forces in Iraq, McKenzie added, but he said the threat from the Iranians is evolving.\"</p><p>             -- The U.S. spent two weeks on edge over Iran boats ferrying missiles around the Persian Gulf.The Wall Street Journal's Dion Nissenbaum reports: \"American surveillance kept constant watch on the two vessels after U.S. officials said they saw Iranian forces load missiles into launchers on their decks, according to U.S. officials. As tensions climbed, the Iranian ships eventually pulled into a harbor and unloaded the missiles that had set off alarms for the U.S. military. This protracted face-off in the Gulf, details of which haven't been reported, was the catalyst for a cascade of steps by the Trump administration that have fueled concerns of an armed clash.\"</p><p>             -- Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said no additional officers will be disciplined over the deadly Niger attack that killed four American soldiers.

But Kim Jong Un experienced none of its privations and probably never saw the suffering of his fellow North Koreans in person.

In the kitchens, there were cakes and French pastries, smoked salmon and pate, and tropical fruits like mangos and melons.

In a soft voice, the doctor, George O'Neil, pleaded with the man to continue to the next stage: an implant of the drug naltrexone, a device that the physician himself had invented and that is an emerging facet of an impassioned debate over the best way to treat addiction. 'I don't win with everybody,'\u00a0the doctor said after the man had left. 'But I try.' Over almost two decades, Dr. O'Neil, 70, has implanted his device - which is unlicensed but legal in Australia - into thousands of people who have traveled to his nonprofit clinic in Subiaco, a suburb of Perth.

Tesla is standing out as a story stock for all the wrong reasons, with shares down more than 10 per cent pre-market after the vehicle maker was spurned by the S&amp;P 500\u2019s gatekeepers, who refused to grant TSLA entry to the prestigious index Friday afternoon (preferring instead to invite Etsy, Teradyne and Coty).    AUDET SLAMS DOOR ON ALTICE, ROGERS    Louis Audet has essentially told his telecom company\u2019s unsolicited suitors to take a hike. \u201cOur shares are not for sale. And let me be clear, our refusal is not a negotiating position, it is definitive,\u201d he said in a release yesterday afternoon, a couple days after the $10.3-billion takeover approach was initially rejected by Cogeco\u2019s boards and the controlling Audet family. A spokesperson for Altice USA pointed us to the company\u2019s Sept. 3 statement about standing by its offer. We\u2019ll continue chasing perspective from minority Cogeco shareholders.    COVID-19 VACCINE MAKERS UNITE    The chief executives of nine leading drugmakers at the forefront of the global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine have banded together today in a pledge to not act in haste as the public \u2013 and the U.S. president \u2013 eagerly await a successful vaccine. In a statement that vows to act in accordance with \u201csound scientific principles\u201d, the CEOs say they will \u201conly submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA.\u201d    JOHN RUFFOLO PARALYZED    Prominent Canadian tech investor John Ruffolo is paralyzed from the waist down after a serious cycling accident last week. His wife describes him as \u201calert, communicating and fully aware\u201d of the situation. And in a LinkedIn post, John said he \u201cwill be back in full force as soon as humanly possible.\u201d Jon Erlichman has been in touch with the team that Ruffolo partnered with to launch a new private equity fund; we\u2019re looking forward to hearing directly from one of those partners shortly after 9am.    OTHER NOTABLE STORIES    -Aurora Cannabis today appointed Miguel Martin as its new CEO. Martin joined the pot producer in July, after previously serving as CEO of CBD specialist Reliva.

The revision is partly due to an accelerated maintenance schedule at Suncor's Firebag operations.    -Walt Disney Co. shares are inching higher this morning as investors take stock of the opening weekend for Mulan on Disney+.

It is a source of meaning. Controlling the meaning and the means to create more meaning is the secret of wealth and power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a blog post, Alfie Kohn, a prominent educational thinker and enemy of recent bureaucratic reforms, offers the following \"rule of thumb\" to apply to professionals in the field of education: \"An individual's enthusiasm about the employment of 'data' in education is directly proportional to his or her distance from actual students.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is today's double 3D definition:</p><p>Data:</p><p>Everything that has first been named and selected by technocrats before being ruthlessly catalogued, categorized, tagged, pigeonholed and otherwise separated from all living things</p><p>Big Data:</p><p>Massive miscellaneous data that has been gathered and rolled into semantic balls of various dimensions for the sporting pleasure of technocrats</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contextual note</emphasis></h><p>Kohn cites Christian Rudder who describes the problem of big data as being \"the calculated decision to stop being human\" by those who create and manage the data. Rudder claims that big data is neutral, since it is simply information people can work with any way they want. But that's no more than an artful dodge, as Kohn infers.</p><p>The question we need to ask is this: Why would those who control big data make the \"decision to stop being human\"? Because that is exactly what is happening in the institutions that use it for profit. And the simple answer may be that the economic system the data serves prefers data to anything that's human. Humans are costly and unreliable. They take vacations and complain about work conditions. Human teachers are no exception and, therefore, policymakers and administrators are easily tempted to shift more and more decision-making and teaching responsibility to data and, as it emerges, artificial intelligence.</p><p>It makes sense from a business point of view. No doubt both Arne Duncan, Barack Obama's head of education, and Betsy DeVos, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>current education secretary, would agree. But should questions about education always be approached from a business point of view? Should anything that involves human relations be subjected to pure business logic? Now that the ideology of neoliberalism has become every \"responsible\" decision-maker's ethical standard, they would all answer: yes.</p><p>\"Predictive analytics allows administrators to believe they're keeping a watchful eye on their charges when in fact they're learning nothing about each student's experience of college, his or her needs, fears, hopes, beliefs, and state of mind,\" Kohn says. The trend has existed for a long time, long before any digital data could be collected and analyzed. The system of analysis itself contains an essential item: willful neglect of the social dimension of learning. A \"student's experience\" consists of relationships: with teachers, other learners, friends outside the context of school and \"role models\" in the community (and increasingly in the media).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Historical note</emphasis></h><p>Tim Berners-Lee gave us the World Wide Web nearly 30 years ago. He literally offered it to the world, bucking the trend to exploit technology as a proprietary monopoly to accumulate wealth and power. Today, he complains about how major corporate interests, the big tech companies, have taken over and literally monopolized his open, democratic invention. He warns: \"These online gatekeepers can lock in their power by acquiring smaller rivals, buying up new innovations and hiring the industry's top talent, making it harder for others to compete.\"</p><p>They create and own mountains of data, including everything that is useful for them to know about their customers, meaning the rest of the world. And they monetize it, which may seem normal, but in so doing they create a class they themselves belong to: those who have the power to manipulate uncounted numbers of people through access to whatever meaning they attribute to the data.

It's also going to have to be much more relaxed about letting people opt out of how their data is used. That is possibly going to lead to it becoming a slightly smaller platform in terms of it being attractive for advertisers. The hashtag delete Facebook has that garnered much support? I have deleted mine! So many people have seen it and then said, I haven't done that. We haven't seen that massive footfall. It had about 10,000 retweets which is quite a lot. But we haven't seen the footfall in the millions. You may see people, like me, looking at the terms and conditions, and perhaps resetting what you put on your Facebook account. Yes.

Has our democracy been compromised by this, Trevor? Personally I do not think so. Politicians of all stamps have used the latest methods to try to persuade people to try and frame issues in a particular way. I don't think that is the big issue here. I think Mark Zuckerberg, not personally worried, frankly, he is only down to his last 68 billion after this week. Poor guy. What he is more worried about is that big tech starts to look like the big banks did seven, eight years ago. A couple of things will happen. Facebook is not going to get deleted. A British group of advertisers have threatened to stop using the platform. I don't think that will happen. Most people will do what you did, look at it and go, why bother? What he is more worried about, I think it is this... If there is a mood for greater public regulation what is they will do is bound up the lawmakers on surface regulations. I think Facebook would be really worried if law changed to put the value of that data in the consumers' hands. Isn't that what could happen? We would be in charge of how we allow -- who we allow to see our data. It is conceivable. But it will define ways of heading that off at the pass. Because that would really change things dramatically. If we had the value... In the way we do with our store cards. Loyalty cards. Yes, if Facebook were in that situation they would have to change their business model completely. That's why I think you have this announcement yesterday. To return to politics and democracy. Cambridge analytica, the story that has been exposed this week, how difficult is it for government who may have used their services in terms of political campaigns, and digging dirt on opponents? My view about this is that the genie is out of the bottle. Frankly, there is a lot of focus on Cambridge Analytical. They have done something at least unethical, if not unlawful, in the way the data has been used. The truth of the matter is nobody objected to it when Blue State Digital did something very similar to the Obama campaign. But we have these new tools. One of the difficulties we have in politics is that lawmakers are really, totally ill-equipped to deal with this. Most members of Parliament don't really understand it. I looked it up this morning. There are fewer than 30 members of Parliament, out of 650, who have a science background. One of the big problems is that the political sphere doesn't understand it. And the lawyers, who dominate parliament, think the way you solve this is to pass a law. They will get hammered.

Cambridge analytica, the story that has been exposed this week, how difficult is it for government who may have used their services in terms of political campaigns, and digging dirt on opponents? My view about this is that the genie is out of the bottle. Frankly, there is a lot of focus on Cambridge Analytical. They have done something at least unethical, if not unlawful, in the way the data has been used. The truth of the matter is nobody objected to it when Blue State Digital did something very similar to the Obama campaign. But we have these new tools. One of the difficulties we have in politics is that lawmakers are really, totally ill-equipped to deal with this. Most members of Parliament don't really understand it. I looked it up this morning. There are fewer than 30 members of Parliament, out of 650, who have a science background. One of the big problems is that the political sphere doesn't understand it. And the lawyers, who dominate parliament, think the way you solve this is to pass a law. They will get hammered. All right, all of those lawyers in the House of</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC2WA-d645a29d8df54cf99c8899abc7bf038b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC2WA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXP-4N71-DY08-32RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

In less than two years, acquisition operations valued at more than $100 billion (90,090 million euros) have been announced. Mastercard has bought The Danish Nets, an instant payment platform, for $3.2 billion. PayPal paid $2.2 billion for iZettle and Ant Financial has disbursed $700 million by Worldfirst to enter the European payments market.</p><p><br/>\"The payments business has increased in value by five in the last ten years. It is a very profitable and high growth activity. There are many payment companies that are worth more on the stock exchange than the banks themselves,\" carlos Trascasa, McKinsey's global head of Financial Services and Payments practice, says in an interview with EXPANSION Carlos Trascasa. Trascasa (Madrid, 1962) combines this function with the management of the Spanish office and the Public Sector area in Spain and Portugal.<br/>Margin<br/>In Spain, no such operations have been seen, but the activity of payments has made a remarkable leap in the revenue base of the banks. Now, this business accounts for about 40% of the income statement. \"With low interest rates other activities have declined,\" he says. \"This is an activity that generates more margin than the distribution of investment funds,\" he says.<br/>And you can still squeeze more, in your opinion. \"Overall, this activity has been mismanaged in Spain, because many services have been given for free and it is difficult to explain to customers that a good payment infrastructure comes at a cost,\" he says.<br/>The technological disruption in this business has been exponential in recent months. More than 40% of the fintech operating in the world do so in the payments segment. One of the most popular is TransferWise, which offers international transfers at very tight prices.<br/>Despite this reality, Trascasa removes iron from the real threat posed by small financial services technology companies to the banking business. \"The damage fintech does to Spanish banks, which are super-competitive, is zero. What tears them apart is the ECB's capital requirements and monetary policy,\" he says. \"The gluing capacity of a Spanish bank is enormous. If I wanted to, I could take a fintech off the market in a morning,\" he adds.<br/>The new European payments directive PSD2, which has been enforceable since 1 January 2021, has been a turning point, according to McKinsey. Back-in is critical of this regulation. \"We've never seen such direct and asymmetrical intervention of a market,\" he says. However, it believes that it will serve to awaken banks and exploit their greatest competitive advantage: reliability and security in data management. \"No one is going to give their financial information to four kids who have set up an app in a garage, but it's going to force banks to provide higher value-added services,\" he explains. \"I mean, it's not going to pit banks to face fintech, it's going to increase competition between the banks themselves,\" he adds.<br/>Convenience ratio<br/>Trascasa argues that small tech companies have more to gain if they partner with banking than the other way around. \"Fintech suffers to attract customers and costs them very high. They have no choice but to collaborate with the banks, which know how to do it very well. Bankers, for their part, also want to bond to keep up with new products,\" he explains. \"Banks are digitizing because the future is going through there, not the impact of tech companies,\" he adds.<br/>As for the battle thatdigital giants, Trascasa is clear. \"Big tech is going to take a while to get into the banking business because it's ruinous, but it's in the payments business, because it offers profitability, high growth and has a high technological component,\" he says. A few weeks ago, Apple released a credit card in the United States in collaboration with Goldman Sachs. \"Apple Card offers nothing differential. It's designed for people who like branding,\" he explains.<br/>According to McKinsey, the three major Spanish banks - Santander, BBVA and CaixaBank - have nothing to envy Americans about innovation. \"They don't go after anyone in the world. On the contrary. They've given him the right money at the right time.\" \"Too much investment isn't good either,\" he adds.<br/>The Libra cryptocurrency<br/>Tracasa is convinced that Libra, Facebook's cryptocurrency, is going to take \"quite a few years\" to get going. \"This is an example that technology allows things that regulation has not yet foreseen,\" he explains. In his opinion, the digital giant has sinned of naivety. \"He has proved unaware of Libra's profound structural implications on financial traffic security and on the capitalist economy itself. This is not that Libra can take business away from banks, but affects something that only moves every 100 or 150 years,\" he explains. In addition, Facebook has exposed its letters. \"All your competitors will develop similar things now that they know their plans,\" he says.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9317459</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFB-B851-JBJN-M459-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

We have spoken to a lot of them on this program, but recent revelations about how a third party, Cambridge Analytica, allegedly exploited the data of 50 million Facebook users[1] has really brought this debate into the mainstream. Rana has been writing about these threats for a long time in her column in Financial Times (FT)[2]. She is also the author, by the way, of the award-winning book Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business[3], and we're going to get into Makers and Takers and what that means in this conversation as well. She is also CNN's global economic analyst. Rana, thank you so much for joining us. RANA FOROOHAR: Thanks for having me. STEPHANIE SY: Let's just hop right into the Facebook issue. On the one hand, I think when this story broke I was grateful at the amount of data that Facebook has, how it uses it, and how third parties are involved was being exposed because it had long been suspected. Now it seems to have brought the debate into the mainstream. On the other hand, I think a lot of people are saying, \"Wow.\" RANA FOROOHAR: \"What's going on?\" STEPHANIE SY: \"How do I untangle myself from something I have become completely addicted to?\" RANA FOROOHAR: It's interesting. I think of the challenges facing not just Facebook but big tech in general. If you look at the top five tech companies, the FAANGs, as they are known\u2014Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google\u2014all of them in recent days have taken major share price hits. There are big concerns about regulation. There are big concerns about what the future growth trajectory of these firms is. That, by the way, just as a side note, has a huge effect on the markets and the economy in general because tech has led the markets for the last two years. This \"asset bubble\" perhaps that has been created has had a real effect on the economy. But coming back to what all this means, I think of it in three ways. I think that the big tech companies are facing economic crisis, political crisis, and cognitive crisis. We are starting with the political. We're starting with this revelation that there was leaked data from Facebook users, that it played a part in election manipulating[4] and possibly the election[5] of Donald Trump[6] in November of 2016. There are also other political issues here about lobbying, about the way in which these companies have asserted their economic power. The largest lobbying bloc in Washington now, which is really interesting\u2014my previous book covered the financial industry, and in some ways these tech firms have become the new systemically important institutions. STEPHANIE SY: That's why we call it \"big\" tech. RANA FOROOHAR: That's why it's called big tech. STEPHANIE SY: You get the \"big\" moniker when you have lobbying power, and they have more than big pharma at this point. RANA FOROOHAR: That's right, and they're using it, I can tell you. That is something that I think viewers should think about because we are seeing and we are going to hear a lot in the next few weeks and months about \"Big tech's going to get regulated, there's going to be a pushback.\" Well, that's complicated. Yes, there already is a pushback in certain ways, but it is not at all clear that there is going to be regulation that will really curb the power of these companies, and I think that we're facing a similar situation that we did in 2008, where you've got an industry that is so big, so complex, and touches every single person almost in the world really that checking it, reining it in, and creating an ecosystem that really enriches everyone is going to be a process. STEPHANIE SY: So, 2008, obviously you're talking about the financial crisis[7], \"too big to fail[8],\" the power of Wall Street. Makers and Takers is very much about how the markets and the way these financial institutions began working was not about creating and investing in jobs and job training and things that would help grow the economy, it was more just to enrich themselves with smoke and mirrors that led to the financial crisis. Let's dig a little deeper into your analogy here. How do you see that comparing with these big tech companies? RANA FOROOHAR: I see a lot of parallels. It is interesting because the first chapter in my book\u2014I was looking for the most Kafkaesque[9] example of how the financial markets were being used or misused, and the example that I came up with was Apple. Of all the FAANGs, it has probably had the least bad press in recent weeks, but it's actually at the heart of the economic problems associated with big tech in the sense that these firms get most of their value from intellectual property (IP) and from data, Apple not so much data but certainly intellectual property. These things are very easy to offshore. It's just like capital; globalization favors capital over labor. Companies can move money, move people wherever they like, but individuals living in nation-states on the ground don't have those opportunities. If you look at the amount of money that has been offshored not just by Apple but by Google, Qualcomm, any number of other large tech firms, it's about $1 trillion in the last decade. Actually, it's interesting. During the financial crisis, the financial sector tanked for a while and had to rein in risk, rein in leverage. Big tech was unleashed. So these companies were actually making a lot of money. About $1 trillion of it is offshore. At the same time, they are issuing debt on the U.S. public markets at very low interest rates, using that to pay back the wealthiest shareholders, the Carl Icahns[10] of the world, and this seems very unfair to a lot of people who say, \"Hey, these companies actually got rich in part because of government-funded research, and what are they monetizing?\" Again, Apple is in a somewhat separate category. It sells products. Google sells products as well\u2014the Android phone\u2014but a lot of what these companies are monetizing is us, it's data. STEPHANIE SY: Our data. So that brings us back to the Facebook story, and I really want to get your take\u2014we'll get into regulation, so let's leave that aside and get into what makes sense there\u2014on that for a minute. I think people are aware that that's how ads are targeted on Facebook, that they use your data, and we willingly still log on and share our most intimate life moments because Facebook has this sort of brilliant psychological business plan where they play on our psychology and our narcissism and all sorts of other things. RANA FOROOHAR: That's right. STEPHANIE SY: But where does it go from here?Is there a moment for Facebook now where it has to change its business model?Is that what we're talking about? RANA FOROOHAR: I think so. I think there are a few different issues: First, you're right. The targeted-advertising business model is really problematic. Yes, we are willingly logging on; yes, we are giving our data. Although if you look at it\u2014and some of this stuff is changing in real time\u2014it used to be that there were very few caveats, very few visible buy-in options. You'd have a hard time using the product unless you gave your data. Now you are starting to see warnings, you are starting to see more of an opt-in sort of situation. I think we are going to much more toward that where there is a lot of transparency: You log in, maybe you get a waiver the same way you do when you see a drug advertisement on television, you hear about all the side effects at the same time that you're hearing about what it can do. The other thing I think we're going to see a lot of pressure around is the transparency of how these companies value data. One of the things that is really interesting to me as someone who covers economics is these products and services aren't free. We think they're free, but we're paying with our data, but we don't know how much that data is worth. That actually upends the economic laws of gravity, because if you think about how market capitalism works\u2014Adam Smith[11], the father of market capitalism, would say that you need three things in order for markets to work: You need equal access to data; you need transparency within a transaction, you and I need to understand what is being bought and sold here; and you need, and this is particularly relevant for Carnegie, a \"shared moral framework.\" I would argue that none of those three things are in play\u2014 STEPHANIE SY: Exist in our relationship with Facebook. RANA FOROOHAR: That's right, and I think that we're going to see a lot of pressure for these firms to be incredibly transparent about what are we giving up, what is the value of this information. Interestingly, there are also some new business models that are springing up. The founder[12] of Mozilla, the open-source search engine, has actually come up with a new search engine[13] where users can pay a fee and get total ad blocking, meaning there is no targeting, no ads, or if they do want targeted ads because some people actually want\u2014I like buying nice handbags, I get the new ad for a nice handbag\u2014you can actually be very specific about who you want and how, and they will pay you to receive advertising. That is just one interesting new business model, and I think there is going to be a lot more change in that direction. STEPHANIE SY: It seems clear that Facebook is looking at all of this, how to give users more control over what data they're sharing and if they do want the targeted purse ads, then they'll get that, and if they don't, maybe they will come up with a model where you can opt out entirely. I think there is a trust issue there. RANA FOROOHAR: Absolutely. STEPHANIE SY: I think users knew that their data was being used. The transparency and the lack of transparency that came with third-party use or purchase of that data, that wasn't surprising I think to a lot of people who were already cynical about how their data was used\u20141984[14]\u2014but I think it probably was surprising to a lot of Facebook users. RANA FOROOHAR: I think that's right. STEPHANIE SY: Let's talk about regulation versus self-regulation. It seems like Mark Zuckerberg[15] is already making moves before any regulations hit the books. Is that going to be enough, or should we look toward the European model? On May 25 of this year there will be new regulations[16] that will come into effect that will restrict the type of personal data tech companies can collect, store, and use across the European Union (EU), and of course one of the rules that will be enshrined is the right to be forgotten[17]. Is that an approach that the United States needs to be looking at at this point? RANA FOROOHAR: I think so. There are a few interesting things there. First of all, this right to be forgotten, Europe is giving people the right to just have their entire data trail, the \"cookies\" that follow you around, erased and permanently forgotten, and 2 million people have actually already opted into that. So this is not a small thing. I see a couple of things happening on the regulatory front. I think the United States, Europe, and China seem to be going in very different directions. We have had two models of big tech so far: The United States, which owns most of the world, has been extremely laissez-faire[18]. Tech firms have been very lightly regulated. In fact, one of the core principles that tech firms have lobbied for over the past few years, was an exemption granted under the Communications Decency Act (CDA)[19] in 1996 in which tech firms were considered to be the \"town square,\" so whatever you did in the town square was not their liability. That is very different from a media firm like the FT, for example, or even a non-profit, where you are responsible to a certain extent for what happens in this office, in our pages at the FT. The tech firms have lobbied very carefully to keep that light-touch regulation. Now you are starting to see that rolling back. There was a law that actually passed just a couple of weeks ago through the Senate that provided a small carve-out in CDA Section 230[20], this loophole, for sex trafficking. This came up because of the really horrible case of Backpage.com,[21] which was engaging with a website that was engaging in child sex trafficking, and there was a push to say: \"Hey, if you are doing sex trafficking on your website or you are engaging in any way and have knowledge of this and are supporting this in the online ecosystem, then guess what?You are liable.\" That may open the door to a lot more regulation. So that's what's happening in the United States. China has a different system. China has a state-run system obviously, so there is regulation, but there is also total unlimited data collection. So there are smart cities in China where people are monitored 24/7, in their homes, in their cars. That is important in this conversation because artificial intelligence (AI), the technology of the future that all of these firms and really almost every industry, is counting on for growth, is built on two things: It's built on data, and it's built on quantum computing. So China is saying: \"We're going to collect as much data as possible. That's going to help us move ahead in this industry.\" Europe\u2014to come back to your initial question\u2014is saying: \"Wait a minute. We want to find a middle ground here. We are social democrats, largely. We care about human rights and privacy, but we also don't want to move behind in tech.\" So they're trying to find a way to protect citizens' privacy and yet also not lose out in the industries of the future. STEPHANIE SY: There is so much to unpack in what you just said. Let's just start with China. Vacuuming up all of that data, is the central government doing that as well? My understanding is that it is the central government that's doing that, but it's also Tencent and some of the large Chinese tech companies that know they can benefit from data in the same way that Facebook and Google are benefiting. RANA FOROOHAR: Absolutely. China has its BATs\u2014Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent\u2014like the FAANGs in the United States. These firms are doing just as much if not more. There is more mobile commerce in China, and in some ways the Chinese are more data-savvy and more willing to engage in the digital ecosystem. But all of these firms have relationships with the state, and this is an important point actually in the trade debate that you have going on right now and the Trump administration[22] slapping tariffs[23] on China around tech. The Chinese tech ecosystem is a strategic sector for China. Any company that wants to work in this sector is going to have dealings with the government, and you can bet that the data is being shared. STEPHANIE SY: What is interesting about China is that they are also\u2014I am going to get back to ethics for a minute\u2014coming out with this \"social credit[24]\" score. The idea is that they are using people's online activities and the data that they're sharing in all the different ways that are connected via technology to basically score citizens on their morality and determine whether they\u2014Orwellian[25], right?What is interesting is that the question is, is reading someone's credit based on ethics ethical? RANA FOROOHAR: It's such a great question, and you're opening up literally the black box now of algorithms, which is a whole other\u2014 STEPHANIE SY: We don't have to dwell too long on this, but it's interesting how data is being used in ways that on the one hand might gain a competitive edge but is also a huge surveillance tool. RANA FOROOHAR: It's a great question. The fact is it goes both ways. What you're talking about could be an opportunity\u2014if we look on the bright side for just one moment\u2014for a rural person who might not have access to credit to say, \"I can gain access to credit because we're going to use different metrics than have been used in the past.\" That is happening in the United States. There are a number of think tanks in Washington, for example, that are looking at how could big data and algorithms be used in a way that would be inclusive, how can we make sure that low-income people, people of color, who typically have lower credit rating scores based on traditional metrics, we can now use a whole bunch of other data points in order to get access. But those algorithms can be racist, those algorithms can be used for government surveillance. It is very easy in China and very worrisome to think about how\u2014what does it mean to get a bad morality score?Do you have to go to jail? I think these things are very worrisome, and that is why transparency is huge. It is about trust. STEPHANIE SY: Let's dig into that a little bit, the idea that AI is programmed by humans, and humans are deeply flawed and racist and discriminatory, and AI ideally makes for better productivity, better efficiencies. That is the plus side of AI. On the other hand, I have been hearing a lot of buzz about is AI sexist and racist. With such a lack of transparency\u2014again, it goes back to whose responsibility is it to figure out how companies are utilizing AI, for example, in hiring practices, how police departments might eventually use it in criminal justice, or family services might use it to determine whether somebody deserves to keep their child. There are so many applications that I am hearing about with AI. RANA FOROOHAR: It's interesting. You're reminding me of a really terrific book written by a friend of mine, Cathy O'Neil[26], called Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy[27], and she gets into algo-racism and all the examples you're talking about. Her take is that you need both the public and the private sectors to be involved in this. If you look at what, let's say, a company like IBM is doing. They have actually come out with kind of an AI bill of rights, a data bill of rights, real transparency, very easy, very clear to understand: This is how your data is going to be used. You will own the data. We will own some of the insights, the customer can also have some insights in these particular ways. So it is a lot more transparent, and they are actually using data as a competitive tool around privacy. But I do think that this is the sort of area that is going to require government oversight. One thing that Europe is actually looking at right now is the idea of data trusts. You know that there are health trusts like the Wellcome Trust[28] or the Icelandic genomic bank[29], where in this case biological or health data is kept in a place where there is a public oversight of that. There is trust built into the system. A private company cannot simply hold and own this data and do whatever they want with it. There is a discussion now about could we find a middle ground, could Europe find a middle ground, where yes, there could be citizens' data that would be held and used for specific purposes to increase efficiency in health services, to help avoid tax evasion, to create digital identities that could help people to get access to social services, and yet that would be protected, that would be ring-fenced. There is also another area we might want to talk about, how individuals could use technology to own and monetize their own data. STEPHANIE SY: I'm hearing that that is happening in Europe. I am hearing that already there are companies trying to capitalize off these new regulations by figuring out once we have valued what your personal data is worth, what if you decide I do want to sell it? RANA FOROOHAR: I don't know if you've heard about blockchain[30]. It gets associated with Bitcoin[31], which is I think a kind of bubble cryptocurrency and has a nefarious reputation, but blockchain itself is just a technology that decentralizes data that might otherwise be held in hubs. If you think about what Google or Facebook do in order to offer that incredibly profitable targeted advertising, they take data from large pools of people. They then hold it in a kind of a basket, in a centralized server, and then they decide that, \"Well, you seem like this other group of customers,\" and then they sell that grouping to advertisers who can then blast out information. STEPHANIE SY: But it's a public ledger. Is that important? RANA FOROOHAR: It is a public ledger, although the algorithms are not transparent, and the companies are very reluctant to say exactly how this targeting is working. But what we do know is that there is a grouping of data. That is why when you get an advertisement it may not be exactly what you want, it's not perfect for you, it's kind of an idea about who you are. If you have a blockchain system where, say, a digital identity, me, Rana Foroohar, all the thoughts I've ever had, my book, my FT columns, lives in this digital identity known as Rana Foroohar, and I can own that almost like a contract, and theoretically, not yet in practice, I could monetize myself. I could say to a publisher, \"Yes, you can take the rights for my book in this particular way,\" and that would be secure. It would cut out a lot of intermediaries, and it's something that is already affecting, say, the financial industry, which makes a lot of money intermediating between transactions. STEPHANIE SY: Wouldn't that represent an existential threat to a company like Facebook?It would take the value of the data and put it back into the hands of the users. RANA FOROOHAR: Yes, and that may be\u2014to circle back around to one of your very first questions, how is the business model changing?A lot of people feel that the business model should not be about monetizing your data and keeping you online as long as possible, sometimes doing stupid stuff, like watching cat videos, or maybe not stupid, but wasting a lot of time online in order to monetize more data. Let's make the business model about providing something that you need\u2014information, a service\u2014quickly and efficiently. Let's let these firms compete online, perhaps in online auctions, for the right to provide you with that service. That might be a new business model. STEPHANIE SY: I want to get back to a couple of themes you brought up earlier. You basically have written about these big tech companies as monopolies. RANA FOROOHAR: Yes. STEPHANIE SY: Why is it important to see them that way? RANA FOROOHAR: When I joined the FT my mandate was basically to write about the world's most important business issues, and I always follow the money. So the very first thing I did was to look at where is the money going, and I came across a really interesting McKinsey Global Institute survey looking at how about 80 percent of corporate wealth now lives in roughly 10 percent of firms, and those are the very IP- and data-rich firms, the biggest of which are the FAANGs. I started looking at that sector, and the more I looked, the more I thought: Oh, my goodness. All of the trends we've seen in the last 40 years\u2014increasing inequality, job depression, wage stagnation\u2014are going to be put on rocket fuel with these firms because technology speeds up all the problems of globalization. All the discontents of neoliberalism that favors companies and capital more than labor gets sped up exponentially because these tech firms create a tremendous amount of wealth but not that many jobs. STEPHANIE SY: In your Makers and Takers dichotomy, these are takers. RANA FOROOHAR: All too often, yes. Certainly they have created some great innovations. I will caveat that by saying much of the basis of those innovations\u2014the Internet, Global Positioning System (GPS), touchscreen\u2014 STEPHANIE SY: Government research. RANA FOROOHAR: Government research. So yes, they're innovators, but they're also data monetizers. The other reason that I got interested in this topic is I started hearing from people from all walks of life\u2014biotech, small software companies, midsized chip suppliers\u2014saying: \"You know what?We're getting squashed by the biggest tech firms.\" I started looking at why that is, and if you think about what these firms are all about, they make products that include 10,000, 20,000 bits of IP. They would like to pay as little as possible for that, so they want to squeeze their supply chains, and then they monetize data, and that doesn't really require anything except you and me. So they're not really contributing in the same way to the innovation ecosystem as some companies of the past might have done. I think that is going to require an incredible rethink of policy on everything from anti-trust to patents to privacy to civil liberties. We're talking about an Industrial Revolution[32]-type change in what the regulatory framework should look like. STEPHANIE SY: Do you think the United States is way behind when it comes to making policies to control the outsized political and economic influence of big tech? RANA FOROOHAR: I do. There are a number of people who are pushing on this issue. Look at anti-trust, for example. We had a big shift in this country in the 1980s. Robert Bork[33], the federal judge, had a new idea that was put forward and adopted during the Reagan era[34]: \"Well, as long as companies are lowering consumer prices, everything is good. They can get as big as they want to get.\" But is pricing the only measure of welfare?Forget about tech, you can look at a firm like Walmart, for example, and say: \"Well, they've lowered prices, but they've also put a lot of Main Street firms out of business. They've also offshored a lot of production and crunched the supply chain.\" Amazon is now putting pressure on Walmart. Amazon takes these trends to the next level. I think that we need to start thinking about: One, what is the transaction here?It's not about price because we're getting things that are free, although as I said we're paying for them in other ways. But also, what is a broader definition of welfare?Can we think about how a company is enriching the overall economic ecosystem? People say: \"Well, that's too mushy, that's too complicated. Pricing is really discrete and easy to factor.\" But there are already institutions that work under a broader mandate. The Federal Reserve Bank has a mandate to support community economic development in the cities where it works, so does the Boston Fed, the Chicago Fed, the San Francisco Fed. STEPHANIE SY: I wasn't aware of that part of the mandate. You hear about inflation. RANA FOROOHAR: They do have that dual mandate, but another part under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act[35], the Fed was given the task of forwarding community development. So there are already institutions that do this. We need to think more creatively. STEPHANIE SY: Speaking of Amazon potentially being the new Walmart. Its stock today, March 29, was down 2 percent at the open because the president[36] tweeted[37] about Amazon, and he said: \"They pay little or no taxes to state and local government. They use our postal system as their delivery boy, and they are putting thousands of retailers out of business.\" The point I want to talk about a little bit is the effect of these big tech companies on workers. We can start with my question, which is: The top five companies in the world, all tech companies, don't employ as many workers as maybe a manufacturing company or even a Walmart frankly. RANA FOROOHAR: That's right. There was a very interesting research study that was done recently looking at this latest generation of tech firms, the Facebooks, Googles. They create fewer jobs than the previous generation of tech firms like Apple or Microsoft or IBM. Those firms created fewer than the previous generation of industrial giants, your General Motors (GM), your General Electrics. So there has been a trend of jobs going like this, but market cap continues to go like that. Getting to ethics in all this, that is great for the top 20 percent of the population that owns 80 percent of the stock assets in this country. All of our portfolios are going like this. Jobs, not so much. Here's the rub. I think this is going to become a huge political issue, not just in the midterm elections in 2018[38], but in 2020[39] because the disruption caused by these firms and caused not only by what we can see already in the consumer Internet but the coming revolution in the industrial Internet, the Internet of Things[40], AI, all of these things are going to disrupt jobs farther and farther up the white-collar food chain. Frankly you see certain amounts of journalism being done by robots, you see radiology reports being read by robots. This is a white-collar problem and a blue-collar problem, and that is going to create interesting new political alliances, I think. STEPHANIE SY: Having said that, the political lobbying power of Google in Washington, although great, ultimately do you think we are at a turning point with an understanding now in the mainstream of how a company like Facebook is impacting democracy, how a company like Amazon is impacting the labor force and small business?Is there a turning point here that you see happening?Is this that moment? RANA FOROOHAR: Is this a 2008 moment that we could actually capture and leverage in some way? STEPHANIE SY: Yes. RANA FOROOHAR: I think the jury is out, and here is where I think the big question marks are that you are seeing a push for regulation. A number of bills have been put forward in Congress, but a lot of them are either window dressing or at the margins. The other thing to remember is that we are going through a 100-year shift in our economy. This is Industrial Revolution-type stuff. Moving from an economy that is made up mostly of tangibles\u2014goods coming off an assembly line\u2014to an intangible economy of data and IP is going to require a much broader sea change in regulations. That needs to be done with a lot of smart people in the room working together. If you start to do it piecemeal, you actually may end up in the same situation that you did with Dodd-Frank[41], for example, the financial regulation, which, by the way, was turned into Swiss cheese in part because of the lobbying pressure from these firms. You had seven different regulatory bodies, a lot of firms piling in saying we want this or that loophole, and you ended up with a system that a lot of people on both the right and the left are not happy with. I think that is the risk now. I would love to see a stand-alone regulatory body for the digital economy. At least, we could start with a stand-alone executive committee to study what the framework should be for evaluation of intellectual property in the digital age: How can we make sure that the digital economy is inclusive?I think that a task force would be great. STEPHANIE SY: The questions have to be asked, and you hope at least that comes out of the morass we saw in last year's election, that the conversation begins. We have had a couple of[42] guests here[43] who have said that one of the things that should be looked at is a universal basic income (UBI), because it is a fact that these technologies, and AI in particular, has been pointed out over and over on this stage as being so disruptive that you are going to see at all levels, like you say, up to the white-collar level, people without work, there not being enough jobs. What do you think about that? RANA FOROOHAR: I have mixed feelings about UBI. I do think we are going to need a stronger social safety net, absolutely. We're going to go through a period of 10 years of big-time tech-based job disruption at all levels. People are going to need re-training, they're going to need government assistance in some cases during that process of transition. I'm not sure that UBI is the way to do that, and I'll tell you why. UBI doesn't address the meaning-of-work issue. Meaning is really important. There are a lot of economists who have studied\u2014if you don't have a job, you have higher rates of depression, you have communities literally fall apart. Look at Detroit. They can't keep the lights on. STEPHANIE SY: People want to work. RANA FOROOHAR: People want to work. UBI, handing someone a check, does not solve the problem. I must say that I'm a little concerned about the fact that a lot of the proponents of UBI tend to come out of Silicon Valley, and I feel like they see it as an easy way to make sure that the pitchforks don't come for them. STEPHANIE SY: Interesting. RANA FOROOHAR: I was at an event last year talking to an entrepreneur, a venture capitalist, who said: \"Well, you know, it's great. We're going to have so much wealth created by these tech firms. They're going to be able to hand everyone a check for $25,000 a year, and coal miners can just become, you know, software designers or surfers or writers.\" I thought: Oh, man. You haven't been to the Rust Belt. You don't know what it's like. Families are changing because a lot of people are out of work, and that kind of naivete is worrisome. STEPHANIE SY: I just want to end by talking about, we've titled this \"The Dangers of a Digital Democracy,\" and I think it does make sense to bring it back to what we've learned and the ways that our data may have been exploited in some ways to influence how we think. That is really hard for me to wrap my head around because if what you're talking about is in 2020 or 2018, we're going to start to see some of the impacts of what these disruptive technologies mean to voters\u2014there may be some job loss. That would start with the premise that democracy is intact. I think there is concern that the power of these companies goes beyond economic and that it goes deeply into our understanding of truth and fact, and how do you have a democracy when there are these alternative realities that are being accelerated through these \"town squares,\" as you call them? RANA FOROOHAR: I think you've hit on the core existential issue here. A few facts: More Americans than not now get the majority of their news from social media, from tech platforms. That has coincided with a loss of trust in liberal democracy. If you look at the latest Edelman Trust Barometer[44]\u2014the PR firm Edelman puts out a trust barometer every year\u2014the countries in which social media and platform tech usage is rising, countries like ours, you see a fall-off in trust in liberal democracy. Interestingly, you see rising trust in autocracies, like China or the United Arab Emirates (UAE). STEPHANIE SY: Which is so counterintuitive. You would think the more information you have access to\u2014 RANA FOROOHAR: That's right. But this goes to the dangers of the digital democracy. We don't want an autocracy, but how do we make sure that people are not living in silo bubbles?It is 70 percent more likely for fake news to be spread on Twitter than real news. That is a serious problem. Starting with transparency is super-important. Fortunately, I see a turn. It is well known that the president's election has really galvanized the news media, and the FT has seen its subscriptions go to record levels, so has The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post. I think that serious news is on the rebound. I think people realize that you may have to pay for content that is legitimate. But that brings up serious issues, too, that we're going to have to grapple with, because there is a digital divide in terms of who can pay for the FT, over $400 a year. STEPHANIE SY: Absolutely. There is even a digital divide when it comes to who has access to the Internet. RANA FOROOHAR: Exactly. STEPHANIE SY: The people who are most vulnerable to exploitation are those who are not necessarily going to pay to get past the FT paywall. RANA FOROOHAR: That is absolutely right, and you might start to see ways in which a digital tax of some kind could be used to support broader public access. Let's look back to what some of the titans of the past did, the Carnegies[45], the Rockefellers[46]. They started libraries, they started public services. I would love to hear how the tech giants as they go forward in their testimonies in the next few weeks and months are going to approach this issue. STEPHANIE SY: Rana Foroohar, thank you so much. RANA FOROOHAR: Thank you. STEPHANIE SY: Those are really interesting insights. Any one of those topics we could have gone on for another half-hour. RANA FOROOHAR: Another time. STEPHANIE SY: But I appreciate that you were able to hit every single ball out of the park that I pitched to you. RANA FOROOHAR: Thank you. STEPHANIE SY: It was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. RANA FOROOHAR: And you.

I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong.\"</p><p>It's feasible, given the way Facebook's algorithms can reportedly target advertising at users when they feel \"insecure\" and \"worthless\", that the company has somehow figured out how to censor only speech that is intentionally wrong. But even that low threshold seems to have been abandoned in Facebook's relentless quest for freedom of expression.</p><p>Elected politicians are allowed to speak freely on Facebook - which is to say, they're allowed to spend money to buy advertising - even when they and everybody else knows that the ads are wrong, intentionally or otherwise. Lies are an important part of the public discourse, Facebook argues, and by allowing politicians to spread them, it only serves to further democracy.</p><p>Last week, Twitter took a polar opposite stance and enraged the US President by banning political ads entirely. The civil rights activists and causes with which Zuckerberg associates himself also don't see things quite the same way. Martin Luther King's daughter, Bernice King, noted that it was political disinformation that \"created an atmosphere\" for her father's assassination.</p><p>\"Free speech\" isn't the only phrase Facebook has been bandying about in its self-defence against legislators and regulators, who are trying to ensure that events such as Cambridge Analytica and the Christchurch massacre live-streaming do not happen again.</p><p>Facebook executives, visiting Australia in an effort to shape the new regulatory framework that would seek to curb the excesses of Big Tech companies, routinely trot out the word \"innovation\" as something which, like free speech, should itself curb the excesses of any such regulation.</p><p>Facebook is all in favour of regulation as long as it doesn't stand in the way of innovation. The two terms, \"free speech\" and \"innovation\", have a lot in common. To start with, they're both in the same rhetorical family as the word \"motherhood\". After all, who can argue against free speech/innovation/motherhood, without coming off as a monster?</p><p>Moreover, neither free speech nor innovation are unalloyed goods. They both have a dark side, which Facebook is hoping legislators and regulators will discount when the time comes to draft and enforce new laws.</p><p>You don't have to turn to the wholesale destruction of forests, the pumping of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air or the disposal of plastic in the ocean - those singularly human innovations that scientists say have us in a new era of mass extinction - to question whether innovation always produces desirable outcomes.</p><p>You only have to look at Big Tech's recent innovations to see that some laws might be worth having, not because they don't get in the way of innovation, but precisely because they do.</p><p>Uber revolutionised the transport industry, to be sure, but arguably its most important innovation, the one that allowed it to offer rides cheaper than taxis, was that it found a way to use technology to bypass existing labour laws and pay its drivers less than the minimum wage.</p><p>Facebook's own innovations, of course, are well documented. But the role that social media played in mass killings in Sri Lanka and Myanmar; the hitherto unfeasible way Russia meddled with US elections; and the spectacle of a mass murderer live-streaming - these are all innovations the world could do without.</p><p>To be sure, innovation, like free speech, is part of the solution to the problems that regulators of Big Tech are only now seeking to address.</p><p>But like free speech, it's part of the problem, too. Not all innovation amounts to progress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc77trjrigc0x1fc7qchrv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDY-00D1-JD34-V4MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

If you have an iPhone, odds are you've seen your weekly screen time report. It pops up on Sunday mornings, cheerily informing you whether your screen time is up or down. Instagram threw around the idea of hiding the endorphin-inducing like count on photos, and it allows you to check how much time you've spent on the app. </p><p>Not content with the efforts of social media giants themselves, one Republican senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri, introduced a bill to ban features meant to be addictive and implement other curbs on Big Tech. </p><p>It's quite a predicament: The internet and our devices are indispensable, and we're trying to protect ourselves from our usage of them.

Looking back at it, Vinod Ganesan, Country Manager - India, Cloudera, outlines six key tech trends that will shape the technology in India in 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2018 was a year of fundamental change. Underpinning this was the impact of data management and analytics and of course GDPR. Commentary from Cloudera looks back over the year and looks at six key tech areas for 2019 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. IoT </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have created IoT solutions and edge networks that are far too gullible and trusting.</p><p>In 2019, security has to be the number one focus point for organisations to ensure the safety and efficacy of edge devices and networks accordingly. There are too many vulnerabilities and gaps in the security posture for IoT devices --  organisations must take a proactive approach to securing devices. Organizations must use the data, metadata, device logs - treating IoT devices like any other network device to predict and accurately respond to the available signals.</p><p>Context is the next major frontier in IoT.  </p><p>More data islands have been created with IoT, we are now starting to bridge the islands but we don't speak the same collective language. The ability to acquire data from disparate systems and align it on common ontologies so we can trust and utilize the data.  The clockspeed for decision-making is increasing, while information expands exponentially underneath our feet. As AI and machine learning evolve, allowing these capabilities to organize the data, attribute it from a universe of observations, and produce auto-didactic insights, will give us opportunities not yet imagined.  Lineage - \"what did we know and when did we know it\" will be a key capability that allows organizations to use data optimally. </p><p>Next year we will see further use cases of IoT in home spaces, smart cities and more industrial use cases in automation or autonomous vehicles. Technology ecosystems are forming so a holistic view of data across the cloud to the edge is important to maximise the benefit of the data used across these ecosystems. Cloudera can do that by making sense of the community and provide the value add and protect the data and the consumer by assuring governance and security. </p><p>2. GDPR</p><p>The fines associated with non-compliance of the regulation are significant: up to 4% of annual global turnover or $20 million, whichever is greatest. Even if an organisation would not flinch at those kinds of numbers, the impact on their reputation would certainly get them to care about complying. GDPR to a large extend is about showing your customers and employees you are careful with their data, that it is used for the right purpose and that, ultimately, they have control. With that control also comes trust. And any organisation care about that.</p><p>Companies made personally accountable for how they treat privacy and personal data</p><p>Yes, it is true companies are now personally accountable for GDPR regulated data across the complete data flow, including partners that they need to exchange information with. That also makes it crucial for smaller organisations, suppliers to larger ones, to achieve and maintain their GDPR compliance as it becomes a competitive differentiator.</p><p>Big fines ahead for big tech and companies that fail to have adequate security</p><p>Data security is but part of GDPR, though an important one: organisations now have the obligation to notify the regulator within 72h of a data breach being discovered. The complete post-breach process including informing the affected individuals is now well defined and following it part of compliance requirements. Under article 25, data protection must be implemented by design and by default; security forms a natural part.</p><p>The effects on cloud computing</p><p>The effect of cloud computing is such that for organisations, it is important to ensure that the cloud services they use are compliant and that the systems and applications they design do not expose risk. </p><p>Do you think GDPR will expand and become a global regulation in 2019?</p><p>Expanding GDPR to become a global regulation is a certainly a potential further evolution. Already Cloudera customers and organisations that would not be subject to the regulation are taking it as their starting point for their own personal data privacy and protection guidelines. For it to become a truly global regulation though, it will first need to prove its worth in its current form; once that has progressed well and has proven workable, the chances of it influencing international practice will be much higher.</p><p>What organisations subject to GDPR are already realising though is that May 2018 was not the end of the process, the complete opposite. Creating compliance is one thing, but living compliance at scale quite another. What's more, GDPR in its current form may and likely will also evolve further. Organisations that build a solid foundation now, will be able to maintain compliance with less effort as the regulation evolves.</p><p>3. Healthcare</p><p>80% of all healthcare data is unstructured and for clinicians, doctors, nurses and surgeons, an incredible amount of insight remains hidden away in troves of clinical notes, EHR data, medical images, and omics data to understand patient records better.  We are witnessing a revolution in the healthcare industry currently, in which there is now an opportunity to employ a new model of improved, personalized, evidence and data-driven clinical care. </p><p>To arrive at quality data, organizations are spending significant levels of effort on data integration, visualization, and deployment activities but organizations are increasingly restrained due to budgetary constraints and having limited data sciences resources.</p><p>Healthcare faces many challenges, including developing, deploying, and integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical workflow and care delivery. Having the proper infrastructure with the required storage and processing capacity will be expected in order to efficiently design, train, execute, and deploy machine learning and AI solutions. Cloudera is committed to supporting healthcare professionals and institutions to support the next stage of patient care and medical development. </p><p>4. Data Warehousing</p><p>Data Management goes Cloud?</p><p>As more organizations continue to see the economic and ease of use advantages of the cloud we expect to see increased investment in data management in the cloud.  Data analytics use cases continue to lead the charge, especially for self-service, transient workloads, and short term workloads. Yet with new technologies that allow us to share data context (security models, metadata, source, and transformation definitions) we will see many organizations grow in use of cloud data management as more than just a compliment to on-premise models, as well as moving to private and hybrid cloud deployments, with greater confidence.  New data types will continue to be required to satisfy business analytics, including social media and Internet of Things (IoT), driving the need for inexpensive, flexible storage best served by data management in the cloud. The cloud will also support emerging and new use cases such as exploration (iteratively performing ad-hoc queries into data sets to gain insights through discovering patterns) and machine learning without increasing IT resource demands, fueling further adoption.</p><p>5. Machine Learning</p><p>We are just at the beginning of the enterprise machine learning transformation. In 2019, we'll see a new step in maturity, as companies advance from PoCs to production capabilities. </p><p>Enterprise machine learning (ML) adoption will continue as businesses look to automate pattern detection, prediction and decision making to drive transformational efficiency improvement, competitive differentiation and growth.  As early adopters advance from proof-of-concepts to production deployment of multiple use-cases, we'll continue to see an emergence of technologies and best practices aimed at helping operationalize, scale and ultimately industrialize these capabilities to achieve full transformational value.</p><p>Infrastructure and tooling will continue to evolve around efforts to streamline and automate the process of building and deploying ML apps at enterprise scale.   In particular, ML workload containerization and Kubernetes orchestration will provide organizations a direct path to efficiently building, deploying and scaling ML apps in public and private clouds.  We'll see continued growth in the automated machine learning (AutoML) tools ecosystem, as vendors capitalize on opportunities to speed-up time-consuming, repeatable chunks of the ML workflow, from data prep and feature engineering to model lifecycle management.  Streamlining and scaling ML workflows from research to production will also drive new requirements for DevOps as well as corporate IT, Security and Compliance, as data science teams place increasing demands on infrastructure, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, cross-team collaboration capabilities, and corporate security and compliance to govern hundreds of ML models, not just one or five, deployed in production.</p><p>Beyond technology, we'll see continuing demand for expert guidance and best practice approaches to scaling organizational strategy, skills and continuous learning in order to achieve the long term goal of embedding ML in every business product, process and service.  Visionary adopters will seek to build an investment portfolio of differentiated ML capabilities and optimize their people, skills and technology capabilities to best support it. With our modern, open platform, enterprise data science tools, and expert guidance from Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, Cloudera is focused on accelerating our clients' journey to industrialized AI.</p><p>6. Cloud</p><p>As companies understand the value of cloud to their existing infrastructure and applications, choice will become increasingly important. The choice to have a mix of public cloud and on-prem as well as multi-cloud provides companies with the flexibility to choose a solution that best fits their needs.  Any vendor that only offers one option and \"locks in\" a company will find their customers will be at a disadvantage. With this choice of deployment options, the need for a consistent framework that ensures security, governance, and metadata management will become even more important. This will simplify the development and deployment of applications, regardless of where data is stored and applications are run.  This framework will also ensure that companies can use a variety of machine learning and analytic capabilities, working in concert with data from different sources into a single coherent picture, without the associated complexity.</p><p>These options are part of a larger move to a hybrid cloud model, which will have workloads and data running in private cloud and/or public cloud based on the needs of the company.  Bursting, especially with large amounts of data, is time consuming and not an optimal use of hybrid cloud. Instead, specific use cases such as running transient workloads in the public cloud and persistent workloads in private cloud provide a \"best of both worlds\" deployment.  The hybrid model is a challenge for public cloud as well as private cloud only vendors. To prepare, vendors are making acquisitions for this scenario, most recently the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM. Expect more acquisitions and mergers among vendors to broaden their product offerings for hybrid cloud deployments.</p><p>Vinod is the Country Manager for Cloudera for their India operations.

We also talked about the growing 'techlash' buzz for more industry regulation and, while we agreed that there was a need for formal approach around some aspects of the industry, we felt that the best approach at the time might be an industry self-regulatory approach to responsible innovation (see A Case for Responsible Innovation[3]). Our perspective was that the industry was in the best position to develop and enforce responsible innovation standards that would address growing concerns from the public and policy makers about the influence of big tech and emerging tech but would not unnecessarily restrain the innovation that has been the trademark of the industry. We received quite a bit of positive feedback and people were interested in what a self-regulatory approach would look like and whether it might just work. Then the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica news broke[4]. David and I, along with our friend and colleague Rob Mesirow[5], Principal, PwC Connected Solutions, have spent some quality time discussing Big Tech regulation \u2014 and our thinking has evolved.2018: The pendulum starts to swing for big tech regulationThe breaking of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica story in March 2018 may be the moment where we all realized that some level of big tech platform regulation is needed. </p><p>The story (and its aftermath of hearings etc.) set in motion a year that has brought even more attention to the influence of technology and the big tech platforms on our lives and new calls to think about how or whether we 'regulate' the industry. Over the rest of 2018 we saw the regulatory approach move into full swing on the privacy front. While not a reaction to the Facebook situation, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[6] went into effect in May and then California passed its own privacy legislation in June, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)[7]. We have also seen large global tech companies and others implement new policies, procedures and controls to address growing concerns of consumers and policy makers alike on issues ranging from location tracking, facial recognition to hate speech. Finally, towards the end of the year we began to see a divergence within the industry, as some of the big tech players - such as Apple - calling for regulation, while others are less enthusiastic.2019: From privacy laws to concerns about geolocation and artificial intelligencewhat's next?So, where do we go from here on some of the key big tech regulatory issues? The privacy regulatory train has clearly left the station. GDPR has set the standard and most global companies have already modified their data policies, procedures and practices to ensure compliance - at least with regard to their EU customers and employees' data. The passing of the CCPA will extend the scope of customers covered by comprehensive privacy legislation and may trigger similar legislative action by other states, which would further increase the calls for federal privacy legislation in the US to have a consistent privacy legal framework.  We are often reminded that our apps are free because 'we are the product' and perhaps as long as the only result is some targeted ads or a better understanding of retail traffic patterns there is no need for concern or regulatory attention. Privacy legislation such as GDPR and CCPA should provide individuals with more transparency - and more choice - about how their data is used. Anonymized data, however, is not subject to the privacy protections provided under GDPR and CCPA. As more and more data is being collected to power advances in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (see PwC AI predictions[8]), questions are being asked about whether data in the presence of so much other data can ever truly be anonymous. If that is true, will consumers really have the protections they think they do under privacy laws? Will we start to see increasing pressure from policymakers to further limit the amount and types of consumer data that are being collected and how that data is being used? It would seem to be the next step in the evolution of data protection and ethical data use.  The one question we often get is whether we think we will see some regulation of the big tech platforms in 2019. While there is 'buzz' in Washington calling for some level of regulation, it will likely be difficult to build a congressional consensus on what big tech regulation should look like. As with privacy, the states may once again step in (as California did with net neutrality) to address specific concerns. The biggest pressure placed on the tech platforms will likely come from their users who will demand changes to their policies. For now, the 'do it yourself' approach to addressing these issues will continue to be the approach of choice. There has also been some talk of using an antitrust argument to 'break up' some of the biggest companies, but for the most part the big tech companies continue to provide their customers with more convenience at a lower cost and policy makers will be hesitant to interfere with that business to customer relationship.The new normal for the big tech regulatory environmentWhile they may not face the spectre of an onerous regulatory environment in the near future, the big tech companies do understand the policy landscape has changed. They have to dig into their business processes, find the root cause of their problems, fix them, and demonstrate their change to (re)build public trust. In the current environment, these companies have started moving away from the old position of self-regulation to actively seeking to work with lawmakers[9] in Europe and the US.  Similarly, companies deploying emerging technologies such as geolocation, facial recognition and AI, need to understand that their business model is changing. Traditional brick and mortar companies are now becoming data companies and need to build in a different type of analysis into their product development process and their strategic decision making. They need to think ahead about how these new technologies might do harm to their customers and customer relationships and address those concerns in the product design process. We may not quite be at the dawn of a new regulatory era for big technology, but times have definitely changed. It is more important than ever for companies to both lead from the front on responsible innovation and build consensus with policy makers on the appropriate path forward. If companies do not find the right balance in that approach, there may be no choice but for policy makers to step in and take the lead. That may not be the best answer for big tech - or for us.

It is a crucial step in the reform of an economy that is undergoing unprecedented change under a visionary leader. And to them, it has been a massive success.</p><p>DD recognises certain achievements. Saudi Aramco is indeed set to raise at least $25.6bn from the IPO. The sum could rise above $29bn should <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo/saudi-aramco-will-exercise-15-greenshoe-option-in-whole-or-part-during-first-30-days-of-trading-statement-idUSKBN1YD174\"> underwriters exercise the greenshoe</url>, putting the IPO well above the $25bn haul from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba</emphasis>\u2019s 2014 float. </p><p>Saudi Aramco will also become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company by market capitalisation. And Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock exchange, known as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tadawul</emphasis>, appears ready to handle issues arising from a listing that dwarfs everything else on the market.\u00a0</p><p>Taken altogether, however, this is a narrow view of events.\u00a0</p><p>The timeline began in January 2016 when Crown Prince <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mohammed bin Salman</emphasis>,\u00a0pictured above,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://downmagaz.com/business_magazine_economics/73370-the-economist-usa-9-15-january-2016.html\"> took the world by surprise</url> and declared that Saudi Aramco would list its shares.\u00a0</p><p>Prince Mohammed made it clear he wanted to curb the kingdom\u2019s addiction to oil. To do this he would monetise the country\u2019s most valuable asset \u2014 Saudi Aramco \u2014 and use the hydrocarbon sector to pump revenues into his Vision 2030 reforms.\u00a0</p><p>Cue a process that saw Saudi Aramco hire banks, scrub up its books and streamline its operations to make itself as attractive as possible to would-be global investors.\u00a0</p><p>But a $2tn valuation for the company \u2014 a figure first disclosed by Prince Mohammed at the inception of the process \u2014 hindered efforts. Time and again Saudi Aramco failed to convince the outside world that it was worth that amount.\u00a0</p><p>Other events hung over the company, such as an anti-corruption operation that saw more than 300 princes and tycoons locked up in Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton in 2017. That was followed nearly a year later by the gruesome murder of journalist <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jamal Khashoggi </emphasis>by Saudi agents in the country\u2019s Istanbul consulate.</p><p>At the same time, the kingdom\u2019s financial concerns meant that Saudi Aramco turned into a cash cow, forcing the company to strike deals that were imposed on it from above.</p><p>Eventually, the listing was put on hold in favour of a bond issue. The success of the debt offering earlier this year gave renewed impetus for a fresh push towards a flotation.</p><p>Broader concerns about legal exposure ultimately thwarted a multiyear effort to list Saudi Aramco on major markets outside of the kingdom.\u00a0</p><p>Obstacles to a listing \u2014 including the kingdom\u2019s capable former energy minister \u2014 were eliminated. Allies of Prince Mohammed were installed.\u00a0</p><p>Still, a $2tn valuation continued to elude the company. Foreign institutions were unconvinced, believing it was not worth more than $1.2tn to $1.5tn.\u00a0</p><p>Saudi Arabia tried to win them over by promising to pay a bumper $75bn annual dividend, changed royalty payments and lowered tax rates. It has failed to work.</p><p>Geopolitical risk factors and anxieties around corporate governance remained in focus. This led to the kingdom abandoning international roadshows outside of the Gulf and resulting in a pared back listing.</p><p>To drive interest locally, the kingdom pressured wealthy families to invest in the oil company. Domestic lenders were relied upon to provide loans so that local retail investors could borrow to buy shares. Regional allies in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait were asked to stump up and buy big chunks of shares.</p><p>After all that effort, Saudi Aramco managed to sell only 1.5 per cent of the shares in the company. That falls substantially short of the 5 per cent it had earlier sought to list, an amount that would have raised $100bn at a $2tn valuation.\u00a0</p><p>The outcome raises serious questions as to whether Saudi Aramco is better off from all the various contortions it has been forced to go through to make the IPO happen? Time will tell.\u00a0</p><p>What is clear to DD is that the objectives set out by the Crown Prince four years ago have only partially been achieved.\u00a0</p><p>In Riyadh, all eyes are still focused on how to get the group\u2019s valuation up to $2tn even after its shares have begun trading. That\u2019s the subject of our latest must-read story, led by the FT\u2019s Simeon Kerr and Anjli Raval.</p><p>Our colleagues at Lex conclude that a $2tn valuation would be a mirage, convincing only to those willing to believe in it. Go even deeper on how the Crown Prince\u2019s economic reforms face further scrutiny by reading this new FT feature here.\u00a0</p><p>Activism scorecard: ValueAct/Rolls-Royce</p><p>Was <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ValueAct</emphasis>\u2019s ride with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rolls-Royce </emphasis>worth it? That\u2019s what DD is wondering now that the activist investor\u2019s chief operating officer, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Singer</emphasis>, has decided to leave the company\u2019s board.</p><p>In the nearly four years that Singer has spent in the company\u2019s back seat, little seems to have changed. The stock price is marginally up but the aero-engine maker has had a turbulent few years.\u00a0</p><p>Confidence in Rolls-Royce, an emblem of engineering excellence, has been hit over engine issues that the company is still struggling to resolve. Even Rolls-Royce chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Warren East </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/AN_1575564931818784900/rolls-royce-boss-says-cost-of-trent-1000-engine-issues-eye-watering.aspx\"> has admitted</url> that problems with the Trent 1000 engine, which powers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boeing</emphasis>\u2019s 787 aircraft, are costing the company a lot of money.\u00a0</p><p>So when Singer said that the company was on a \u201csolid path forward\u201d while giving no reason for his departure, it was a little difficult to buy.\u00a0</p><p>We can\u2019t help but wonder how another activist with the name Singer \u2014 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Singer</emphasis> that is \u2014 would\u2019ve acted had it been his firm <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elliott Management</emphasis> on the shareholder registry. The Elliott boss, of course, is known as one of the most aggressive activists out there. ValueAct\u2019s Singer by contrast prefers to play nice.\u00a0</p><p>As Singer heads for the exit, there\u2019s another harder-boiled US fund manager building a stake. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Harris Associates</emphasis> already has a near 7 per cent holding, which is less than ValueAct\u2019s 9.35 per cent stake. If Singer\u2019s move is anything to go by, his company\u00a0could quickly follow him to the exit. </p><p>Check out Lex\u2019s take on Singer\u2019s departure here.</p><p>Chelsea FC: That\u2019s why they call it the blues</p><p>US financier <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Todd Boehly</emphasis>, part-owner of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Los Angeles Dodgers</emphasis>, has the blues. But they\u2019re not the kind he was hoping for.\u00a0</p><p>His attempt to buy <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chelsea Football Club</emphasis> from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Roman Abramovich</emphasis> last month fell short of the \u00a33bn valuation the Russian oligarch is reportedly demanding for the English<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Premier League</emphasis> club and was duly rejected. The former president of asset manager<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Guggenheim Partners</emphasis> is reportedly still interested in a deal.\u00a0</p><p>Boehly is the latest in a growing list of US investors eyeing up stakes in European football clubs.\u00a0</p><p>It comes a fortnight after California-based private equity group <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Silver Lake</emphasis> took a $500m stake in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">City Football Group</emphasis>, the owner of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Manchester City</emphasis>, in a deal that valued the company at $4.8bn.</p><p>There are big bucks going into the beautiful game and buyers, including Silver Lake, have been circling Chelsea for some time. In August last year the FT reported that Abramovich had appointed <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raine</emphasis>, a US merchant bank, to conduct a \u201cstrategic review\u201d of the club he bought in 2003.\u00a0</p><p>People close to Abramovich told the FT that he\u2019s not raring to sell but will do so for the right price. It could be difficult to find a buyer at \u00a33bn, however.\u00a0</p><p>Boehly may get another shot.\u00a0 More here from team DD.\u00a0</p><p>Job moves</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lindsay Page</emphasis> is leaving his post as chief executive at\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ted Baker</emphasis> after less than a year on the job as the fashion retailer warned that profits would fall as much as 90 per cent.

And perhaps no day was more pivotal in transforming Google into a powerhouse across the entire digital advertising industry than April 13, 2007, when the company clinched a deal to buy DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The deal turned out to be \"a total game changer, a crucial piece in the larger jigsaw puzzle Google put together,\" said Timothy Armstrong, a former Google executive who championed the acquisition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It has also turned out to be a classic example of why a growing number of antitrust experts say lawmakers need to broadly rethink how mergers are regulated when the buyer is a tech company with strong and growing market power.</p><p>Google's ad business is now a focus of wide-ranging investigations by the Justice Department and state attorneys general. The scrutiny includes whether the company choked off competitors, or shortchanged advertisers and publishers, and how it assembled its ad empire, including DoubleClick, an ad technology company and marketplace.</p><p> The Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust suit against Google by the end of the month. It is unclear whether the case will be focused on the ad business, or concentrate on renewed allegations that Google's search algorithm gives preference to its shopping and other commerce services and hobbles rivals.</p><p> That internal debate, many experts say, points to the challenge facing antitrust enforcement in a fast-moving, complex tech business: Investigations are difficult, long and backward looking.</p><p> Instead, those experts say, the country needs a more preemptive approach, making it much more difficult for big tech corporations to buy other companies \u2014 and perhaps forcing spinoffs if a past acquisition took out a nascent competitor or became a short cut to greater market power. In other words, changing the law so that Google would not have been able to buy DoubleClick.</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews many mergers, approved the DoubleClick deal in a 4-1 vote. William Kovacic cast one of the four assenting votes.</p><p> \"If I knew in 2007 what I know now, I would have voted to challenge the DoubleClick acquisition,\" said Kovacic, now a law professor at George Washington University who is among the experts pushing for stronger merger oversight.</p><p> In Senate testimony last week, Donald Harrison, Google's president of global partnerships and corporate development, described the DoubleClick deal and smaller ones in digital advertising as \"finding a piece of technology\" that the company then invested in and strengthened to accelerate innovation.</p><p> Online ad prices, Harrison said, have fallen over the past decade, and it is a highly competitive marketplace.</p><p> The prizeDoubleClick had a valuable asset: its business relationships and ad-serving technology used by thousands of publishers online.</p><p> In 2007, Google was a tenth of the size it is today. Still, it was a surging company and a heavyweight in search and in search advertising, with $16.6 billion in revenue. And it was headed for the business where DoubleClick made its living \u2014 larger display ads on websites and video ads. Google, for example, was giving away software tools that DoubleClick had charged for. To diversify, DoubleClick created an ad exchange, or marketplace, as a new business and a buffering source of revenue.</p><p> \"But we were terrified,\" recalled Michael Rubenstein, a former DoubleClick executive. The DoubleClick managers and investors decided it was a good time to sell.</p><p> The auction for the company came down to three finalists, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google, said David Rosenblatt, a former chief executive of DoubleClick. The three bids were similar in value, he said, but Google, given its thriving search business, had access to the largest pool of advertisers, complementing DoubleClick's strength with publishers.</p><p> \"The combination with Google made the most sense,\" Rosenblatt said.</p><p> The reviewThe Federal Trade Commission gave Google the go-ahead to buy DoubleClick by December 2007, as did the European Commission a few months later. Looking back, Kovacic said a legal challenge to the deal would have been \"difficult but not impossible.\"</p><p> Another former commissioner said a merger review was a prediction of whether competition may or may not result. But he added that it was an educated guess, made by regulators grounded in the present. No one foresaw the power that tech platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon would amass, said the former commissioner, who asked not to be identified because of potential conflicts with clients of his firm.</p><p> In its 2007 statement allowing the DoubleClick deal, the commission described broad swaths of the digital ad market as \"relatively nascent, dynamic and highly fragmented,\" adding that other big companies \"appear to be well positioned to compete vigorously against Google.\"</p><p>Microsoft, it seemed, could be a formidable rival. Just a month after Google announced the DoubleClick deal, Microsoft agreed to pay about twice as much \u2014 more than $6 billion \u2014 to acquire aQuantive, another digital ad company.</p><p> At the time, aQuantive mainly appealed to Microsoft as a competitor to Google that could slow its expansion plans in advertising. Microsoft saw Google as its most dangerous rival because it posed a threat to Microsoft's lifeblood products, Windows and Office, former executives say. Google was offering free versions of email, document and spreadsheet programs over the internet, subsidized by advertising.</p><p> \"With DoubleClick, Google was playing offense, but aQuantive was a defensive move for Microsoft,\" said Brian McAndrews, the former chief executive of aQuantive. (McAndrews is a member of The New York Times' board of directors.)</p><p> For Microsoft, aQuantive was never really a priority, former executives say, and its leaders departed and it withered. In 2012, Microsoft publicly conceded that the deal had failed, taking a $6 billion write-off.</p><p> While DoubleClick was its largest deal by far, Google built up its ad technology business with a string of acquisitions. It bought startups that made software for publishers, advertisers and mobile ads, including AdMob in 2009, Invite Media in 2010 and AdMeld in 2011.</p><p> Those building blocks and its in-house innovations have given Google a strong presence in every step of buying and selling online ads.</p><p> \"Google has put it all together,\" said Jeffrey Rayport, an online marketing expert at the Harvard Business School. \"Google is the market under one roof.\"</p><p> The competitionGoogle's one-stop shop is a huge convenience for the smaller businesses that generate much of the tech giant's revenue and do not have online advertising expertise. But the Google machine can seem like a fortress to ad tech companies seeking a slice of the market.</p><p> In 2007, with big companies scooping up digital ad properties, Brian O'Kelley saw opportunity. He left Right Media, which Yahoo had just bought and where he had been chief technology officer, and founded AppNexus.</p><p> His ad tech startup was meant to be an independent middleman for advertisers and publishers, an alternative to the rising powers of digital advertising, Google and later Facebook.</p><p> By 2010, the startup was gaining momentum and attracting attention. That October, Microsoft led a $50 million round of venture funding in AppNexus. A month later, O'Kelley said, AppNexus was cut off from DoubleClick, just as the peak holiday marketing season was getting underway.</p><p> \"They almost killed us,\" O'Kelley recalled.</p><p>Google said it could not comment on dealings with specific customers like AppNexus. But Google said that it had policies on \"ad quality, ad content and malware\" and that violations sometimes led to suspending access to the DoubleClick ad exchange.</p><p> The issue, O'Kelley said, was a technical one: Google's software attributed ads it said violated its rules to AppNexus rather than to the advertiser.</p><p> When the AppNexus cutoff raised alarm in the ad industry, Google issued a statement calling AppNexus \"a great partner\" and saying the two companies were working to resolve the matter.</p><p> The problem lasted a few weeks, a temporary blow to the startup. The message O'Kelley and his team took from the episode was that operating a business in the Google ad ecosystem could be precarious and unpredictable.</p><p> Over the next several years, AppNexus struggled at times, but it persevered and emerged as an alternative to the Google marketplace. In 2018, AT&amp;T bought AppNexus for $1.6 billion. AT&amp;T executives spoke of the company as a linchpin in AT&amp;T's vision of creating a television and digital video advertising exchange that would be a counterweight to Google and Facebook.</p><p> But those ambitions were scaled back, and the focus became using AppNexus to provide the best ad tech for AT&amp;T's Time Warner television and video units, including CNN, TBS and TNT. This month, The Wall Street Journal reported that AT&amp;T was looking to sell its digital ad unit.</p><p> Things might look different today if the Federal Trade Commission had made a different decision in 2007, said O'Kelley, who left AT&amp;T in early 2019.</p><p> \"Had DoubleClick not gone to Google,\" he said, \"it's not clear that Google would have been the power it became \u2014 certainly not as easily.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-7d1de570132bdb8a17de62917f56d35d51a1899c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899D9772552F0 NWBKPA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WV-M6N1-DXVP-V2FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Philadelphia Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I walked more than 75,000 steps (35 miles) to scout for the best products and ideas that will keep the tech industry humming. I won't pretend that I hit all 2.6 million square feet of space and 4,000 exhibitors. I was impeded by my age, an unexpected torrential rain storm, and an unprecedented power outage that took down the giant Las Vegas Convention Center central and south halls for 90 minutes. </p><p>But I came up with my list of the best of CES[2], and I hope you enjoy it. I like how some of these ideas come from non-tech companies, much like Carnival cruise lines[3] came up with its wearable for ocean cruises last year at CES. This year, I saw technology fade into the woodwork, and the woodwork came alive in a way that solved real problems. In many cases below, I can't say that the particular device or company will succeed, but I sure want someone to nail the execution. I love the fact that some of the smallest companies came up with some of the best ideas.RoaderAbove: Roader's Time Machine Camera constantly records and captures the previous 10 seconds once you hit the capture button. Image Credit: RoaderThe Roader Time Machine Camera[4] is a video camera that hangs around your neck. It doesn't sound like much, but you can put it in ready mode, and it will record video, buffering the last 10 seconds in its memory. It can run for six or seven hours, recording and then not saving video beyond that last 10 seconds. But when you hit the button, it will save that video \u2014 the last 10 seconds, as well as the next 10 seconds \u2014 in two threads. One is a small format thread which transfers in real time to your smartphone, where you can view it immediately. If you want it, you can download the full high-definition thread of the same video. And you can share it. It's like a time machine because it captures what happened 10 seconds earlier. If you had a regular video camera, or your smartphone camera, changes are you couldn't open it quickly enough to catch the moment. But Roader[5] captures those moments, like your baby's first steps, for posterity. It is a brilliant idea, and using the humble video buffer \u2014 which is meant to enable smooth playback of video \u2014 in such a way could have many applications.Henkel Beauty Care Above: Henkel can evaluate your hair's condition. Image Credit: HenkelHenkel Beauty Care SalonLab[6]\u00a0is one of those ideas that comes from a non-tech company: the 140-year-old Henkel[7], whose researchers saw a way to combine modern analytics, hair care expertise, and custom manufacturing. They created a scanner that beauty salons can use to analyze your hair's molecular structure. They get a quick recommendation from the scientists at Henkel's Schwarzkopf Professional beauty consultants, and the salon can tweak the recommendation just for you. They get measurements on the tip, root, and middle sections of the hair to gauge its health. Then they recommend a shampoo to treat it. Henkel's SalonLab Customizer then creates the shampoo on the spot, and dispenses a personalized mix just for you. You can come back a few weeks later and see if it's working, and that could lead to a tighter relationship between the salon and the customer.Travis the TranslatorAbove: Travis the Translator Image Credit: TravisTravis the Translator[8] may or may not be the Babel Fish[9], the mythical automatic translation device from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And it has rivals such as Google's Pixel Buds[10]. But I love the idea that real-time translation is just around the corner, and it isn't going to be terribly expensive. Travis can understand 80 languages and translate a spoken phrase into any of those languages. I said 'Como se llama?' in Spanish, and it messed up. But someone else corrected me, saying, 'Como te llama?' Then Travis said, 'What is your name?' We couldn't get into extensive testing in the wireless noise of the Showstoppers party at CES, but I really hope that it works. Travis the Translator costs $200 now, and that could be a small price to pay for bridging cultural divides that so many think should remain.RoboraceAbove: Roborace CTO Bryn Balcombe and chief creative officer Rod Chong Image Credit: Dean TakahashiRoborace[11] started as a project a couple of years ago with a vision for improving self-driving car software through autonomous race cars. Nvidia's booth featured a sleek prototype car that was missing one thing: the driver's cockpit. The car could be the foundation of a racing competition between the creators of autonomous car software. In this case, it isn't always the fastest car that is the best. It's the one that can avoid pedestrians and other obstacles on a course that isn't a simple oval. Rod Chong[12], who recently joined as chief creative officer, was previously a video game executive at Slightly Mad Studios, maker of Project Cars. He changed jobs to join the cool Roborace team to bring a gamer's perspective to motorsport competition. The Roborace car has a supercomputer based on Nvidia's Drive PX technology, and a future version will use Nvidia's new Xavier chip[13], which has 9 billion transistors dedicated to artificial intelligence processing. The hardware \u2014 the actual car \u2014 for the different teams will be the same, and the competition will take place in software. It could lead to better AI, much like early race cars led to the creation of disk brakes, Chong said in an interview.Omron HeartguideAbove: Omron Healthcare's wearable blood pressure monitor. Image Credit: OmronI've been waiting a long time for a wearable blood pressure monitor that could prevent people from having heart attacks. Medical giant\u00a0Omron Healthcare[14]\u00a0showed off its Omron Healthguide, a wearable blood pressure monitor that you can wear as a wristwatch and that can deliver clinically validated accuracy. The Japanese company has also created a\u00a0digital platform to track and store heart health data and easily share it with your physician. Many companies have shied away from adding such a feature to heart rate monitors because of concerns about regulatory approval. But Omron is hoping to submit the device for approval this year. It has an inflatable band inside the wristband. It can periodically inflate and then capture your blood pressure at different times in the day. It can do so in your sleep, as irregular blood pressure during rest can be an indicator of a serious health issue. The price hasn't been set yet, and the company is targeting the fall for the launch.SoundfiAbove: Soundfi founders Bill Kehoe (left) and Chris Anastas. Image Credit: SoundfiSoundfi came out of stealth to talk about its plan to bring high-end spatial audio to ordinary headphones and smartphones. Soundfi's new format for headphones adds the fluid sounds of a surround-sound system to your headphones. The startup is trying to create a premium headphone experience, and it modifies content in a spatial way, so that sports, movies, and other content can be fully enjoyed. You could even listen to the movie in a different language through the headphones. I'm no audiofile, but I listened to it. And it sound fuller, louder, and had deeper bass than the headphones I've used in the past.\u00a0Millennials in particular are listening and watching on their smartphones more than ever, but they're forced to listen to rich audio with old-fashioned 2D stereo headsets. 'I'm using VR gaming with spatial audio, but I sit down to listen to a $250 million movie studio experience, and I have to listen to it in theater,' said\u00a0Chris Anastas, founder and CEO of the Los Angeles firm, in an interview with VentureBeat. 'Not every theater is an IMAX. We have a different way to listen to it.' Soundfi-enhanced headphones could also be used inside a movie theater. You could take your own headset and your smartphone, allowing you to hear the sound for the movie through your headphones. It plays back a synchronized version to make sure that your experience is uninterrupted and the sound quality will be great. Anastas has worked on it for more than five years, and his has raised $3 million to date in a few rounds.Dynamics credit cardAbove: Dynamics card has its own display. Image Credit: DynamicsDynamics[15] wants to bring the credit card and debit card into the 21st century. We still have mag stripes on our cards, and those can be easily stolen and used for fraudulent transactions. Chip cards have helped. But Dynamics has a new Wallet Card[16] that is aimed at bring security and uses to a higher level. The cards have a built-in computer, a cell phone connection, and even a display with 65,000 pixels. If you lose the card or report it stolen or forget your pin code, the bank can disable the card through the cell connection and send you a new card. Cards can be couriered\u00a0to the consumer in a matter of hours, and the consumer can restore the wallet by downloading cards. The speed could reduce fraud losses and prevent purchase delays, Mullen said. These are just some of the features that are possible on a card that's connected and has digital processing capabilities.\u00a0Another is that you can now have multiple cards on one Wallet Card.\u00a0Consumers can\u00a0access their debit, credit, prepaid, multicurrency, one-time use, or loyalty cards on a single card with the tap of a button. When you get to a checkout stand, you could choose to pay with points or credit simply by pressing a button on the card. Banks can even target you with discounts if you use a particular account.Dell Mobile ConnectAbove: Dell Mobile Connect lets you take phone calls or read text messages on your PC. Image Credit: DellDell Mobile Connect[17] is meant to bridge computers and smartphones. It does so through a direct connection, either through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. Using that, Dell made it possible for you to use Android apps on your computer, and to perform phone-like functions on the PC. The reason is that we're slaves to the notifcations on our phones and computers, but we sometimes forget to look at both of them. With Dell Mobile Connect, you get a notification on your computer when a call is coming in on your phone. You can use your computer to answer the call, or you can dismiss it and keep working. You can even play smartphone games on your computer with a mouse and keyboard. I like this idea because it smooths the seams between products that were never designed to work together.Travelmate RoboticsAbove: Travelmate's robot luggage will follow you around. Image Credit: TravelmateThis idea appealed to me in part because I was dragging my roller bag through the crowds at CES, running over the toes of countless strangers. Travelmate Robotics has created[18] a self-driving suitcase, which is a robot on wheels that follows you around. If you have cup of coffee and another bag, it's a hassle to drag your suitcase around. Travelmate has packed it with technology including two USB ports for charging devices, an ergonomic handle, a smart lock, speakers, a battery, and sensors that help it navigate through crowds. Of course, it has a problem for now. It costs $1,100 and up. Hopefully, that will come down as volume sales increase.VolocopterAbove: Volocopter Image Credit: VolocopterThe self-driving future isn't limited to just roads. The Volocopter made its debut[19] at the keynote speech of Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. He rode in the self-driving two-person helicopter, as it rose vertically in a warehouse without Krzanich touching any controls. Artificial intelligence might never reassure some of us about its safety, but thrill seekers may be excited to get into a flying machine that controls itself. If the company perfects the machines, we could see vertical traffic like in the science fiction movies The Fifth Element or Star Wars. It's exciting to see all of the progress in drones lead to more ambitious flying machines. Above: Hip Air deploys airbags if you fall. Image Credit: HeliteMy honorable mentions include Hip Air[20], the new Sony Aibo[21], Vayyar[22], Panasonic's faster airplane Wi-Fi[23], Liberty Mutual's Total Home Score[24], Glowforge[25], and the Black Box[26]. I didn't get to see the HTC Vive Pro[27] headset with Wigig wireless adapter, but I'm looking forward to checking it out. <url

A new mobile operator, Free, had entered the market and disrupted it almost overnight. The new operator slashed prices, offering plans that hadn't been seen before in France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">France's three legacy mobile operators were forced to react and drop their own prices. It didn't help. In only three months, Free's market share reached 4 percent. At the end of the following year, its market share tripled. Today, Free controls 15 to 16 percent of the market, making it France's third largest mobile operator. (If you add the six virtual operators to the mix \u2014 meaning companies who lease broadband space \u2014 you'll get a total of 10 different mobile operators in a country with a population one-fifth the size of the United States.)</p><p>\"Digging deeper into that crystallized everything for me,\" says Philippon. \"It was an oligopoly based on three legacy carriers that lobbied very hard to prevent anybody from getting a fourth (mobile) license. For 10 years they were successful. But then, in 2011, the regulator changed and gave a license [to] Free. It wasn't a technological change or a change in consumers' taste. It was purely a regulatory decision.\"</p><p>For French consumers, this one decision changed everything. Instead of paying $55 for a 1-gigabyte plan, the new prices for much better plans cost half that. And prices continued to drop. Today, a Free 60-gigabyte plan costs only $12.</p><p>But Philippon wasn't just interested in what the new competition in the French telecom industry said about French markets. Having lived in the United States since 1999, he compared the French telecom revolution to the American market. The numbers blew his mind. While in France the number of mobile operators was rising, in the US the number was getting smaller (and that number might even decline further, if the planned Sprint-T-Mobile merger goes through).</p><p>The result was a huge price gap between the two countries.</p><p>\"France went from being much more expensive to much cheaper in two years,\" he says. \"The change in price was drastic \u2014 a relative price move of 50 percent. In such a big market with gigantic firms, that's a big change. And it was not driven by technology, it was driven by pro-competition regulation.\" He immediately adds, just to emphasize the irony: \"It happened in France of all places, a country that historically had a political system that made sure there wasn't too much competition. This is not the place where we expected this kind of outcome.\"</p><p>The opposite was very surprising too: The level of competition in the United States, the role model of free-market democracy, was declining.</p><p>Philippon, an acclaimed professor of finance at the New York University Stern School of Business, kept pulling that thread. He gathered an overwhelming amount of data on various markets, took a few steps back to look at the big picture, and then identified a pattern. The result is \"The Great Reversal,\" his recent book, in which he explores and explains when, why, and how, as his subtitle puts it, \"America Gave Up on Free Markets.\"</p><p>The telecom story is just one of many examples Philippon provides throughout the book of non-competitive US markets, in which most or all of the power is concentrated in the hands of a few big companies. It's a situation that makes it almost impossible for new competitors to enter and lower prices for consumers. The airline market is another example, as is the pharmaceutical industry, the banking system, and the big tech companies such as Google and Facebook, who have no real competition in the markets they operate in.</p><p>The book's main argument has a refreshing mix of both right- and left-leaning economic thinking. It goes like this: During the last 20 years, while the European Union has become much more competitive, the United States has become a paradise for monopolies and oligopolies \u2014 with a few players holding most of the market share. As US companies grew bigger, they became politically powerful. They then used their influence over politicians and regulators, and their vast resources, to skew regulation in their favor.</p><p>The fight over net neutrality, to name one example, demonstrates it well.</p><p>\"Guess who lobbied for that? It's a simple guess \u2014 the people who benefited from it, the ISP's [internet service providers]. And they are already charging outrageous prices, twice as high [as] any other developed country,\" Philippon says.</p><p>This growing concentration of power in the hands of a few has affected everything and everyone. It has inflated prices because consumers have fewer options. Wages are stagnant because less competition means firms don't have to fight over workers. Financial investment in new machinery and technology has plummeted because when companies have fewer competitors they lose the incentive to invest and improve. It has driven CEO compensation up, and workers' compensation down. It has caused a spike in inequality, which in turn has ignited social unrest.</p><p>If all of this is too much to wrap your head around, Philippon puts a price tag on it: $5,000 per year. That's the price the median American household pays every year for the lost competition. That's the cost of the United States becoming a Monopoly Land.</p><p>How did this happen? According to Philippon, it's a story with two threads. The European side of this story happened almost by mistake. The American side, on the contrary, was no coincidence.</p><p>When the European Union was formed in the early 1990s, there was a lot of suspicion between the member states, namely France and Germany. (Two World Wars tend to have that effect.) This mistrust birthed pan-European regulators who enjoyed an unprecedented amount of freedom, more powerful than any of the member countries' governments.</p><p>\"We did that mostly because we didn't really trust each other very much,\" he says. Now, 20 years later, \"it turns out that this system we created is just a lot more resilient towards lobbying and bad influences than we thought.\"</p><p>At the same time in the United States, the exact opposite was happening. Adopting a free-market approach, regulators and legislators chose not to intervene. They didn't block mergers and acquisitions, and let big companies get bigger.</p><p>This created a positive feedback loop: As companies grew stronger, the regulators got weaker, and more dependent on the companies they are supposed to regulate. Tens of millions of dollars were channeled into lobbying. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision gave corporate money even more political influence.</p><p>At some point, big companies started using regulation itself to prevent new competitors from entering the market.</p><p>The result wasn't free markets, but \"the opposite \u2014 market capture,\" says Philippon, referring to a situation in which the regulator is so weak it depends completely on the companies it regulates to design regulation.</p><p>Philippon is not the only one who's making these claims. A group of economists from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business holds a similar view. They are called Neo-Brandeisian, after the late Justice Louis Brandeis, who, a century ago, fought to broaden antitrust laws. They believe the big tech companies, for example, managed to rig the system, and fly under current antitrust regulation. They think it is time to break them apart.</p><p>But not everyone agrees with Philippon's narrative or his conclusions. Economists like Edward Conard, author of \"The Upside of Inequality,\" thinks Philippon's claim that big companies are evidence of less competition is upside down. According to his criticism, it's exactly the opposite: These companies became big and powerful because they innovate and give a lot of value to consumers. He also argues that the conclusion that Europe is more competitive and innovative than the United States is preposterous, given that the biggest tech companies are American, not European.</p><p>Philippon addresses this counterclaim in his book. The United States is one giant market of English speakers. Theoretically, if you have a good idea for a new product and you can finance it, you have more than 300 million potential users on day one. In the EU, on the other hand, there are 28 countries, with residents who speak 24 different languages. It's not as simple.</p><p>Philippon, who by the age of 40 was named one of the top 25 promising economists by the International Monetary Fund, also differentiates himself from the Chicago school of thought in one important way: He's not dogmatic, he's pragmatic. Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution to the problem, he suggests a more nuanced approach. This is exactly what makes his case both unique and somewhat tricky to grasp. His approach is neither right nor left.</p><p>\"The idea that free markets and government intervention are opposites, that's bogus. So half of me agrees with the Chicago School and half disagrees,\" he says.</p><p>\"But if you think that you can get to a free market without any scrutiny by the government, that's crazy. That's simply untrue empirically. We need to make entry easier to increase competition, that's the objective,\" he says. \"And the way to do so sometimes means more government intervention.\"</p><p>OK, but how do you do that? According to Philippon, each case is different.</p><p>\"In some cases it will be by more intervention. Like maybe force Facebook to break from WhatsApp. And sometimes it will be by less intervention. Kill a bunch of regulations and requirements for small companies,\" he says.</p><p>The first idea, at least, has caught a lot of public attention during the last year, and has been a talking point of the presidential campaigns of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg was recorded saying that if Warren wins, it will \"suck for us.\" Warren's plan for the big tech companies, for example, includes \"reversing mergers,\" which means uncoupling WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook. Her plan would also forbid Amazon being both a marketplace and a vendor at the same time.</p><p>But can any of these interventions actually happen? And if so, what would they mean for American consumers? Those are more complicated questions.</p><p>If big tech companies were broken up, Philippon estimates that the average American consumer won't be affected financially.</p><p>\"Since people don't pay these companies directly, it won't change the bottom line for the middle class, it won't have a big impact on people's disposable income,\" he says.</p><p>What would have a tremendous impact on Americans' lives and income is to keep on going beyond the big tech companies. \"We should go after the big ticket items \u2014 telecom, transport, energy, and healthcare. That's where you want action, but there is much less bipartisan support for that,\" he says.</p><p>Something similar to the French telecom revolution is still far from happening in the United States, but the fact that the 2020 campaign is already pushing competition-promoting ideas back into the public discourse is a reason for cautious optimism, according to Philippon. Nevertheless, he warns, we should not let this mild optimism mislead us.</p><p>\"Free markets are like a public good: It is in nobody's interest to protect them. Consumers are too dispersed and businesses love monopolies,\" he says. \"So to take free markets for granted, that's just stupid.\"</p><p>Shaul Amsterdamski is senior economics editor for Kan, Israel's public broadcasting corporation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-5fae3808-12cc-11ea-a0eb-206272d252fd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMP-4051-DYHJ-31V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1936\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 1, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000A108</classCode><className>FREE SAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Except that outcome was never realized. We can argue about what Net Neutrality rules did and did not accomplish in a moment, but now I want to explore the most sensational of all the post-Net Neutrality fears: the death of the Internet. If you're still reading, you know that the FCC voted to repeal Net Neutrality rules (aka the Open Internet) and replace it with the 'Restoring Internet Freedom' order. </p><p>The outcry from the Open Internet camp has been loud, hyperbolic, hypothetical, and mostly based on the fundamental principles of 'what if.' For some background and my personal 'what if?' musings, read this[1].'If Net Neutrality Is Repealed, the Internet Will Die!'I'm paraphrasing, of course, but this is what many proponents of Net Neutrality believe. My issue with this line of thinking is that the idea presupposes the Internet was previously alive and well. It was not. Since the beginning of this decade, the Internet has become dominated by a handful of exceptionally big and powerful ISPs (Comcast, Charter, AT...Verizon, etc.) and another handful of exceptionally big and powerful walled gardens and ecosystems (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet). The free and open Internet became the paid and closed Internet long ago, and Net Neutrality was not doing much to change that. In a post-Net Neutrality world, there is a fear that start-ups and small companies will not be able to compete with big companies. There's a fear that ISPs will be able to censor competitive content or degrade your ability to consume it if you don't pay more. There's a fear that ISPs could package the Internet into bundles like cable TV (movie sites, social media sites, blogs, etc.). There's a fear that privacy is over forever. I'm not done listing all the things people fear about the repeal of Net Neutrality, but let's just stop here. No one knows exactly how all of this is going to unfold. But remember, consumers always vote with their wallets - there is only so far any of this can go.'If Net Neutrality Is Repealed, the Internet Will Live!'I'm not paraphrasing here. Very few people understand the underlying technology of the Internet well enough to describe what it is, or how it works. Therefore, very few people can argue about the life or death of the Internet in the context of Net Neutrality. What proponents of the Restoring Internet Freedom order are mostly in favor of is minimal (or no) government regulation. That, in case you are wondering, is not a technical argument. The overarching theory behind the FCC's repeal is that the free market will take care of the Internet - just like it did before 2015 (the year Net Neutrality rules were enacted).The Fine Print If you believe that the Internet was free and open before December 14, 2017, you are not alone. You're also not correct. Under Net Neutrality there were fast lanes and slow lanes, and a loophole called zero-rating which allowed services like T-Mobile's 'Binge On' to exempt certain streaming services from its data counts. There were other loopholes written into the rules where specific clauses began, 'Subject to reasonable network management,' which basically meant ISPs could throttle traffic if they thought they had to. Wait. What?  Yes, under the recently repealed rules, if a network operator had to choose between throttling your service to allow other users on its network to enjoy reasonable connectivity, and not throttling your service, you got throttled.Thinking About the FutureWhat will change now? Nothing much. The big ISPs are all standing outside in the bright sunshine, and none of them are going to mess around with your connectivity while this is a hot-button issue. In the meantime, a bunch of very high-priced lawyers and expert witnesses are about to get busy. That's pretty much guaranteed.  We could see some bad actors do bad things. Especially where consumers have limited ISP choices. Won't that be like the 'death of the Internet?' No. Stop saying that! I can imagine a future where ISPs use their newfound freedom for data collection. They can now monetize your data just like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and other big tech companies. Some may try to sell ads, but the smart ones will create universal IDs that work across devices and across wired and wireless networks (a little corp dev will be needed here). This will give them a huge competitive advantage over their single walled garden or single ecosystem competitors.  In a strange twist, an ISP-based universal ID schema would help small companies and start-ups and every advertiser compete with big tech in ways that are not possible today. (To understand how this might come to exist, you need to understand the way information travels over networks. Do some personal remediation on how the Internet works so you and I can have a Socratic discussion about this.) In practice, it would change the balance of power in content delivery, advertising, digital assistance, and messaging. Which is why, generally speaking, ISPs love the FCC decision and why, generally speaking, content providers hate it.Innovation and Continuous ImprovementThe Internet will continue to evolve. Prior to 1986, all of the information ever created by humans was estimated to be equal to 227 Exabytes (EB). Today, IBM estimates that we are creating 1.86 EB of data per hour, that's over 16 Zetabytes (ZB) per year. And just in case that stat doesn't blow your mind, IBM also believes that humans have created 90 percent of the data ever created in the last 24 months. There are several sources that predict we will increase our data creation 10x (to roughly 163 ZB per year) by 2025. Much of this data will be moved around the world over the Internet. We are going to need some rules. In fact, we're going to need a law. From my perspective, that law would prohibit blocking lawful content, prohibit throttling traffic, and prohibit paid prioritization. This should not be done under Title II of the almost 100-year-old Communications Act of 1934. We need a new federal law that reflects the will of the majority of the American people. Of course, I can also imagine a future where Washington, DC, is too gridlocked to pass any kind of meaningful laws to govern the Internet. Which means every time a different political party gets the opportunity to appoint an FCC, the rules will change. Which is why the reports of the 'death of the Internet' have been greatly exaggerated. Author's note:\u00a0This is not a sponsored post.

When the question first rattled my adolescent mind, I took it to my mom and dad, and received wildly divergent answers. I cracked the beige-in-every-way set of World Book encyclopedias in our attic. And after poking around on the shelves of my anti-clerical father, I found Nietzsche and realized that God was actually dead.</p><p><br/>If I were a boy now, we all know exactly where I would turn for an answer. All of us enter our questions, both about where to brunch and the meaning of life, into a box with a magnifying glass at its right edge, next to the multicolored logo of the deity that presides over our informational world. Its name, like the lord of the universe, begins with the letter G.<br/>What is God? It is only a subject that has inspired some of the finest writing in the history of Western civilization-and yet the first two pages of Google results for the question are comprised almost entirely of Sweet'N Low evangelical proselytizing to the unconverted. (The first link the Google algorithm served me was from the Texas ministry, Life, Hope &amp;amp; Truth.) The Google search for God gets nowhere near Augustine, Maimonides, Spinoza, Luther, Russell, or Dawkins. Billy Graham is the closest that Google can manage to an important theologian or philosopher. For all its power and influence, it seems that Google can't really be bothered to care about the quality of knowledge it dispenses. It is our primary portal to the world, but has no opinion about what it offers, even when that knowledge it offers is aggressively, offensively vapid.<br/>If Harold Bloom or Marilynne Robinson had engineered Google, the search engine would have responded to the query with a link to the poet John Milton, who is both challenging on the subject of God and brave on the subject of free speech-and who would have been a polemical critic of our algorithmic overlords, if he had lived another four hundred years.<br/>If we're going to pay tribute to the idea of free expression, then we need to pause to pay obeisance to Milton's exhilarating, timeless statement of first principles, the pamphlet Areopagitica. It appeared in 1644, long before he went blind and dictated Paradise Lost. He wrote Areopagitica in the shadow of the English Revolution, a revolution against theocracy that came to exhibit its own theocratic tendencies. It was a moment when the cracks in English society permitted the growth of dozens of religious sects, each with its own evolved doctrine, many of them-Quakers, Baptists-still with us.<br/>Milton was a Puritan himself, but a comrade in the left wing of the movement. A left-wing Puritanism, let alone a sensualist Puritan, is admittedly hard to imagine. But Milton wrote passionately and bravely in defense of divorce on the grounds of spousal incompatibility. (An argument that he perhaps came to consider after his 16-year-old wife returned to her family, taking a three-year break from Milton.)<br/>The English Revolution was a time when spiritual, intellectual, and rhetorical foment began to wildly accelerate towards anarchy. It was during these very years that Thomas Hobbes wrote his famous response to these chaotic conditions, the Leviathan, yearning for a heavy-handed reassertion of order. And the Parliament obliged that yearning, hoping to regain control with a little bit of old-fashioned suppression. It wanted to require the licensing of books prior to their publication. Censorship. This is what riled Milton to write the Areopagitica.<br/>Beyond the Areopagitica's condemnation of censorship, Milton was really defending the underlying spiritual and intellectual chaos, and the institutions that nourished it. In his lifetime, the printing press had changed everything. The machines churned out religious propaganda, designed to infuriate, which had the effect of eliciting an endless series of rebuttals. There was a national mania for newspapers. The Areopagitica paid implicit homage to the printing press and explicit homage to everything that rolled off it. He accorded books religious significance, which was really the highest compliment he could offer, since he took his religion so seriously: \"Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were, in the eye ...\"<br/>At the core, Milton was defending something intensely private-the conscience, the freedom of each citizen to arrive at their own religious conviction. \"Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.\" But Milton also stirringly articulated  how the formation of private convictions required public spaces, public institutions-what J\u00fcrgen Habermas so famously defined as the \"public sphere.\"<br/>At the time of Milton's birth, in 1608, there wasn't much of a public sphere in England. By the time, he wrote Areopagitica, it was robust: coffee houses, newspapers, book publishers and bookstores, theatres, and meeting places-the locales that allowed individuals to come together to form a public. These were spaces largely outside the grasp of church and state-and, in fact, many of these institutions emerged with the express purpose of liberating society from the grasp of church and state.<br/>Nobody designed the public sphere from a dorm room or a Silicon Valley garage. It just started to organically accrete, as printed volumes began to pile, as liberal ideas gained currency and made space for even more liberal ideas. Institutions grew, and then over the centuries acquired prestige and authority. Newspapers and journals evolved into what we call media. Book publishing emerged from the printing guilds, and eventually became taste-making, discourse-shaping enterprises. What was born in Milton's lifetime lasted until our own.<br/>Nothing was perfect about this public sphere. It could be jealously exclusive, intolerant of new opinion, a guild that protected the privileges of its members and blocked worthy outsiders. Its failings are legion. Still, the public sphere provided the foundation for Western democracy; it nurtured a faith in reason and the intellectual powers of the individual; it was the platform for free expression and a shield against tyranny.<br/>Ye cannot make us now lesse capable, lesse knowing, lesse eagarly pursuing of the Truth, unlesse ye first make yourselves that made us so, lesse the lovers, lesse the founders of our true Liberty. We can grow ignorant again, brutish, formall, and slavish as ye found us, but you then must first become that which ye cannot be, oppressive, arbitrary, and tyrannous as they were from whom ye have free'd us. [Milton's Areopagitica]<br/>It took centuries for the public sphere to develop-and the technology companies have eviscerated it in a flash. By radically remaking the advertising business and commandeering news distribution, Google and Facebook have damaged the economics of journalism. Amazon has thrashed the bookselling business in the U.S. They have shredded old ideas about intellectual property-which had provided the economic and philosophical basis for authorship.<br/>The old, enfeebled institutions of the public sphere have grown dependent on the big technology companies for financial survival. And with this dependence, the values of big tech have become the values of the public sphere. Big tech has made a fetish of efficiency, of data, of the wisdom of the market. These are the underlying principles that explain why Google returns such terrible responses to the God query. Google is merely giving us what's popular, what's most clicked upon, not what's worthy. You can hurl every insult at the old public sphere, but it never exhibited such frank indifference to the content it disseminated.<br/>This assault on the public sphere is an assault on free expression. In the West, free expression is a transcendent right only in theory-in practice its survival is contingent and tenuous. We're witnessing the way in which public conversation is subverted by name-calling and harassment. We can convince ourselves that these are fringe characteristics of social media, but social media has implanted such tendencies at the core of the culture. They are in fact practiced by mainstream journalists, mobs of the well meaning, and the president of the United States. The toxicity of the environment shreds the quality of conversation and deters meaningful participation in it. In such an environment, it becomes harder and harder to cling to the idea of the rational individual, formulating opinions on the basis of conscience. And as we lose faith in that principle, the public will lose faith in the necessity of preserving the protections of free speech.<br/>At the core of the public sphere was the idea of individual choice, of autonomous individuals independently arriving at their opinions. Truth was always messier than this. The public sphere was always rife with manipulation-political persuasion, after all, involves a healthy dose of emotionalism and the tapping of submerged biases. But humankind is entering into an era where manipulation has grown simultaneously invisible, terrifyingly precise, and embedded in everyday life.<br/>And now, the tech giants are racing to insert themselves more intimately in people's lives, this time as  personal assistants. The tech companies want us to tie ourselves closely to their machines-those speakers that they want us to keep in our kitchens and our bedrooms: Amazon's Echo, Google Home, Apple's Siri. They want their machines to rouse us in the morning and to have their artificial intelligence guide us through our days, relaying news and entertainment, answering our most embarrassing questions, enabling our shopping. These machines don't present us with choices. They aren't designed to present us with a healthy menu of options. They anticipate our wants and needs, even our informational and cultural wants and needs.<br/>What's so pernicious about these machines is that they weaponize us against ourselves. They take our data-everywhere we have traveled on the web, every query we've entered into Google, even the posts we begin to write but never publish-and exploit this knowledge to reduce us to marionettes. All this has become painfully evident in the controversies over Facebook. With this intimate portrait of our brains, Facebook maps our anxieties and pleasure points. It uses the cartography of our psyche to array the things we read and the things we watch, to commandeer our attention for as long as possible, to addict us. When our conversation and debate is so intensely and intricately manipulated, can it truly be said to be free?<br/>Now the bill is coming due. Big tech is no longer a magical new invention; it is an established social fact. People can see the ugly implications of its creation, and they're begging the companies to clean it up. People are asking them to eliminate links to sex trafficking, to stymie hostile foreign powers intent on exploiting their technologies. And if we stopped there, we might cheer them for exhibiting a new sense of responsibility. But we won't stop there. We will have glimpsed the ability of the big tech companies to purge the detritus from the public sphere, to broom away the broken bottles of hate speech and the shards of noxious opinion. People will increasingly ask them to create a safe, hygienic space for conversation-and they will acknowledge this request. As Facebook puts it in its recently released \"community standards\": \"People need to feel safe in order to build community. We are committed to removing content that encourages real-world harm, including (but not limited to) physical, financial, and emotional injury.\"<br/>It's hard not to be sympathetic to this impulse. Does anyone other than ISIS really want Google highlighting ISIS recruitment videos? Do people want Facebook used as a haven for the sharing of white-supremacist ideas? But there's no way that Facebook and Google can play this role with any sense of true neutrality. (The fear of political backlash will always haunt them. That's why Facebook created a group of advisers to make sure that it wasn't being biased against conservatives. Somehow I doubt that they will have a similar board to ensure against anti-socialist bias.) To state the obvious, these are multinational corporations, with an ultimate interest in their bottom lines. They will never be capable of regulating the public sphere that they control in any name other than their own profit.<br/>It is stunning to watch the ideological backsliding of Big Tech. Not so many years ago Silicon Valley postured as libertarian. But when Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, asked Mark Zuckerberg a pointed question about his power, the Facebook CEO supplied a response that befuddled the senator: \"I think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people's lives, is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or not.\" And then in an unintentionally revealing moment that captured the danger inherent in this answer, the senator asked Zuckerberg to submit a draft of regulations that he might accept. Once Facebook uses its political muscles to sculpt regulation, it become almost impossible to imagine that the regulation will advance the common good.<br/>In fact, now that these companies bestride the markets in which they roam, the primary danger they face isn't meddling regulators or hyperactive legislators. What the behemoths of Silicon Valley truly fear is the possibility that antitrust laws will be deployed to shatter them into much smaller units. Mark Zuckerberg can live with the government imposing rules about harassment, hate speech, and even privacy, because those rules will help stave off the debate over monopoly. And such regulation would likely even entrench Facebook's power. Smaller challengers to Facebook will struggle to deal with a complicated, pricey regulatory apparatus. Facebook could come to be seen as the necessary bulwark against the demons of the Internet, the demons that it helped unleash.<br/>We knew well about the dangers of a cozy relationship between the state and giant corporations-and how regulations that are ostensibly designed to limit corporate power are captured and twisted by the most powerful companies to stymie competition. Such relationships define our political economy. But tech companies carry a very different sort of cargo-they trade in the commodities of speech. Once we extend the state into this realm, we're entering danger territory.<br/>John Milton railed against this very thing in Areopagitica-the dangerous hubris of government playing the role of gatekeeper to the world of knowledge:<br/>Are twenty men enough to estimate all the genius and the good sense of England? Is there to be a monopoly of knowledge; are the products of all English brains to be stamped like broadcloth and woolpacks? The affront is not to the educated alone: the common people are just as much wronged by the notion that they are too giddy to be trusted with a flighty tract.<br/>We don't need to use our imaginations here. There are examples all over the world-in Russia, in China-where governments have made their peace with social media, by setting the terms that govern it. These regimes permit a cacophony of ideas, except for the ones that truly challenge political power.<br/>Donald Trump should be the object lesson that shuts down this debate before it begins. Not since World War I has the United States had a president who so disrespects the idea of free speech-who threatens to file libel lawsuits and muses openly about loosening libel laws, who attempts to rile hatred of media, who talks fawningly of authoritarian leaders in other countries.  <br/>Yet these times, for all of their historic echoes, are different. The political dynamic is familiar, but the technology is unprecedented. The present global explosion of anxiety and hate is unlike anything most of us have ever witnessed. People don't know how to confront these evils, which come in nearly every direction, in the form of theological zealots, demagogic populists, avowed racists, and trollish misogynists. In the face of such menace, it's natural to appeal to a higher power for protection-but in our panic we need to be clear about which threats are genuine and which are merely rhetorical. And panic shouldn't lead us to seek protection that inadvertently squashes our own liberties.<br/>John Milton was an expert on dangerous ideas. His greatest work, of course, was Paradise Lost-about the Garden of Eden, the ultimate story of human exposure to danger. Even in the Areopagitica, he had interesting thoughts about the lessons of Adam and Eve-about how the forbidden fruit is the essence of freedom and the precondition for morality. Long before John Stuart Mill wrote about the marketplace of ideas, Milton wrote beautifully about the imperative of testing our ideas:<br/>Assuredly we bring not innocence into the world, we bring impurity much rather: That which purifies us is trial, and trial is by what is contrary. ... They are not skillful considerers of human things who imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sin. Good and evil we know in the field of this world grow up together almost inseparably.... It was from out of the rind of one apple tasted, that the knowledge of good and evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into this world. And perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into of knowing good and evil, that is, of knowing good by evil.<br/>Milton, the Puritan, believed that Truth could never be known until the second coming. Until then, it would remain elusive. And in the meantime, we all search for the truth, discovering it through errors, unimpeded by censors, unafraid of what we might encounter.<br/>Now stand that faith in reason next to the ethos of Big Tech, next to the Google and Facebook attitude toward truth. Silicon Valley doesn't understand truth as a quest or trial, but as an engineering challenge. They believe human behavior and human choices can be predicted by algorithms on the basis of past behavior. (Eric Schmidt has boasted that Google can predict where you will be 24 hours from now based on where you have been.) They believe that our lives can be programmed to be more efficient. By steering and nudging us, by designing the architecture of our decision-making process, they claim to be relieving of us of the burden of choice. Silicon Valley talks endlessly about the virtues of the frictionless life.<br/>Facebook has made it possible to live in a filter bubble, where we don't have to contend with the unpleasantness of confronting opinions we dislike-and where there's a mute button to effortlessly quiet voices we would rather not hear. Mark Zuckerberg's dream, the dream he continues to profess, even after all of the controversy, is the dream of global community-the idea of a global network that transforms the planet into a place of understanding. As we join Zuckerberg's community, he fantasizes that the sense of connection will cause our differences to melt away-like a digital version of the old <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VM2eLhvsSM\">Coca Cola commercial</url>, or, as I argue in my book,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/World-Without-Mind-Existential-Threat/dp/1101981113\">World Without Mind,</url> a revival of the sixties counterculture and the vision of life on a commune.<br/>Yet the Miltonic search for truth and knowledge is all about friction, about the human growth that comes with the complications of human existence. Argument is the most important form of friction, and the distilled essence of democracy. Our public sphere has been a place of profound discomfort, because \"that which purified us is trial, and trial is by what is contrary.\"  Preservation of democratic society means that there is no escaping the trial, no fleeing from the discomfort.<br/>In other words, preservation of democracy requires preserving this ecosystem of ideas that has miraculously persisted with us since the 17th century. People can't afford to be seduced by the false prophets of disruption, the charlatans who argue that we abandon old wisdoms in the face of new gadgets. Just because Facebook insists that media shifts its resources into video doesn't mean that media needs to oblige. We need to shape the culture so that the prestige of engineering doesn't continue to come at the expense of the humanities. We need to preserve literature as a primary technology for interrogating the meaning of life. We need to resist the tendency to reduce the world to data. And when an adolescent asks us about God? We can at least answer in the negative, by holding up our phones and saying, 'It's not this.'<br/><br/>This essay was adapted from      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/bezoek/agenda/festival-van-het-vrije-woord\">a lecture</url> delivered in Hilversum, Netherlands, on May 2, 2018.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-thedeathofthepublicsquare564506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SRG-VMF1-JCG7-V29F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

It is necessary and healthy for experts to discuss the virtues and perils of different ideas and approaches, no matter how creative, conservative, revolutionary. I am not sure, however, that many of the ongoing debates will assist society in reaching sensible solutions. I don't know where the right balance lies, but I do have a clear idea of how we are not going to attain it. </p><p>So this is not a post on substance; it is (mostly) a post on process. An important disclaimer: I do have professional interests in this debate and work for companies at the center of these debates (on the last point I discuss how that affects my personal views and attitude). 1-.The tone. It is perplexing to see how much animosity these debates create, how many personal attacks and high-pitched criticism they trigger, how they make awkward friends and new enemies. But we should all be above that. We probably all think we are on the right side of the debate (which is not necessarily a bad thing). But that doesn't entitle anyone to be offensive or dismissive of those with different ideas. If anything, we have the responsibility to demonstrate the merits of our ideas, and not let them lose weight because of our tone. Being a lawyer is mostly about empathy[1], and too often we show too little. Can't we try to be less controversial and more civilized? [A tip: the ones who insult the least are the ones who tend to be right]. All these are but minor issues in the grand scheme of things. Even within competition law, there are arguably more important ongoing debates[2] eliciting less passions and commentary 2-. The temptation of partisanship and simplicity. Unfortunately, moderate views are often a faithless creed. Pablo wrote some time ago about the 'footballization[3]' of competition debates. As he explained, 'it would seem it is all about joining a team - becoming a loud, proud member of a camp that supports everything that comes from within and opposes whatever comes from the other side'. That's sadly true. Life is much more comfortable when you align yourself with one view and know always what line to take. If only things were that easy Most debates are about trade-offs, and that is certainly the case of debates on big tech. If you refuse to understand the real points others are making, your arguments will be weaker, it not flawed. That's an easy mistake to make (perhaps I make it all the time), but that's precisely why we should resist the instinct. More nuance would do much good. More active listening and constructive engagement with/by the affected stakeholders (companies, consumers, industry associations) would also be desirable. 3-. The lack of neutrality. Last weekend we received a critical comment pointing to alleged conflicts of interests in lawyers/economists participating in these discussions. (fourth comment on this guest post[4]). So take this also as a comment on that comment. There is nothing wrong with people advocating for private interests; that's the way the system works. Lawyers and consultants do that for a living, and I don't see how one can criticize us for doing our job. That also includes academics who may choose to do consulting, which I believe it's absolutely fine. To be sure, we are all for clear disclosures to permit closer scrutiny on the merits by the audience. That said, I can see the point that there is too little neutrality in professional circles and in academia. People like Pablo are all too rare. It's legitimate and most helpful for academic to voice out their views, no matter whom they benefit. But I do admit there's a problem when advocacy work is concealed as an academic piece. [A tip: If someone's research is only dictated by their client base, then you know they are not academics]. We should also hear more from more people, including experts in related areas. 4-. The theory vs the evidence. Our job, as lawyers or economists, consists in applying established rules and principles to a given set of facts. We are not entitled to our own facts, nor to ad hoc principles that would ensure we always win. The role of evidence is not to support preconceived views, but to challenge and test them in order to verify them. And this is particularly true for public authorities, who have the higher (and more difficult) responsibility to get it right. So we should not exclude the evidence that contradicts our instincts; we should look forward to it, because it may allow us to understand whether our views may be wrong, and how they can be polished. And if it is the case that this evidence is wrong, irrelevant or confirms our views, then we can reason through it and explain why. The EU Courts were right to point out that the only way of avoiding manifest errors is to have all the necessary evidence to avoid a complex situation. By the way, we can all probably agree that this should also apply to legislation and regulation. 5-. The frustration of uncertainty. Even (or particularly) when we look hard into evidence, the right answer is often 'we don't know' or 'it depends'. That is frustrating, but it is what it is. This is true in most areas entailing some degree of complexity, also when it comes to digital markets. The Special Advisers' Report, for example, was open about it: there are many issues we simply don't know. Can network effects tip markets? It depends. Can data be the source of competition concerns? It depends. Can self preferencing be anticompetitive? It depends. If there's anything we know, is that we know very little. Does this suggest that we should never take action? Not at all! It means there should be even closer scrutiny, just not broad brushing. [For a similar message, see para. 80 of the recent Budapest Bank Judgment]. At the end of the day, we might still have doubts. Without recognizing that there might be doubts and shades of gray, instead of just black or white, we are unlikely to make progress. 6-. The alleged blind gap (?). What sets competition law apart from other areas of the law is its wideness and its reliance on vaporous legal concepts. That's its blessing (it can immediately adapt to new realities and new economic theory), but that's also its curse (hammer-nail, etc). So I think that it's unfair on the discipline to dismiss it due to alleged blind gaps. Now, where is that gap? Is there any practice harmful to competition that EU competition authorities are not/ have not been able to effectively pursue? In my mind, the GermanFacebook case (discussed here[5]) is a perfect example of how we are failing to address, or properly frame, the real challenges for enforcers. Nothing in the D\u00fcsseldorf Court's Order suggests that there is anything wrong with a new theory of harm based on exploitative privacy policies; the reason for the annulment was lack of evidence. In reality, the problem is not that competition law and competition authorities cannot adapt to new theories and realities. If there is evidence of anticompetitive conduct in digital markets (which may very well exist), then competition authorities have the tools to address that. The problem is that we (as plaintiffs, authorities, etc) need to do our homework if we want to establish an infringement on the basis of evidence. 7-.The approaches to uncertainty (on the rule of law). What frustrates some people about competition law might actually not be the fault of competition law, but of Law alone. Legal principles and rules (allocation of burdens, presumptions, etc) articulate ways of dealing with uncertainty. These rules incorporate the lessons of experience and factor the relevant trade-offs. In any sanctioning regime, arguably the most important presumption is the presumption of innocence. When we speak about 'Type-2 errors', etc. we also need to understand that we have to operate within the confines of the rule of law and of that presumption. That might be uncomfortable, but that is what makes us civilized and what protects us from arbitrariness. Let me invoke, again[6], the words of General Court President Marc van der Woude: 'where the contested conduct of the public authorities is repressive in nature, it is hard to conceive, at least in free democratic societies, that citizens and firms can be condemned on the basis of estimates, approximations or guesses, even if they are informed ones. Uncertainty must then be balanced against the requirements of the presumption of innocence []. [T]his balance is struck by relying on legal concepts, such as the burden of proof'. To the extent that any proposals deviate from these principles, we will not be making progress. 8-.The role of the Courts. The trend that worries me the most in these debates is that of 'taking antitrust away from Courts[7]', proclaiming that precedents are but relics that hold progress down. In my view, this is intimately connected with all of the above. We might disagree with Courts (coincidentally, that tends to happen more when we lose), but they are what makes the system work. We should cherish the legitimacy that Courts give to any decision and policy. That is why I resist the proposals to turn to regulation (where there is no judicial review or evidence standards). I never really understood the Furman Report's point that 'appeals systems can contribute to the competition authority's risk aversion' (to be sure, I get the point; just not why that's a problem). In addition, the EU case law is remarkably sensible and balanced in its approach to competition law (for more, see here[8]), and we should be proud about that. I've said this for many years when people systematically accused EU Courts of being biased in favor of the Commission, and I say the same now that some people criticize the case law as putting limits on enforcement. It's remarkable that the Courts can be accused of the two things at the same time, which brings me to my next point (almost done!). 9-.What the near future holds. The Courts will soon have the chance to rule on some of the test cases at the heart of these debates. Regardless of what they do, remember: the system does work. I am personally invested in some of these cases, but I will oppose any suggestion, on any side, invoking an outcome to point to alleged flaws in EU competition law or in our enforcement system. And those will come. Whatever side loses will need to accept it and adjust. In a properly functioning system, cases are won and lost (see here[9] for Pablo's recent take on that). That is how the law progresses, even if at a cost, and even of not always in a straight line. If test cases work, then that shows the tested hypotheses are correct. If they don't, then that would show the test-case was flawed or that the evidence was insufficient, but it will say nothing about our discipline (other than that the system works). 10-.My own bias. Are my views affected my work and background? Of course they are. The fact that I spend a lot of my time on these issues does make me more sensitive to them, and also contributes to shaping my views. Does that mean I might be wrong? Perhaps, yes. I've never worked on a case where I didn't believe on the points we were making, so it's a matter of probability and common sense that I might have been wrong on a good number of occasions. It is healthy to keep that in mind, and it is a reason to more carefully scrutinize the merits of what we say. Actually, for quite some time I've been holding thoughts on many of these issues, avoiding to engage and comment on important issues, simply because I realize my comments may be suspect of bias (and also because of my first observation about the tone of the debates). That might have been a mistake. My commitment: Together with Pablo, we commit to making this platform a place where people can discuss different ideas openly and respectfully. We will comment on the issues that we believe are important, because there are important things going on in competition law at the moment (even if more important things are happening outside competition law). We will always play the ball, and not the man. We won't be offensive or dismissive to people with contrary views. And we will continue to like and invite (here and to our conferences) people who think differently from us.

This column was written by Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru. He is a senior editor at National Review, visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and contributor to CBS News.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives remain convinced that the tech industry is biased against them. They point to evidence that Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube are staffed disproportionately by liberals, a fact that nobody seriously denies. In a fascinating essay for the New Atlantis, Adam White argues that there is a deep alignment between their corporate culture and the assumptions of modern liberalism.</p><p> A nearly inevitable result, conservatives say, is that the companies are more likely to try to suppress conservative content as offensive: taking down tweets and posts from righties and directing traffic elsewhere. The companies deny they have displayed bias, even as admit they have made occasional mistakes in content moderation.</p><p> One school of conservatives argues that while the tech titans' decisions may be wrong and worthy of condemnation, it is not government's business to regulate their decisions because they are private companies.</p><p> According to this reasoning, people who are unhappy with Facebook's policies should condemn or boycott it. They should cajole Twitter into adopting better policies. (One suggestion has been that Twitter act toward its users the same way the First Amendment makes the government act toward citizens.)</p><p> Or they should try to start a rival site.</p><p> What these conservatives don't want is for government to force the companies to behave differently, beyond holding them to their own terms of service.</p><p> Another group on the right thinks that the hands-off approach is dogma unsuited to the world we actually inhabit. The social-media companies are too large a part of our society, and host too much of our political debate, for the government to leave them alone.</p><p> A leading voice for this second group is Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. His criticisms of social-media companies are wide-ranging. He has gone so far as to question whether the talent they employ would be doing more good in other parts of the economy.</p><p> Political bias is among his main concerns. \"Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,\" he has said. \"They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.\"</p><p> Soon after his election in 2018, Hawley argued that the big tech companies are benefiting from a government-granted privilege. He observed \u2014 on Twitter, naturally \u2014 that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives these companies immunity from liability for content that appears on their sites.</p><p> They get this immunity, he suggested, on the condition that they serve as forums for \"a true diversity of political discourse.\" He called for congressional investigations to see if they were meeting that condition. Congress has subsequently held hearings on it.</p><p> Republican Senator Ted Cruz, questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made the same point as Hawley: \"The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.\"</p><p> What they're saying: Facebook can be a message board with no responsibility for the messages tacked onto it. Or it can take an active role in shaping content, in which case it assumes legal responsibility for that content.</p><p> Those who fear government regulation in this area (and not just conservatives) have pushed back against Hawley and Cruz. They point out that the law also gives the companies immunity for actions they take against obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable material, even if that material falls under the First Amendment.</p><p> We can split the difference on the question of what the law assumes. The CDA does not require companies to be neutral about the political content of messages they host in order to have immunity. It was, in fact, written to encourage them to police obscenity, which is why it's called the Communications Decency Act.</p><p> The law was enacted in 1996, after a web service provider, Prodigy, had been found to incur liability for postings because it had tried to make itself family-friendly and deleted some material it found to be offensive. Legislators thought it was unfair and undesirable to punish a company for trying to do the right thing. But it's fair to say that back then there was a background assumption that the companies would not be tilting left or right.</p><p> So what options does the government have to deal with the perceived problem?</p><p> Perhaps we should split the difference on the policy question, too. The companies are too important to ignore, but government regulation is full of dangers.</p><p> It does not seem like too much for Congress to ask that the immunity it has provided be conditioned on some more transparency from the companies about how they decide what content to promote, hide or suppress. One possibility would be to require the companies to disclose summary information about how they make these decisions; another, perhaps easier to administer, would be to require them to publish a database of content they have deleted.</p><p> Before we decide either to regulate the tech companies or leave them alone, let's find out if the anecdotes of bias are just anecdotes, or something more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-ff0185417933345f7e5ff5188be44060f1e787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28992F84BC67F6 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-7VS1-JBCN-4440-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Haverhill Gazette<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Donald Trump was awarding first prize on his reality TV show, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">The Apprentice,</url> to a corporate lawyer turned mobile cupcake entrepreneur.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The year was 2010 and, in the decade that followed, these two hustlers from New York with fiercely devoted followings would come to represent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">the two faces of America.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Miranda produced Hamilton, a musical megahit that with hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&amp;B and Broadway recast America's founding fathers as people of colour in a hymn to the immigrant nation. Trump smashed and grabbed his way into the political class, and the White House, with a nationalist, nativist message that promised to build a border wall to keep Mexicans out and make America great (white) again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Open, inclusive and endlessly curious, Miranda personified a progressive sensibility and social consciousness around gender, race and the environment, largely associated with America's booming coastal cities. Trump, revelling in ignorance and narcissism, embodied a populist rage against change, political correctness and liberal elites, gaining traction in small towns and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">rural areas</url> that felt left behind.</p><p>As 2019 drew to a close, America's existential crisis was the yawning, ever-growing chasm between these two tribes. With <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">an assist from gerrymandering,</url> blue states got bluer and red states got redder; Republicans became more white and more male while Democrats diversified. The parties were more polarised on issues such as abortion and the climate crisis than anyone could remember.</p><p>Words such as \"unprecedented\" still had some life in them just over a decade ago when Barack Obama, on the verge of his signature healthcare reform known as Obamacare, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">hosted a poetry jam at the White House</url>. Fresh from Broadway success, Miranda tried out a song \"about the life of somebody who embodies hip-hop - treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton\". Far-fetched as the idea seemed, Hamilton took flight as theatre's hottest ticket, featuring songs that caught on with school children across the country.</p><p>The musical that cast black actors as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other slave-owning founding fathers also became synonymous with the Obama years. First lady Michelle Obama called it \"the best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life\" and recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">tweeted that Miranda</url> \"painted as honest a portrait of our country as I've ever seen\".</p><p>Obama performed a freestyle rap with Miranda in the White House Rose Garden. And introducing him at Hamilton showcase in March 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">he declared:</url> \"In the character of Hamilton, a striving immigrant who escaped poverty, made his way to the New World, climbed to the top by sheer force of will and pluck and determination, Lin-Manuel saw something of his own family, and every immigrant family.\"</p><p>Obama was such a rupture in the master narrative of the white, wealthy male being the only possible US leader.</p><p>  Halifu Osumare    </p><p>Hamilton made its off-Broadway debut at New York's Public Theater in February 2015. Four months later and three miles away, Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">declare his candidacy for US president,</url> declaring: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best ... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"</p><p>It was the pivot point, the moment that ensured this would be a broken-backed, contradictory decade that would confound future historians with a simple question: how did America go from Obama, its first black president, to Trump, champion of racist conspiracy theories about his predecessor's birthplace?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Halifu Osumare,</url> professor emerita in the department of African American and African studies at University of California, Davis, says: \"It really shows the extreme schizophrenia of this country and how race is still very much a part of the original sin to portray itself in the world as the beacon of democracy that is always looking at the inalienable rights of the individual while at the same time reinforcing racial difference and hierarchy.</p><p>\"I think that Barack Obama was such a rupture in the master narrative of the white, wealthy male being the only possible leader for this country, the original sin of America erupted with Donald Trump and we had permission for the violent racist past to re-emerge.\"</p><p>Osumare, a black popular culture scholar, points to the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in deadly violence in 2017 as an example of this re-emergence. \"We were in denial during the Obama administration about it because it seemed that the election of the first black president meant that we were moving into a post-racial society. But we saw very quickly the backlash where that underbelly of racism re-emerged with Donald Trump.\"</p><p>The anti-Obama backlash had been evident in the stirrings of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">the conservative Tea Party movement</url>. Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin were congressional staffers at the time. They would later become progressive organisers, co-founders of the group       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Indivisible</url> and authors of the book       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">We Are Indivisible: A Blueprint for Democracy After Trump.</url></p><p>Greenberg says of the Tea Party: \"We had a lot of personal experience with them and what was really clear was that it was a white identity grievance movement. Sure, they had signs that were about the debt or the deficit but it was code for their sense that somewhere some undeserving other was getting something that their tax dollars were going for.\"</p><p>She adds: \"[Trump] threw out the dog whistles and just used a bullhorn and it turned out that enough people within the Republican party were into that that he was able to seize the nomination and seize control of the party.\"</p><p>Wielding his bullhorn, Trump also seized control of the White House in November 2016. It was a moment of reckoning for America, forcing white liberals to confront a storied racism (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">The Case for Reparations</url> by Ta-Nehisi Coates) that many had believed would inevitably wither away.</p><p>There were other forces in play. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">The opioid crisis</url>.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">The highest suicide rate</url> since the second world war.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Declining life expectancy</url>. Automation and factory closures ripping the hearts out of communities.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Cavernous inequality</url>, pitting the top 1% against the bottom 99%, a natural conclusion of Ronald Reagan's \"trickle down\" economics.</p><p>\"The Obama presidency was much less radical than it needed to be in order to halt the trends which led us to Trump. That doesn't mean that it's all Obama's fault; most of it is not his fault,\" said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Timothy Snyder,</url> a history professor at Yale University, says.</p><p>\"But I think the eight years of Obama were in large measure a kind of self-congratulatory illusion instead of the very tough remaking of politics that probably had to happen if we weren't going to get a Trump.\"</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis, which saw vast sums of money spent to rescue Wall Street, produced aftershocks that found populist expression in outsiders such as 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Bernie Sanders,</url> targeting corporate power from the left, and Trump, scapegoating immigrants and elites from the right. They reshaped politics and put the centrism of Bill Clinton and company in retreat.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Jamie Raskin,</url> a Democratic congressman from Maryland, says: \"The Democratic party moved left and the Republican party moved right and we have a contest between duelling populisms now in America. We've got an authoritarian, racially tinged populism, and we've got a progressive economic and social populism, and that's the battle for the soul of America.</p><p>\"The question is, will the centre hold and where is the centre? Is the centre somewhere between these two populisms or is it inside one of them?\"</p><p>But along with Trump's gaudy escalator ride, something else happened in June 2015 that gave hope to Raskin and millions of others. The US supreme court <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">legalised same-sex marriage</url> nationwide. It was a win for the America of Hamilton. Not even Trump, wildly popular with Christian evangelicals, has suggested trying to overturn the decision.</p><p>Raskin recalls:  \"When I first ran for state senate in 2006, one of my planks was marriage equality. I'll never forget, when I made my announcement speech, a woman came up to me and said, 'Jamie, great speech but one thing, you've got to take out all that stuff in there about gay marriage because it's never going to happen and even the gay candidates don't talk about it, and it makes you sound like you're really extreme. like you're not in the political centre.'</p><p>\"That was when I had an epiphany and I said, 'Thank you for telling me because it makes me realise it's not my goal to be in the political centre ... I think that progressive impulse has really taken over the Democratic party. The country has become far more progressive on a whole bunch of issues that were considered taboo in 2010.\"</p><p>This was reflected in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">protest movements</url> that have rattled old hierarchies:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Occupy Wall Street</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Black Lives Matter</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Extinction Rebellion</url>. Not long after Trump, who had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">bragged about groping women without their consent</url>, was elected to the White House,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">the #MeToo movement caught fire</url>, holding Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and other predatory men to account and demanding to know why victims had gone unheard for so long.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">David Remnick,</url> editor of the New Yorker magazine, notes: \"We are a contradictory people, and just one example is that at a time when a proven misogynist is the president, a #MeToo phenomenon happens and moves us forward.\"</p><p>#MeToo thrived on social media. But so too did disinformation, fake news, invasions of privacy, downright lies and Russian propaganda. Perhaps the biggest winners of the decade were Facebook and Google, which defied regulation, raked in billions of dollars and changed the way we live now. Big tech enabled and incentivised people to pick fights, strike the snarkiest pose and flaunt the worst of themselves, often behind a cloak of anonymity. The giants became as influential as nations but without UN obligations.</p><p>These echo chambers were reinforced by cable news networks that seemed to occupy alternative universes, offering radically different chyrons and commentaries on everything from Robert Mueller's Russia investigation to judge <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court confirmation</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump</url> over his alleged attempt to bribe Ukraine to investigate one of Trump's key political opponents.</p><p>The reality TV president exploited these post-truth fractures to deny science and withdraw America from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Paris climate accords</url>, which may prove the most consequential decision of the decade. With this and a thousand other egregious acts, he could always rely on support from Fox News, which       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">perfected its model during the Obama years</url> then seemingly tethered itself to Trump's White House.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">David Brock,</url> founder and chairman of Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog, says: \"Fox has given the conservative side a whole set of counter-facts and a whole different reality that they can live in that has destroyed the consensus in the country, destroyed the notion that we are operating from the same set of facts and then kind of arguing how to interpret them... I don't think we'd be here in the moment we're in without Fox.\"</p><p>Social media plays an auxiliary role, Brock argues. \"You can definitely see that the producers at Fox are paying attention to these far-right extreme websites and social media outlets: Breitbart, the Daily Caller, 4chan, 8chan and Reddit. Of course, the Trump campaign was very adept at exploiting all that and they got a leg up on the Democrats digitally in 2016 and they still have it.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Niall Ferguson,</url> an author, historian and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, has a different emphasis. \"Cable news has been around a while; that wasn't new,\" he argues. \"What was new was Facebook and Google's dominance of news consumption through news feed and search and, of course, the advent of targeted political advertising.</p><p>\"I strongly believe that without social media - and certainly be more precise and say Facebook - Trump wouldn't have won. That was much more important than Fox. I think the big tech companies totally changed the structure of the public sphere and it's still the case that many people don't get that.\"</p><p>I think the big tech companies totally changed the structure of the public sphere.</p><p>  Niall Ferguson    </p><p>The rise of social media played a big part in the collapse of America's local newspapers, devouring advertising revenue and creating \"news deserts\". Facebook and other social media are \"unquestionably\" responsible for accelerating political tribalisation and a breakdown of a shared reality, Ferguson argues.</p><p>\"It's not just polarisation; it's atomisation now. The most striking difference between 2016 and 2012 at the national aggregate level was the depressed African American turnout. That didn't happen just by accident. That was the core objective of the Trump social media campaign and it worked.</p><p>\"This is the big difference that this decade will be remembered for, and also the fact that during this decade the big tech companies basically were unrestrained by any regulation and were able to take the implications of financing online content with ads to the illogical reductio ad absurdum of having Russians post political content anonymously on American social media.\"</p><p>America's \"cold civil war\", as veteran journalist Carl Bernstein characterises it, has been described as a more profound <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">threat to national security</url> than any external foe. Combined with Trump's manta of \"America first\", which shakes the trust of old allies in Nato and beyond, the US is widely seen to be ending the decade in a far weaker position than where it began.</p><p>Ferguson published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire</url> in 2004, soon after George W Bush's disastrous war in Iraq - still arguably a greater blow to America's standing, and to trust in leaders, than anything Trump has said, done or tweeted.</p><p>\"The real story of the last 10 years has been that there are two ways of managing imperial decline,\" the British-born historian says. \"You could do it a kind of refined, law professor way as Obama did, giving lectures and then taking actions like not intervening in Syria. Or you can just walk away with complete insouciance as Trump has. I think it's really actually two flavours of the same ice cream.\"</p><p>The past decade witnessed the deaths of former president George HW Bush and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Senator John McCain</url> and, some argue, the Republican party as they knew it when it became consumed by a personality cult. The bipartisan unity that followed the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks now seems a relic from a different era.</p><p>Back in 2010, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv\">Leon Panetta</url> was the director of the CIA, planning the raid that would kill Osama Bin Laden the following year.

Though it's a term he doesn't like, the \"internet of things\" will be decentralizing in ways our first decade of Big Data wasn't, as big tech companies marshalled our information for their purposes, not ours.</p><p>It's the future. Who knows? Maybe he's right. One good thing about decades is they're so long in human-years that columnists'turn-of-decade prognostications usually end up being forgotten. My reaction to Kessler's hopefulness is that if he's right and history does rhyme, we seem to be doing history backward. The 2020s may well be like the 1920s. But haven't we just been through a paler, less brutal version of the 1930s? A big financial crisis, followed by a worldwide recession, followed by worldwide recrimination against the social system supposedly in sway. (\"Supposedly\" because to read some recent accounts, the capitalism of 2008 was \"red in tooth and claw.\" In reality, it was an almost completely domesticated version of the 19th-century beast.)</p><p>To be sure, 2008's Crash didn't actually lead to a worldwide depression. Only in a few places did unemployment reach the 20 per cent or higher that was common in the 1930s. After decades of unprecedented prosperity, however, we're not as tough or resilient as our great-grandparents were. So even if it wasn't a depression, it was earth-shattering to us.</p><p>As in the 1930s, a worldwide movement toward democracy took a hit. But despite loose talk in the universities about rising fascist tendencies, we had very little experience of true, honest-to-badness fascism of the sort that between the wars took hold in Germany, Italy, Japan and several other places that should have known better. We also, on the other side of the spectrum, didn't have many people arguing for genuine communist revolution, as many intellectuals did after 1929. We did have the rise of Corbynism, however, and its revisionism regarding privatization, and we saw a gaggle of Democratic presidential candidates follow the lead of a fulminating 78-year-old Vermont senator fomenting a \"social revolution,\" albeit a democratic one. On the other hand, the leftism may have crested with Elizabeth Warren's concession that \"medicare for all\" would have big effects on choice and taxes - as Canadians can attest.</p><p>On the whole, it was a bad decade for the reputation of free markets. Command-and-control made a comeback, whether for financial markets, carbon suppression or, as Corbyn would have had it, running Britain's railways. Almost everywhere markets were in disrepute. Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton ended the decade with a column arguing \"it is hard to imagine a body of work more antithetical to broad thinking about inequality and justice\" than the Chicago school of economics, which is still the leading advocate of markets.</p><p>Does history rhyme? Probably not. But maybe it swings. The world got over the radical tendencies of the 1930s in the quieter, more conservative 1950s. The increasingly regulatory and interventionist 1960s and 1970s were followed by the Reagan and Thatcher \"revolutions\" (which were actually reforms rather than revolutions). They in turn have been followed by recurring growth of the state, especially in matters financial, environmental and, now, technological.</p><p>My guess is that this latest swing to interventionism will once again raise appreciation for the virtues of markets. The essence of the Chicago view, after all, has never been that markets are perfect or all-wise, just that, as Churchill said of democracy, \"in this world of sin and woe\" they're better than \"all those other (mechanisms) that have been tried from time to time.\"</p><p>Chicago's central contention, which comes via Austria, is that decentralized, bottom-up systems in which many different players compete are much better at generating and making use of the myriad bits of information on which economic progress depends than are centralized, top-down systems, even ones run by society's best and brightest (who in fact are not always in charge). The top-down systems can't compute correctly. And they inevitably become corrupt - not necessarily in the crony-capitalism sense, though there is that, but as the political directors of the process turn the machinery to their own interests.</p><p>No doubt fans of centralization will argue that in coming years Big Data and quantum computing will make all the required calculating much more tractable. The basic problem is not the number-crunching, however, but deciding what goes into the algorithms. As for corruption, unless the robots take over completely it is unavoidable.</p><p>Thus the enduring virtue of leaving as many things as possible to the impersonal grindings of markets, which, my guess is, will be more appealing in 2029 than it may seem now. And on that note: no more forecasts until December 2029, at the end of what I hope will have been a decade brimming with health and prosperity for all loyal readers - and everyone else, too. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Since then, a number of authors have taken up the antitrust cause, arguing that not just the tech sector but also other major sectors of the U.S. economy are too concentrated and less competitive than they should be. Even Fox News Channel\u2019s Tucker Carlson has jumped on the tech-monopoly band wagon.   Are these authors and commentators right? What is their evidence? More fundamentally, what do the words \u201cmonopoly,\u201d \u201cmarket power,\u201d and \u201ccompetition\u201d mean, and what monopolies or forms of market power should we worry about? Also, when we do worry about monopoly or market power, what are the appropriate policies to deal with it? It turns out that economists over the last 200 years have carefully considered many of these issues. Unfortunately, some of their insights have been lost, and one main reason is that many of those who worry about monopoly have a static, rather than a dynamic, view of competition.    A brief note, before we proceed, on the terms \u201cmonopoly,\u201d \u201cmarket power,\u201d and \u201ccompetition.\u201d    First, monopoly and market power. The former, as \u201cmono-\u201d implies, refers to an industry in which there is only one firm. Yet most economists, including this author, don\u2019t use the term in that strict sense. Most economists today use the term \u201cmonopoly\u201d as a synonym for \u201cmarket power.\u201d To say that a firm has market power is to say that the firm could raise the price of its product by, say, one percent, and not have its sales fall to zero. Of course, that\u2019s true of most firms. Even if your small local convenience store raised its prices by one percent, its sales would not vanish. There are only a few markets in which firms have no market power, and they tend to be in agriculture. The largest producer of wheat in the United States, if it raised its price by one percent above the spot market price on the commodities exchange, would sell no wheat.    How about \u201ccompetition?\u201d Here modern economists go back and forth between two quite different meanings. In the 1920s, economists started using \u201ccompetition\u201d to mean what they called \u201cperfect competition.\u201d Under these conditions, every company produces exactly the same product as every other company in the industry, no company spends a cent on advertising because every buyer is assumed to be perfectly informed already, and all companies charge the same price to the penny. When I first learned this concept in an introductory economics class at the University of Winnipeg in 1970, perfect competition didn\u2019t seem to me to be perfect at all. It just seemed boring.    Fortunately, economists also use the term \u201ccompetition\u201d to mean what most non-economists mean by it. Firms compete when they figure out ways to cut costs and then take business from their rivals by cutting prices, giving some of the gains from the cost cut to consumers. They compete when they introduce new products, when they provide service along with their products, when they advertise, and when they enter new markets, to name only a few. Ask an economist over a beer if such activities are forms of competition and the odds are high that he or she will say yes.    Now to the issue. In the above-referenced CEA report, the Obama economists used a conventional measure of monopoly and market power\u2014share of revenue earned by the 50 largest firms in various industries. They showed that in a number of industries, that share rose substantially between 1997 and 2012, implying increased industrial concentration. Why does that statistic matter? The usual argument is that the more concentrated an industry, the easier it is for its firms to collude.    But there are two major problems with that measure. I\u2019ll illustrate the first one by highlighting an industry referenced in Obama\u2019s CEA report. A table in the report shows that the top 50 firms in the second largest U.S. industry, retail trade, earned $1.56 trillion in revenue in 2012. Their share of revenue increased from 25.7 percent of industry revenues in 1997 to 36.9 percent, an increase of 11.2 percentage points.    Did any major change in retail trade happen between 1997 and 2012? Yes. It was called Amazon. Before Amazon became important, what typically mattered for you as a retail customer was the amount of competition in your local market. So, if you lived in San Francisco and wanted a lawn chair, you might go to Sears (remember them?), Home Depot, or your local hardware store. But after Amazon came into being, you had another major choice: saving a lot of time traveling from store to store and, instead, sitting at your desk or kitchen table, or even lounging on your old lawn chair, and ordering from home. Not only did you save time but also the odds are that you got a lower price. In short, Amazon made the relevant market for you much more competitive. And it did that even while, at times, wiping out local competitors.    The second problem with using increased concentration as a measure of monopoly is that it ignores how the firms with an increasing share of revenues got there. Consider Amazon again. There is no doubt that a major factor in the increasing revenue share of the top 50 retail firms between 1997 and 2012 is the growth of Amazon. Did Amazon get to that point by charging high prices? Not at all. It got there with innovation that slashed retailing costs and then by sharing much of the cost reduction with consumers.    The point is that Amazon became such a major player by innovating. And its market share is a reward for innovation. Other companies in other industries got large market shares for innovating also and did better than Amazon on the earnings front. Their large profits are their reward for innovating. My UCLA mentor Harold Demsetz made this point in a 1973 article in the Journal of Law and Economics and economist Tim Bresnahan did the same with newer data in a 1989 chapter in a book on industrial organization.    Competition is dynamic. The great early-20 th -century Harvard economist Joseph Schumpeter put it well. In his 1942 classic, Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy , Schumpeter wrote:    But in capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not that kind of competition [DRH note: he\u2019s referring to \u201cperfect competition\u201d] which counts but the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply,  the new type of organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance)\u2014competition which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.    Indeed. Schumpeter summed it up by writing that omitting this kind of dynamic competition was \u201clike Hamlet without the Danish prince.\u201d    Many economists, including the above-mentioned Obama CEA and University of Chicago economist Raghuram Rajan in his recent book The Third Pillar point to John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil of New Jersey as an example of a monopoly that was out of control and needed to be reined in by antitrust. But what they don\u2019t point out is what University of Chicago economist Lester G. Telser noted in his 1987 book, A Theory of Efficient Cooperation and Competition : \u201cThe oil trust [Standard Oil of New Jersey]did not charge high prices because it had 90 percent of the market. It got 90 percent of the refined oil market by charging low prices.\u201d    What about the fear many people have had, especially for the tech sector, that those who get a head start gain from what economists call \u201cnetwork effects?\u201d The idea is that if, say, 100 million people sign up for Facebook, the next person will sign up because of the network already there. The argument is plausible in theory but fails badly in practice. Consider MySpace. In early February 2007, MySpace had 153.5 million users . Victor Keegan of The Guardian seemed to think that it would only grow. It shrank. What replaced it? Facebook. So much for the overwhelming power of network effects. It\u2019s not that network effects don\u2019t matter. They do. But innovations strike at the foundations and very lives of firms that thought they had solid network effects.    Which brings us to the tech sector. In a July 29 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats stepped up to show both their ignorance about and hostility towards the tech sector. One view that seemed widely held by both Republicans and Democrats is that companies in the tech sector are monopolies. Fortunately, economist Alec Stapp, Director of Technology Policy at the Progressive Policy Institute has punctured the dominant myths about big tech and antitrust. His analysis is a tour de force and I won\u2019t try to replicate it here. But I will highlight his finding that the big tech companies are not monopolies. He noted, for instance, that Facebook has 23 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market and Google has 29 percent. Those two also fiercely compete with each other.    Does my analysis mean that all is good in the world of competition? Not at all. There are serious lapses in competition, but most of them are due to government policy.    I referred earlier to how most economists use the term \u201cmonopoly.\u201d But there\u2019s an older tradition that the late University of Chicago economist George Stigler discussed in his article \u201c Monopoly \u201d in The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics . In this tradition, monopoly refers to an industry in which the government forcibly restrains competition.    Governments in the United States limit competition in four main ways (1) restrictions on entry into an industry, (2) tariffs and import quotas, (3) regulation that appears neutral but is not, and (4) patents and copyrights    Consider restrictions on entry. Government does so in two main ways: with regulations that require government permission for firms to enter and with occupational licensing regulations that require individuals to get permission to enter a profession. An example of the first is Certificate of Need (CON) regulation that gives existing medical firms standing to argue against competition from new hospitals and clinics. Among the most extreme such laws are those in Illinois. In his 2008 book, Code Red , Northwestern University health economist David Dranove pointed out one unintended but totally predictable result of Illinois\u2019s CON laws: Illinois hospitals are located where Illinoisans lived in the 1950s. What an apt acronym: Those laws really are a con. Indeed, they played a role in former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich\u2019s becoming a con himself.    I\u2019ve discussed the problem with occupational licensing on this site earlier. The good news is that economists, including the Obama CEA, have in recent years criticized occupational licensing.    Another government-imposed restriction of competition is protectionism in the form of tariffs and import quotas. The whole point of such restrictions is to limit competition. The U.S. economy is less competitive than it would be if we had completely free trade.    The third way governments restrict competition is with regulations that appear neutral but limit competition through economies of scale in compliance. A given regulation might cause a firm with $10 billion in sales to spend $10 million to help it comply. That expenditure is 1/1000 of sales. But to comply with that same regulation, a firm with only $100 million in sales might need to spend $1 million. That\u2019s 1/100 of sales, which is 10 times as much as the large firm\u2019s expense. This can force out small firms, making an industry less competitive than otherwise. Indeed, in my 1976 Ph.D. dissertation, I showed that this was exactly what happened with the coal industry in the late 1960s and early 1970s.    I won\u2019t discuss patents and copyrights here other than to note two things. First, there is a large controversy among economists about whether these are a good idea. The best argument for them is that they create an incentive to innovate. But, as I point out in \u201c Patents ,\u201d in the first edition of The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics , there are some downsides. One is that many inventions would have happened without patents and so the monopolies that patents create in those cases are unnecessary. Another is that the prospect of a patent can divert innovators away from unpatentable innovations to patentable ones. The second thing to note is that in a world with the Food and Drug Administration regulating the flow of new drugs, we would have almost zero new drugs without patents.    Is competition alive and well in the United States? In the areas where government allows it, yes. In areas where the government restricts competition, no.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Henderson</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a special April 2016 report titled \"Benefits of Competition and Indicators of Market Power,\" President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) worried that competition in American industries was declining and hinted at increasing antitrust enforcement. Since then, a number of authors have taken up the antitrust cause, arguing that not just the tech sector but also other major sectors of the U.S. economy are too concentrated and less competitive than they should be. Even Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson has jumped on the tech-monopoly band wagon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Are these authors and commentators right? What is their evidence? More fundamentally, what do the words \"monopoly,\" \"market power,\" and \"competition\" mean, and what monopolies or forms of market power should we worry about? Also, when we do worry about monopoly or market power, what are the appropriate policies to deal with it? It turns out that economists over the last 200 years have carefully considered many of these issues. Unfortunately, some of their insights have been lost, and one main reason is that many of those who worry about monopoly have a static, rather than a dynamic, view of competition.</p><p>A brief note, before we proceed, on the terms \"monopoly,\" \"market power,\" and \"competition.\"</p><p>First, monopoly and market power. The former, as \"mono-\" implies, refers to an industry in which there is only one firm. Yet most economists, including this author, don't use the term in that strict sense. Most economists today use the term \"monopoly\" as a synonym for \"market power.\" To say that a firm has market power is to say that the firm could raise the price of its product by, say, one percent, and not have its sales fall to zero. Of course, that's true of most firms. Even if your small local convenience store raised its prices by one percent, its sales would not vanish. There are only a few markets in which firms have no market power, and they tend to be in agriculture. The largest producer of wheat in the United States, if it raised its price by one percent above the spot market price on the commodities exchange, would sell no wheat.</p><p>How about \"competition?\" Here modern economists go back and forth between two quite different meanings. In the 1920s, economists started using \"competition\" to mean what they called \"perfect competition.\" Under these conditions, every company produces exactly the same product as every other company in the industry, no company spends a cent on advertising because every buyer is assumed to be perfectly informed already, and all companies charge the same price to the penny. When I first learned this concept in an introductory economics class at the University of Winnipeg in 1970, perfect competition didn't seem to me to be perfect at all. It just seemed boring.</p><p>Fortunately, economists also use the term \"competition\" to mean what most non-economists mean by it. Firms compete when they figure out ways to cut costs and then take business from their rivals by cutting prices, giving some of the gains from the cost cut to consumers. They compete when they introduce new products, when they provide service along with their products, when they advertise, and when they enter new markets, to name only a few. Ask an economist over a beer if such activities are forms of competition and the odds are high that he or she will say yes.</p><p>Now to the issue. In the above-referenced CEA report, the Obama economists used a conventional measure of monopoly and market powershare of revenue earned by the 50 largest firms in various industries. They showed that in a number of industries, that share rose substantially between 1997 and 2012, implying increased industrial concentration. Why does that statistic matter? The usual argument is that the more concentrated an industry, the easier it is for its firms to collude.</p><p>But there are two major problems with that measure. I'll illustrate the first one by highlighting an industry referenced in Obama's CEA report. A table in the report shows that the top 50 firms in the second largest U.S. industry, retail trade, earned $1.56 trillion in revenue in 2012. Their share of revenue increased from 25.7 percent of industry revenues in 1997 to 36.9 percent, an increase of 11.2 percentage points.</p><p>Did any major change in retail trade happen between 1997 and 2012? Yes. It was called Amazon. Before Amazon became important, what typically mattered for you as a retail customer was the amount of competition in your local market. So, if you lived in San Francisco and wanted a lawn chair, you might go to Sears (remember them?), Home Depot, or your local hardware store. But after Amazon came into being, you had another major choice: saving a lot of time traveling from store to store and, instead, sitting at your desk or kitchen table, or even lounging on your old lawn chair, and ordering from home. Not only did you save time but also the odds are that you got a lower price. In short, Amazon made the relevant market for you much more competitive. And it did that even while, at times, wiping out local competitors.</p><p>The second problem with using increased concentration as a measure of monopoly is that it ignores how the firms with an increasing share of revenues got there. Consider Amazon again. There is no doubt that a major factor in the increasing revenue share of the top 50 retail firms between 1997 and 2012 is the growth of Amazon. Did Amazon get to that point by charging high prices? Not at all. It got there with innovation that slashed retailing costs and then by sharing much of the cost reduction with consumers.</p><p>The point is that Amazon became such a major player by innovating. And its market share is a reward for innovation. Other companies in other industries got large market shares for innovating also and did better than Amazon on the earnings front. Their large profits are their reward for innovating. My UCLA mentor Harold Demsetz made this point in a 1973 article in the Journal of Law and Economics and economist Tim Bresnahan did the same with newer data in a 1989 chapter in a book on industrial organization.</p><p>Competition is dynamic. The great early-20th-century Harvard economist Joseph Schumpeter put it well. In his 1942 classic, Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter wrote:</p><p>But in capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not that kind of competition [DRH note: he's referring to \"perfect competition\"] which counts but the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance)competition which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.</p><p>Indeed. Schumpeter summed it up by writing that omitting this kind of dynamic competition was \"like Hamlet without the Danish prince.\"</p><p>Many economists, including the above-mentioned Obama CEA and University of Chicago economist Raghuram Rajan in his recent book The Third Pillar point to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil of New Jersey as an example of a monopoly that was out of control and needed to be reined in by antitrust. But what they don't point out is what University of Chicago economist Lester G. Telser noted in his 1987 book, A Theory of Efficient Cooperation and Competition: \"The oil trust [Standard Oil of New Jersey]did not charge high prices because it had 90 percent of the market. It got 90 percent of the refined oil market by charging low prices.\"</p><p>What about the fear many people have had, especially for the tech sector, that those who get a head start gain from what economists call \"network effects?\" The idea is that if, say, 100 million people sign up for Facebook, the next person will sign up because of the network already there. The argument is plausible in theory but fails badly in practice. Consider MySpace. In early February 2007, MySpace had 153.5 million users. Victor Keegan of The Guardian seemed to think that it would only grow. It shrank. What replaced it? Facebook. So much for the overwhelming power of network effects. It's not that network effects don't matter. They do. But innovations strike at the foundations and very lives of firms that thought they had solid network effects.</p><p>Which brings us to the tech sector. In a July 29 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats stepped up to show both their ignorance about and hostility towards the tech sector. One view that seemed widely held by both Republicans and Democrats is that companies in the tech sector are monopolies. Fortunately, economist Alec Stapp, Director of Technology Policy at the Progressive Policy Institute has punctured the dominant myths about big tech and antitrust. His analysis is a tour de force and I won't try to replicate it here. But I will highlight his finding that the big tech companies are not monopolies. He noted, for instance, that Facebook has 23 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market and Google has 29 percent. Those two also fiercely compete with each other.</p><p>Does my analysis mean that all is good in the world of competition? Not at all. There are serious lapses in competition, but most of them are due to government policy.</p><p>I referred earlier to how most economists use the term \"monopoly.\" But there's an older tradition that the late University of Chicago economist George Stigler discussed in his article \"Monopoly\" in The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics. In this tradition, monopoly refers to an industry in which the government forcibly restrains competition.</p><p>Governments in the United States limit competition in four main ways (1) restrictions on entry into an industry, (2) tariffs and import quotas, (3) regulation that appears neutral but is not, and (4) patents and copyrights</p><p>Consider restrictions on entry. Government does so in two main ways: with regulations that require government permission for firms to enter and with occupational licensing regulations that require individuals to get permission to enter a profession. An example of the first is Certificate of Need (CON) regulation that gives existing medical firms standing to argue against competition from new hospitals and clinics. Among the most extreme such laws are those in Illinois. In his 2008 book, Code Red, Northwestern University health economist David Dranove pointed out one unintended but totally predictable result of Illinois's CON laws: Illinois hospitals are located where Illinoisans lived in the 1950s. What an apt acronym: Those laws really are a con. Indeed, they played a role in former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich's becoming a con himself.</p><p>I've discussed the problem with occupational licensing on this site earlier. The good news is that economists, including the Obama CEA, have in recent years criticized occupational licensing.</p><p>Another government-imposed restriction of competition is protectionism in the form of tariffs and import quotas. The whole point of such restrictions is to limit competition. The U.S. economy is less competitive than it would be if we had completely free trade.</p><p>The third way governments restrict competition is with regulations that appear neutral but limit competition through economies of scale in compliance. A given regulation might cause a firm with $10 billion in sales to spend $10 million to help it comply. That expenditure is 1/1000 of sales. But to comply with that same regulation, a firm with only $100 million in sales might need to spend $1 million. That's 1/100 of sales, which is 10 times as much as the large firm's expense. This can force out small firms, making an industry less competitive than otherwise. Indeed, in my 1976 Ph.D. dissertation, I showed that this was exactly what happened with the coal industry in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p><p>I won't discuss patents and copyrights here other than to note two things. First, there is a large controversy among economists about whether these are a good idea. The best argument for them is that they create an incentive to innovate. But, as I point out in \"Patents,\" in the first edition of The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, there are some downsides. One is that many inventions would have happened without patents and so the monopolies that patents create in those cases are unnecessary. Another is that the prospect of a patent can divert innovators away from unpatentable innovations to patentable ones. The second thing to note is that in a world with the Food and Drug Administration regulating the flow of new drugs, we would have almost zero new drugs without patents.</p><p>Is competition alive and well in the United States? In the areas where government allows it, yes. In areas where the government restricts competition, no.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123885184</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KR-D5X1-JCBF-S40D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
